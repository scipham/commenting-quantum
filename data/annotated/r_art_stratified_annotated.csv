The quantum computer Sycamore reportedly performed a calculation that even the most powerful supercomputers available couldn’t reproduce.'];[nan];2019-10-23;"Science News Magazine; Emily Conover";Google officially lays claim to quantum supremacy;"Quantum supremacy is here, researchers from Google claim.
For the first time, a quantum computer has solved a problem that can’t be performed by a standard computer — at least not within a reasonable amount of time — Google announced October 23. This milestone, known as quantum supremacy, is a long-anticipated step toward useful quantum computers.
The researchers performed the task with a chip consisting of only 53 qubits, the quantum version of the bits found in everyday computers. “It’s fascinating that we can do something so powerful with such a small chip,” says quantum physicist Mária Kieferová of the University of Technology Sydney, who was not involved with the study.
But don’t expect quantum computers to suddenly take over. The calculation Google’s quantum computer performed was not a particularly useful one. Instead, the task at hand was one that was designed to play to quantum computers’ strengths and to be difficult for a nonquantum, or “classical,” computer.
What’s more, some researchers are pushing back against Google’s quantum supremacy claim, arguing that the milestone has yet to be achieved.
For about a month, rumors have been swirling among scientists that Google would soon report its achievement of quantum supremacy (SN: 9/21/19). The company’s official announcement, in a study published October 23 in Nature, follows the apparently unintentional posting of an earlier version of the study on a NASA website in September. That paper was swiftly taken down, but copies of it persisted and were shared among researchers.
The concept of quantum supremacy, proposed in 2012 by theoretical physicist John Preskill, has attracted controversy. The term lends itself to hype, and some quantum physicists prefer to focus on metrics that imply practical usefulness — which supremacy does not.
But, says Preskill, of Caltech, the demonstration of quantum supremacy is not only a milestone in computing, but also an advance in scientists’ understanding of quantum mechanics. Making a computer that can perform complex quantum calculations on the scale of quantum supremacy is “an exploration of physics that we’ve never been able to do before,” he says.
Using the computer, named Sycamore, Google researchers performed a task called random circuit sampling. Essentially, the team performed a sequence of randomized operations on the qubits. “It’s literally as if the code of their program was chosen randomly,” says computer scientist Bill Fefferman of the University of Chicago.
Then the researchers measured the values of all the qubits. After repeating the process multiple times, the team got a distribution of numbers that was close to random — but not quite, thanks to quantum effects. That resulting distribution is very difficult to calculate via a classical computer. While it takes Sycamore 200 seconds to repeat the sampling process a million times, a state-of-the-art supercomputer, the most powerful type of classical computer available, would take 10,000 years to do the same task, the team reports.
“With the first quantum computation that cannot reasonably be emulated on a classical computer, we have opened up a new realm of computing to be explored,” Google researchers John Martinis and Sergio Boixo wrote October 23 in a post on Google’s AI blog. That’s because quantum supremacy is a challenge to an idea known as the extended Church-Turing thesis, a principle of computer science, which states that all reasonable types of computation can be performed by classical computers. If the supremacy claim is correct, it would be the first violation of that principle.
However, on October 21, even before Google scientists officially unveiled their claim, researchers from IBM were challenging it. In a paper posted at arXiv.org, IBM researchers suggested that the calculation that Google says would take 10,000 years could instead be performed in 2.5 days on a classical computer using an improved technique, though it would still require the most powerful supercomputer on the planet.
IBM has a competing quantum computing effort, which has also developed a 53-qubit quantum computer. The team, however, favors a different performance metric than quantum supremacy known as quantum volume, which incorporates a variety of factors such as how error-prone the qubits are and how long they retain their quantum properties. In an October 21 blog post, those IBM researchers argue that their result means that Google hasn’t achieved quantum supremacy after all. IBM has not yet used a supercomputer to perform such a computation, however, so that leaves the quantum supremacy result in a “gray territory,” Kieferová says.
Still, quantum supremacy is not a straightforward line to be crossed, says quantum physicist Simon Devitt, also of the University of Technology Sydney. Instead, there’s a nebulous buffer zone. That’s where the new result falls, he says. But “the supremacy stuff is not what really excites me,” he says. Instead, what gets him going is the new level of control over famously finicky qubits.
“In the end,” Martinis said in a news conference on October 23, “this experiment is about building the most powerful quantum computer in the world right now and showing that … things are working well.”
Once physicists master the control of quantum computers, the machines could be scaled up to assist with useful problems, like studying the physics that underlies chemical reactions or even cracking encryption techniques used to secure online communications. But those achievements remain far in the future, researchers agree. Quantum supremacy is a step in that direction.
“I think the jury is still out as to whether this is really quantum supremacy,” Fefferman says. But, “no matter what happens, I’m convinced it’s an impressive experiment. They’re paving new ground, and they’re going where no one has gone before.”";5873;['f4uqi8i', 'f4uu2on', 'f4vb0vz', 'f4vfewu', 'f4vgg7b', 'f4vmc8b', 'f4vp03d', 'f4vq0ll', 'f4vq3tx', 'f4vtkqf', 'f4vu6gz', 'f4vx6aw', 'f4vxpvu', 'f4w0lc6', 'f4w39x2', 'f4w5ynm', 'f4w77ca', 'f4w9ckh', 'f4w9hdo', 'f4wcajo', 'f4wf2jh', 'f4wfwl3', 'f4wgm3a', 'f4wko8x', 'f4wmkej', 'f4wrcc1', 'f4wvc6k', 'f4wyp0g', 'f4x9jm5', 'f4xgb17', 'f4xp2km', 'f4xsz7b', 'f4xvsm3', 'f4xzt97', 'f4y29zq', 'f4y7fp9', 'f4yjkug', 'f4ymtur', 'f4yn2du', 'f4yo5ed'];304;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.75];[0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.0, 0.125, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0];0.375;0.43125;0.45414755311462374;0.3136852522832401;15.0;17.25

His Twilight Zone was a dimension of imagination, a dimension of sight and sound and mind, a dimension as vast as space and timeless as infinity. It was all very clear except for the space and time part, the dimensions of real life. Serling never explained them.
Of course, ever since Einstein, scientists have also been scratching their heads about how to make sense of space and time. Before then, almost everybody thought Isaac Newton had figured it all out. Time “flows equably without relation to anything external,” he declared. Absolute space is also its own thing, “always similar and immovable.” Nothing to see there. Events of physical reality performed independently on a neutral stage where actors strutted and fretted without influencing the rest of the theater.
But Einstein’s theories turned Newton’s absolute space and time into a relativistic mash-up — his equations suggested a merged space-time, a new sort of arena in which the players altered the space of the playing field. It was a physics game changer. No longer did space and time provide a featureless backdrop for matter and energy. Formerly independent and uniform, space and time became inseparable and variable. And as Einstein showed in his general theory of relativity, matter and energy warped the space-time surrounding them. That simple (hah!) truth explained gravity. Newton’s apparent force of attraction became an illusion perpetrated by space-time geometry. It was the shape of space-time that dictated the motion of massive bodies, a symmetric justice since massive bodies determined space-time’s shape.
Verification of Einstein’s space-time revolution came a century ago, when an eclipse expedition confirmed his general theory’s prime prediction (a precise amount of bending of light passing near the edge of a massive body, in this case the Sun). But space-time remained mysterious. Since it was something rather than nothing, it was natural to wonder where it came from.
Now a new revolution is on the verge of answering that question, based on insights from the other great physics surprise of the last century: quantum mechanics. Today’s revolution offers the potential for yet another rewrite of space-time’s résumé, with the bonus of perhaps explaining why quantum mechanics seems so weird.
“Space-time and gravity must ultimately emerge from something else,” writes physicist Brian Swingle in the 2018 Annual Review of Condensed Matter Physics. Otherwise it’s hard to see how Einstein’s gravity and the math of quantum mechanics can reconcile their longstanding incompatibility. Einstein’s view of gravity as the manifestation of space-time geometry has been enormously successful. But so also has been quantum mechanics, which describes the machinations of matter and energy on the atomic scale with unerring accuracy. Attempts to find coherent math that accommodates quantum weirdness with geometric gravity, though, have met formidable technical and conceptual roadblocks.
At least that has long been so for attempts to understand ordinary space-time. But clues to a possible path to progress have emerged from the theoretical study of alternate space-time geometries, thinkable in principle but with unusual properties. One such alternate, known as anti de Sitter space, is weirdly curved and tends to collapse on itself, rather than expanding as the universe we live in does. It wouldn’t be a nice place to live. But as a laboratory for studying theories of quantum gravity, it has a lot to offer. “Quantum gravity is sufficiently rich and confusing that even toy universes can shed enormous light on the physics,” writes Swingle, of the University of Maryland.";3704;['emugsox', 'emujc0u', 'emum3ze', 'emumaxo', 'emumxju', 'emumy90', 'emunx45', 'emuqpk5', 'emus7b6', 'emuvbrz', 'emuy2zf', 'emv09fm', 'emv4riv', 'emv5zh5', 'emv6gzp', 'emv8n44', 'emv98fm', 'emva7jt', 'emvekhf', 'emvh9pc', 'emvir6o', 'emvxdmr', 'emvydvj', 'emvygv5', 'emw5l5c', 'emw6k8q', 'emw7ns4', 'emwae0l', 'emwasju', 'emwcksb', 'emwcvpt', 'emwej15', 'emwk1w0', 'emwkp35', 'emwom4g', 'emwpzev', 'emwwuqo', 'emx8m8d', 'emxadtx', 'en0erby'];187;1;[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0];[0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.875, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.875, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 0.875, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25];0.35;0.525;0.4394598957811736;0.24399026619928918;14.0;21.0

Another version of you might already know it.;"Ever wonder what would have happened if you'd taken up the ""Hey, let's get coffee"" offer from that cool classmate you once had? If you believe some of today’s top physicists, such questions are more than idle what-ifs. Maybe a version of you in another world did go on that date, and is now celebrating your 10th wedding anniversary.
The idea that there are multiple versions of you, existing across worlds too numerous to count, is a long way from our intuitive experience. It sure looks and feels like each of us is just one person living just one life, waking up every day in the same, one-and-only world.
But according to an increasingly popular analysis of quantum mechanics known as the “many worlds interpretation,” every fundamental event that has multiple possible outcomes — whether it’s a particle of light hitting Mars or a molecule in the flame bouncing off your teapot — splits the world into alternate realities.
Multiple splits, multiple worlds
Even to seasoned scientists, it’s odd to think that the universe splits apart depending on whether a molecule bounces this way or that way. It’s odder still to realize that a similar splitting could occur for every interaction taking place in the quantum world.
Things get downright bizarre when you realize that all those subatomic splits would also apply to bigger things, including ourselves. Maybe there’s a world in which a version of you split off and bought a winning lottery ticket. Or maybe in another, you tripped at the top of a cliff and fell to your death — oops.
“It's absolutely possible that there are multiple worlds where you made different decisions. We're just obeying the laws of physics,” says Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and the author of a new book on many worlds titled ""Something Deeply Hidden."" Just how many versions of you might there be? “We don't know whether the number of worlds is finite or infinite, but it's certainly a very large number,"" Carroll says. ""There’s no way it’s, like, five.”
Carroll is aware that the many worlds interpretation sounds like something plucked from a science fiction movie. (It doesn’t help that he was an adviser on ""Avengers: Endgame."") And like a Hollywood blockbuster, the many worlds interpretation attracts both passionate fans and scathing critics.
Renowned theorist Roger Penrose of Oxford University dismisses the idea as “reductio ad absurdum”: physics reduced to absurdity. On the other hand, Penrose’s former collaborator, the late Stephen Hawking, described the many worlds interpretation as “self-evidently true.”
Carroll himself is comfortable with the idea that he’s but one of many Sean Carrolls running around in alternate versions of reality. “The concept of a single person extending from birth to death was always just a useful approximation,” he writes in his new book, and to him the many worlds interpretation merely extends that idea: “The world duplicates, and everything within the world goes along with it.”
How did we get here?
The mind-bending saga of the many worlds interpretation began in 1926, when Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger mathematically demonstrated that the subatomic world is fundamentally blurry.
In the familiar, human-scale reality, an object exists in one well-defined place: Place your phone on your bedside table, and that’s the only spot it can be, whether or not you're looking for it. But in the quantum realm, objects exist in a smudge of probability, snapping into focus only when observed.
“Before you look at an object, whether it's an electron, or an atom or whatever, it's not in any definite location,” Carroll says. “It might be more likely that you observe it in one place or another, but it's not actually located at any particular place.”
Nearly a century of experimentation has confirmed that, strange as it seems, this phenomenon is a core aspect of the physical world. Even Einstein struggled with the notion: What happened to all of the other possible locations where the object could have been, and all the other different outcomes that could have ensued? Why should an object’s behavior depend on whether or not somebody was looking at it?
In 1957, a Princeton student named Hugh Everett III came up with a radical explanation. He proposed that all possible outcomes really do occur — but that only a single version plays out in the world we inhabit. All the other possibilities split off from us, each giving rise to its own separate world. Nothing ever goes to waste, in this view, since everything that can happen does happen in some world.
For decades, Everett’s colleagues mostly brushed aside his explanation, treating it more like a ghost story than serious science. But nobody has found any flaws in Schrödinger’s equation; nor can they explain away its implications. As a result, many contemporary physicists — including David Deutsch at Oxford University and Max Tegmark at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — have come to agree with Carroll that the many worlds interpretation is the only coherent way to understand quantum mechanics.
A field guide to many worlds
The many worlds interpretation raises all kinds of puzzling questions about the multiple versions of reality, and about the multiple versions of you that exist in them. Carroll has some answers.
If new universes are constantly popping into existence, isn’t something being created from nothing, violating one of the most basic principles of physics? Not so, according to Carroll: “It only looks like you are creating extra copies of the universe. It's better to think of it as taking a big thick universe and slicing it.”
Why do we experience one particular reality but none of the others? “What other one would you find yourself in?” Carroll says, amused. “It’s like asking why you live now instead of some other time. Everyone in every world thinks that they're in that world.”
Carroll also has a disappointing response for one of the most compelling questions of all: Could you cross over and visit one of the other realities and compare notes with an alternate-world version of yourself? “Once the other worlds come into existence, they go their own way,” Carroll says. “They don't interact, they don't influence each other in any form. Crossing over is like traveling faster than the speed of light. It's not something that you can do.”
War of the many worlds
One criticism of the many worlds interpretation is that while it offers a colorful way to think about the world, it doesn’t deliver any new insights into how nature works. “It is completely content-less,” says physicist Christopher Fuchs of the University of Massachusetts, Boston.
Fuchs favors an alternative called Quantum Bayesianism, which offers a path back to an old-fashioned single reality. He argues that the universe changes when you look at it not because you are creating new worlds but simply because observation requires interacting with your surroundings. No coffee dates, no other lives for you. “In this way, measurement is demoted from being something mystical to being about things as mundane as walking across a busy street: It’s an action I can take that clearly has consequences for me,” he says.
Coming at the critique from a different angle, Oxford's Roger Penrose argues that the whole idea of many worlds is flawed, because it’s based on an overly simplistic version of quantum mechanics that doesn’t account for gravity. “The rules must change when gravity is involved,” he says.
In a more complete quantum theory, Penrose argues, gravity helps anchor reality and blurry events will have only one allowable outcome. He points to a potentially decisive experiment now being carried out at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Leiden University in the Netherlands that's designed to directly observe how an object transforms from many possible locations to a single, fixed reality.
Carroll is unmoved by these alternative explanations, which he considers overly complicated and unsupported by data. The notion of multiple yous can be unnerving, he concedes. But to him the underlying concept of many worlds is “crisp, clear, beautiful, simple and pure.”
If he's right, he's not the only Sean Carroll who feels that way.";8257;['f4ukc7q', 'f4us7wq', 'f4usgw8', 'f4uu2g3', 'f4uvc3v', 'f4uvjrv', 'f4uwp92', 'f4uzuj3', 'f4v32tv', 'f4v3ipz', 'f4v3jvf', 'f4v3v58', 'f4v4glq', 'f4v4hoh', 'f4v65eu', 'f4v7a97', 'f4v9r1c', 'f4vd5jk', 'f4vh9ca', 'f4vmozj', 'f4vruza', 'f4vsa6j', 'f4vxien', 'f4vyhsn', 'f4w03cv', 'f4wgerd', 'f4wxkcr', 'f4xdaje', 'f4xjd5r', 'f4xjlu9', 'f4xmy68', 'f4xqnay', 'f4xqp55', 'f4xraig', 'f4xtihs', 'f4xto42', 'f4xv9q4', 'f4ybl21', 'f4z8h3v', 'f4zc9bq'];471;1;[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0];0.35625;0.396875;0.45030371695112625;0.22859540541095746;14.25;15.875

The findings, described in two Science papers on 6 May1,2, could help researchers to build measuring devices of unprecedented sensitivity, as well as quantum computers that can perform certain calculations beyond the reach of any ordinary computer.
The counter-intuitive rules of quantum mechanics predict that two objects can share a common, ‘entangled’ state. Measurable properties of one object, such as its position or velocity, are then correlated to those of the other, with a degree of correlation that is stronger than what can be achieved in classical, or non-quantum, physics.
Although nothing in the laws of quantum physics limits such quantum weirdness to subatomic particles, the theory predicts that at much larger scales — say, the size of a cat — quantum effects should be so vanishingly small as to be unobservable in practice. Physicists have long debated whether this is just a limitation of our senses and instruments, or whether macroscopic objects are governed by their own set of laws that is fundamentally different from quantum mechanics. To explore this question, researchers have been pushing to observe quantum effects at ever larger scales. “One point of our research is, is there quantum in the classical world?” says Mika Sillanpää, a physicist at Aalto University in Finland.
Quantum drums
In an experiment at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, physicist Shlomi Kotler and his collaborators built a pair of vibrating aluminium membranes akin to two tiny drums, each around 10 micrometres long.
Although these structures are barely visible to the naked eye, they are enormous by quantum standards, consisting of around one trillion atoms each. When physicists discovered quantum mechanics a century ago, “people didn’t imagine you could do an experiment with something this big”, says Kotler, who is now at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
The team tickled the membranes with microwave photons to make them vibrate in sync, and in such a way that their motions were in a quantum-entangled state: at any given time, as the drums wobbled up and down, measuring their displacement from flat showed they were in the same exact position, and probing their velocities returned exactly opposite values.
Two other laboratories had done similar measurements on macroscopic vibrating objects in the past, showing indirect evidence of entangled states3,4. But Kotler and his team were able to ‘see’ the entanglement more directly by amplifying the signal at the moment it came out of their devices. Kotler says this is similar to how old record players pre-amplified their signal before sending it to the amplifier, helping to reduce hiss. The team also improved upon earlier techniques, allowing the researchers to create entanglement more reliably.
Such steps will be crucial for applications such as quantum computers that could encode information in the vibrations of an array of membranes, Kotler says — a radical alternative to current popular approaches, which typically involve electrical currents or atomic systems. Amazon recently announced that it was investigating the possibility of using vibrating crystals to encode and process quantum information.
Testing limits
In a separate experiment with quantum drums, a group led by Sillanpää probed the limits of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that any measurement must necessarily change the state of the object which is being measured.
The team also built a pair of tiny aluminium drums, and used microwave-frequency photons both to put it in a synchronized vibrating pattern and to read out the drums’ positions.
This experiment had a different purpose to the one carried out by Kotler’s team — the researchers wanted to probe the boundary between quantum and non-quantum behaviour. They tuned the oscillating drums to move in a coordinated but not identical way, so that some of their measurable properties were identical to those of a single, virtual, oscillating drum.
In this way, the researchers were able to measure the position of the virtual drum without affecting its velocity. For a normal quantum oscillator, that would be impossible because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. To circumvent that fundamental limit, the researchers “use quantum mechanics to hack quantum mechanics”, says Hoi-Kwan Lau, a theoretical physicist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada.
As in Kotler’s experiment, the two drums shared an entangled state, and the measurement technique opens the possibility of studying how entanglement of large objects spontaneously evolves. “We can measure the entangled states continuously without destroying them,” says Laure Mercier de Lépinay, a colleague of Sillanpää at Aalto and a co-author of the paper.
The quantum-drum techniques could lead to the development of instrumentation that beats the limitations that quantum mechanics imposes on measurement. “One application would be for a force sensor,” says Lau.

The company has set up a new division, IBM Q, that is intended to make quantum computers and sell them commercially.
Until now, quantum computers have mostly been a much hyped but long away dream. But IBM believes they are close enough to reality to start work on getting software ready for when they become commercially available.
Quantum computers rely on quantum mechanics and the bizarre behaviour of quantum bits to do calculations far faster than any computer yet known.
Most researchers agree that the theoretical machines are still years away from actually being made, despite advances towards creating a working quantum computer. But IBM says that its work has shown enough promise to get working on programming the machines.
So far, IBM has demonstrated systems that use quantum effects in small-scale demonstrations. They have taken advantage of effects like superpositioning, which means that electrons can exist in two states at the same time – behaviour that could in the future be harnessed to allow them to work in far more complex ways than the 1s and 0s that are used in today's computers.
That work has shown enough promise that IBM executives believe such computers could soon be made commercially available, they said. As such, the software and the technologies that will be required to run on those computers must be prepared now, they said.
As such it will create APIs that allow developers and programmers to start working on machines that will be able to send programmes between quantum computers and traditional ones. Later this year it will also release a simulator that can mimic the kind of circuits that will be inside quantum computers, allowing people to get to work making software for them.
Eventually those technologies could be put to work in industries like drug and materials discovery or as yet unimagined artificial intelligence.
“Classical computers are extraordinarily powerful and will continue to advance and underpin everything we do in business and society. But there are many problems that will never be penetrated by a classical computer. To create knowledge from much greater depths of complexity, we need a quantum computer,” said Tom Rosamilia, senior vice president of IBM Systems. “We envision IBM Q systems working in concert with our portfolio of classical high-performance systems to address problems that are currently unsolvable, but hold tremendous untapped value.”";2550;['dekmvh4', 'dekpvjm', 'dekqbvl', 'dektd8y', 'dektsdd', 'dekuhki', 'dekvbjd', 'dekxy3u', 'dekz2z5', 'dekz68f', 'dekz6vp', 'del1j1e', 'del2816', 'del2vhz', 'del37y5', 'del3ha0', 'del3o1x', 'del4lv8', 'del4u67', 'del5e7c', 'del5ipf', 'del62pw', 'del68s8', 'del7b6d', 'del7cty', 'del7nep', 'del7ujs', 'del8a5c', 'del9z97', 'deliyfa', 'delk98u', 'delkv4m', 'delldnd', 'delnw7e', 'delrjqq', 'dem1i8c', 'dem1jda', 'dem2142', 'dem391c', 'dem9sia'];164;1;[0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];[0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.625, 0.75, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.125, 0.0, 1.0];0.3;0.309375;0.4337337893224368;0.30997416727043564;12.0;12.375

A team of researchers affiliated with several institutions in China has built and tested a photonic quantum computer that demonstrates quantum supremacy. In their paper published in the journal Science, the group describes their computer, which they call Jiuzhang, and how well it performed while conducting Gaussian boson sampling.
Quantum computers have been in the news lately as scientists try to determine if they can meet expectations. Quantum computers could vastly outperform conventional machines on certain tasks. The goal is to achieve what has come to be known as"" quantum supremacy""—where a quantum computer can outperform conventional computers on at least one type of task. Until now, only one computer has ever achieved this feat—Google's Sycamore device. And because the field is still so new, researchers around the world are working on vastly different designs. Sycamore was based on qubits represented by superconducting materials. In this new effort, the team in China has developed a photon-based quantum computer capable of carrying out a single specific type of calculation—boson sampling.
Boson sampling is a means for calculating the output of a straight-line optical circuit that has multiple inputs and outputs. It is carried out by constructing a machine in which photons are sent into a circuit in parallel, and once inside, are split by beam splitters. The split photons continue through the circuit, encountering mirrors and other beam splitters. Notably, if two photons happen to encounter the same splitter simultaneously, both unsplit photons will follow one of the paths away from the splitter. The process is repeated, resulting in a distribution of numbers that represent the network output. Conventional computers become bogged down very quickly when trying to calculate distributions of such a system. Jiuzhang was built to handle 100 inputs and 100 outputs using 300 beam splitters and 75 mirrors.
The researchers found that it took Jiuzhang approximately 200 seconds to provide an answer. They noted that it would have taken the world's fastest supercomputer approximately 2.5 billion years to carry out the same calculations—a clear example of quantum supremacy.";2270;['gexcsx8', 'gexcx0y', 'gexdehw', 'gexja36', 'gexkwnu', 'gexmpar', 'gexr816', 'gexs1i2', 'gext36w', 'gexywhh', 'gexzg3r', 'gey0ll0', 'gey4m1t', 'gey8au6', 'gey9l5t', 'geyayjc', 'geyex0l', 'geyf3pk', 'geyglfw', 'geyj6pn', 'geyk2s7', 'geykjzo', 'geykzbr', 'geylx4t', 'geyn023', 'geyn65d', 'geysejh', 'geyw34o', 'gez3uet', 'gez8at0', 'gez8bhp', 'gezjjjo', 'gezkmht', 'gezrcqw', 'geztobg', 'gezve61', 'gezx5zc', 'gf0ml3u', 'gf0uxh7', 'gf1m6k7'];316;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0];[1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5];0.2875;0.3875;0.4277484658067168;0.28476964374736297;11.5;15.5

Dubbed Eagle, the 127-qubit processor becomes the first of its kind to deliver more than 100 qubits. To illustrate just how powerful quantum computing systems are, it’s been a requirement until recently that their qubits have to be cooled at temperatures as cold as outer space.
In order to demonstrate the power of Eagle, IBM highlighted how a computer has typically required more bits than atoms found in every human in the world to successfully simulate the processor.
Due to the substantial quantity of qubits, Eagle is claimed to be the first processor ever created that cannot be simulated on a classic supercomputer.
By increasing the amount of qubits in a quantum computer, it allows highly sophisticated programs to function on such systems that would otherwise not be capable of running on a standard supercomputer.
“The arrival of the Eagle processor is a major step toward the day when quantum computers can outperform classical computers at meaningful levels,” said Dr. Darío Gil, senior vice president and director of research at IBM. “Quantum computing has the power to transform nearly every sector and help us tackle the biggest problems of our time.”
IBM aims to achieve “quantum advantage” by 2023.
The processor architecture of Eagle features new methods that place control components on several physical levels, while qubits have been incorporated into their own level.
IBM also noted how it had to combine and improve techniques that originated in previous generations of IBM quantum processors so it could develop an architecture that includes advanced 3D packaging techniques. Ultimately, such functionality will allow the company to provide a strong foundation for its processors, which includes the forthcoming 1000-plus-qubit Condor chip.
As for plans pertaining to future IBM quantum systems, Condor in particular is expected to contain 1,121 qubits in total upon its planned launch in 2023. Eagle’s immediate successor, the 433-qubit Osprey, is scheduled for a 2022 release.
The company also aims to achieve “quantum advantage” by 2023. The term is attributed to quantum computers that can solve problems that are impossible to crack via a classical computer. Condor’s capabilities will help in accomplishing this goal.
Eagle will become available to select members of IBM’s Quantum Network, who have remote access to IBM’s quantum computers, in December. IBM will divulge more information related to its quantum systems at its annual Quantum Summit event taking place tomorrow, November 16.";2657;['hkucw96', 'hkugibg', 'hkui1ak', 'hkumfg8', 'hkuoerk', 'hkuojua', 'hkuu6yi', 'hkuvw3b', 'hkuyc6j', 'hkuyh2r', 'hkuzr6p', 'hkv74q2', 'hkvdtgh', 'hkvedul', 'hkvhohw', 'hkvj38b', 'hkvmbyx', 'hkvnbr0', 'hkvrpgj', 'hkvwek6', 'hkvybf9', 'hkw1uh4', 'hkw219a', 'hkw2cn8', 'hkw58xk', 'hkw7dmz', 'hkwe4vm', 'hkwqig3', 'hkwxjcs', 'hkx10fj', 'hkx4vu0', 'hkx5tf3', 'hkx6t93', 'hkx738n', 'hkx83vq', 'hkxj22z', 'hkxkg7v', 'hkxrvfb', 'hkykiwc', 'hkz6mj0'];93;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0];[0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.875, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5];0.325;0.409375;0.44087980221371;0.28365292943137393;13.0;16.375

The matter phase relies on a quirk of the Fibonacci sequence to remain in a quantum state for longer.
Just as ordinary matter can be in a solid, liquid, gas, or superheated plasmic phase (or state), quantum materials also have phases. The phase refers to how the matter is structured on an atomic level—the arrangement of its atoms or its electrons, for example. Several years ago, physicists discovered a quantum supersolid, and last year, a team confirmed the existence of quantum spin liquids, a long-suspected phase of quantum matter, in a simulator. The recent team thinks they’ve discovered another new phase.
Quantum bits, or qubits, are like ordinary computer bits in that their values can be 0 or 1, but they can also be 0 or 1 simultaneously, a state of ambiguity that allows the computers to consider many possible solutions to a problem much faster than an ordinary computer. Quantum computers should eventually be able to solve problems that classical computers can’t.
Qubits are often atoms; in the recent case, the researchers used 10 ytterbium ions, which were controlled by electric fields and manipulated using laser pulses. When multiple qubits’ states can be described in relation to one another, the qubits are considered entangled. Quantum entanglement is a delicate agreement between multiple qubits in a system, and the agreement is dissolved the moment any one of those bits’ values is certain. At that moment, the system decoheres, and the quantum operation falls apart.
A big challenge of quantum computing is maintaining the quantum state of qubits. The slightest fluctuations in temperature, vibrations, or electromagnetic fields can cause the supersensitive qubits to decohere and their calculations to fall apart. Since the longer the qubits stay quantum, the more you can get done, making computers’ quantum states persist for as long as possible is a crucial step for the field.
In the recent research, pulsing a laser periodically at the 10 ytterbium qubits kept them in a quantum state—meaning entangled—for 1.5 seconds. But when the researchers pulsed the lasers in the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence, they found that the qubits on the edge of the system remained in a quantum state for about 5.5 seconds, the entire length of the experiment (the qubits could have remained in a quantum state for longer, but the team ended the experiment at the 5.5-second mark). Their research was published this summer in Nature.
You can think of the Fibonacci sequence laser pulses as two frequencies that never overlap. That makes the pulses a quasicrystal: a pattern that has order, but no periodicity.
“The key result in my mind was showing the difference between these two different ways to engineer these quantum states and how one was better at protecting it from errors than the other,” said study co-author Justin Bohnet, a quantum engineer at Quantinuum, the company whose computer was used in the recent experiment.
The Fibonacci sequence is a numeric pattern in which each number is the sum of the two previous numbers (so 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). Its history goes back over 2,000 years and is connected to the so-called golden ratio. Now, the unique series may have quantum implications.
“It turns out that if you engineer laser pulses in the correct way, your quantum system can have symmetries that come from time translation,” said Philipp Dumitrescu, the paper’s lead author and a quantum physicist who conducted the work while at the Flatiron Institute. A time-translation symmetry means that an experiment will yield the same result, regardless of whether it takes place today, tomorrow, or 100 years from now.
“What we realized is that by using quasi-periodic sequences based on the Fibonacci pattern, you can have the system behave as if there are two distinct directions of time,” Dumitrescu added.
Shooting the qubits with laser pulses with a periodic (a simple A-B-A-B) pattern didn’t prolong the system’s quantum state. But by pulsing the laser in a Fibonacci sequence (A-AB-ABA-ABAAB, and so on), the researchers gave the qubits a non-repeating, or quasi-periodic, pattern.
It’s similar to the quasicrystals from the Trinity nuclear test site, but instead of being a three-dimensional quasicrystal, the physicists made a quasicrystal in time. In both cases, symmetries that exist at higher dimensions can be projected in a lower dimension, like the tessellated patterns in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling.
“With this quasi-periodic sequence, there’s a complicated evolution that cancels out all the errors that live on the edge,” Dumitrescu said in a Simons Foundation release. By on the edge, he’s referring to the qubits farthest from the center of their configuration at any one time. “Because of that, the edge stays quantum-mechanically coherent much, much longer than you’d expect.” The Fibonacci-pattern laser pulses made the edge qubits more robust.
More robust, longer-lived quantum systems are a vital need for the future of quantum computing. If it takes shooting qubits with a very specific mathematical rhythm of laser pulses to keep a quantum computer in an entangled state, then physicists had better start blasting.";5357;['it23oql', 'it28o2i', 'it28wys', 'it29lno', 'it2a0tg', 'it2e1g1', 'it2gitd', 'it2pqvt', 'it2w838', 'it2xzio', 'it37ez6', 'it3821m', 'it3f3rm', 'it3gpc2', 'it3hqur', 'it3idz5', 'it3noyy', 'it3ns25', 'it3r6o6', 'it3rr76', 'it3t0kp', 'it3xagb', 'it41mw9', 'it42sxx', 'it435vm', 'it46o7c', 'it4dtn2', 'it4fard', 'it4l2hc', 'it4oggd', 'it4qjyc', 'it4sbbk', 'it4w3dm', 'it5gfou', 'it5juhx', 'it5s8gk', 'it5v1b3', 'it6tdq6', 'it75joi', 'it8izfj'];231;1;[0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0];[1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.19375;0.4875;0.33767356648100244;0.22500000000000003;7.75;19.5

That's big news, because it shows similar devices could help us unlock the quantum secrets hidden in the chemistry that surrounds us.
Researchers working with the Google team were able to accurately simulate the energy of hydrogen H2 molecules, and if we can repeat the trick for other molecules, we could see the benefits in everything from solar cells to medicines.
These types of predictions are often impossible for 'classical' computers or take an extremely long time – working out the energy of something like a propane (C3H8) molecule would take a supercomputer in the region of 10 days.
To achieve the feat, Google's engineers teamed up with researchers from Harvard University, Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, UC Santa Barbara, Tufts University, and University College London in the UK.
""While the energies of molecular hydrogen can be computed classically (albeit inefficiently), as one scales up quantum hardware it becomes possible to simulate even larger chemical systems, including classically intractable ones,"" writes Google Quantum Software Engineer Ryan Babbush.
Chemical reactions are quantum in nature, because they form highly entangled quantum superposition states. In other words, each particle's state can't be described independently of the others, and that causes problems for computers used to dealing in binary values of 1s and 0s.
Enter Google's universal quantum computer, which deals in qubits – bits that themselves can be in a state of superposition, representing both 1 and 0 at the same time.
To run the simulation, the engineers used a supercooled quantum computing circuit called a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) – essentially a highly advanced modelling system that attempts to mimic our brain's own neural networks on a quantum level.
When the results of the VQE were compared against the actual released energy of the hydrogen molecule, the curves matched almost exactly, as you can see in the graph above.
Babbush explains that going from qualitative and descriptive chemistry simulations to quantitative and predictive ones ""could modernise the field so dramatically that the examples imaginable today are just the tip of the iceberg"".
We're dealing with the very first steps of modelling reality, and Google says we could start to see applications in all kinds of systems involving chemistry: improved batteries, flexible electronics, new types of materials, and more.
One potential use is modelling the way bacteria produce fertiliser. The way humans produce fertiliser is extremely inefficient in terms of the environment, and costs 1-2 percent of the world's energy per year – so any improvements in understanding the chemical reactions involved could produce massive gains.
It's still early days though, and while we've described Google's hardware as a quantum computer for simplicity's sake, there's still an ongoing debate over whether we've cracked the quantum computing code just yet.
Some say Google's machine is still a prototype, part-quantum computer rather than the real deal.

The law is related to the idea of the arrow of time that posits the one-way direction of time: from the past to the future']";[nan];2019-03-13;;Physicists reverse time using quantum computer;"Researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology teamed up with colleagues from the U.S. and Switzerland and returned the state of a quantum computer a fraction of a second into the past. They also calculated the probability that an electron in empty interstellar space will spontaneously travel back into its recent past. The study comes out March 13 in Scientific Reports.
""This is one in a series of papers on the possibility of violating the second law of thermodynamics. That law is closely related to the notion of the arrow of time that posits the one-way direction of time: from the past to the future,"" commented the study's lead author Gordey Lesovik, who heads the Laboratory of the Physics of Quantum Information Technology at MIPT.
""We began by describing a so-called local perpetual motion machine of the second kind. Then, in December, we published a paper that discusses the violation of the second law via a device called a Maxwell's demon,"" Lesovik said. ""The most recent paper approaches the same problem from a third angle: We have artificially created a state that evolves in a direction opposite to that of the thermodynamic arrow of time.""
What makes the future different from the past
Most laws of physics make no distinction between the future and the past. For example, let an equation describe the collision and rebound of two identical billiard balls. If a close-up of that event is recorded with a camera and played in reverse, it can still be represented by the same equation. Moreover, one could not tell from the recording if it has been doctored. Both versions look plausible. It would appear that the billiard balls defy the intuitive sense of time.
However, imagine that someone has recorded a cue ball breaking the pyramid, the billiard balls scattering in all directions. One need not know the rules of the game to tell the real-life scenario from reverse playback. What makes the latter look so absurd is our intuitive understanding of the second law of thermodynamics: An isolated system either remains static or evolves toward a state of chaos rather than order.
Most other laws of physics do not prevent rolling billiard balls from assembling into a pyramid, infused tea from flowing back into the tea bag, or a volcano from ""erupting"" in reverse. But we do not see any of this happening, because that would require an isolated system to assume a more ordered state without any outside intervention, which runs contrary to the second law. The nature of that law has not been explained in full detail, but researchers have made great headway in understanding the basic principles behind it.
Spontaneous time reversal
Quantum physicists from MIPT decided to check if time could spontaneously reverse itself at least for an individual particle and for a tiny fraction of a second. That is, instead of colliding billiard balls, they examined a solitary electron in empty interstellar space.
""Suppose the electron is localized when we begin observing it. This means that we're pretty sure about its position in space. The laws of quantum mechanics prevent us from knowing it with absolute precision, but we can outline a small region where the electron is localized,"" says study co-author Andrey Lebedev from MIPT and ETH Zurich.
The physicist explains that the evolution of the electron state is governed by Schrödinger's equation. Although it makes no distinction between the future and the past, the region of space containing the electron will spread out very quickly. That is, the system tends to become more chaotic. The uncertainty of the electron's position is growing. This is analogous to the increasing disorder in a large-scale system -- such as a billiard table -- due to the second law of thermodynamics.
""However, Schrödinger's equation is reversible,"" adds Valerii Vinokur, a co-author of the paper, from the Argonne National Laboratory, U.S. ""Mathematically, it means that under a certain transformation, called complex conjugation, the equation will describe a 'smeared' electron localizing back into a small region of space over the same time period."" Although this phenomenon is not observed in nature, it could theoretically happen due to a random fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background permeating the universe.
The team set out to calculate the probability to observe an electron ""smeared out"" over a fraction of a second spontaneously localizing into its recent past. It turned out that even if one spent the entire lifetime of the universe -- 13.7 billion years -- observing 10 billion freshly localized electrons every second, the reverse evolution of the particle's state would only happen once. And even then, the electron would travel no more than a mere one ten-billionth of a second into the past.
Large-scale phenomena involving billiard balls, volcanoes, etc. obviously unfold on much greater timescales and feature an astounding number of electrons and other particles. This explains why we do not observe old people growing younger or an ink blot separating from the paper.
Reversing time on demand
The researchers then attempted to reverse time in a four-stage experiment. Instead of an electron, they observed the state of a quantum computer made of two and later three basic elements called superconducting qubits.
Stage 1: Order. Each qubit is initialized in the ground state, denoted as zero. This highly ordered configuration corresponds to an electron localized in a small region, or a rack of billiard balls before the break.
Stage 2: Degradation. The order is lost. Just like the electron is smeared out over an increasingly large region of space, or the rack is broken on the pool table, the state of the qubits becomes an ever more complex changing pattern of zeros and ones. This is achieved by briefly launching the evolution program on the quantum computer. Actually, a similar degradation would occur by itself due to interactions with the environment. However, the controlled program of autonomous evolution will enable the last stage of the experiment.
Stage 3: Time reversal. A special program modifies the state of the quantum computer in such a way that it would then evolve ""backwards,"" from chaos toward order. This operation is akin to the random microwave background fluctuation in the case of the electron, but this time it is deliberately induced. An obviously far-fetched analogy for the billiards example would be someone giving the table a perfectly calculated kick.
Stage 4: Regeneration. The evolution program from the second stage is launched again. Provided that the ""kick"" has been delivered successfully, the program does not result in more chaos but rather rewinds the state of the qubits back into the past, the way a smeared electron would be localized or the billiard balls would retrace their trajectories in reverse playback, eventually forming a triangle.
The researchers found that in 85 percent of the cases the two-qubit quantum computer indeed returned back into the initial state. When three qubits were involved, more errors happened, resulting in a roughly 50 percent success rate. According to the authors, these errors are due to imperfections in the actual quantum computer. As more sophisticated devices are designed, the error rate is expected to drop.
Interestingly, the time reversal algorithm itself could prove useful for making quantum computers more precise. ""Our algorithm could be updated and used to test programs written for quantum computers and eliminate noise and errors,"" Lebedev explained.";7551;['eigvxzl', 'eigxi1j', 'eigxmh7', 'eigymoa', 'eih0hum', 'eih13lw', 'eih5233', 'eih7ak3', 'eih97qf', 'eihb46h', 'eihbkns', 'eihblcu', 'eihcyse', 'eiheevv', 'eihflzj', 'eihg535', 'eihnkvq', 'eihp44h', 'eihpqvi', 'eihqcn8', 'eihrcgj', 'eihrolz', 'eihrv6z', 'eihs7pu', 'eihvoiz', 'eihvy2g', 'eihw2ow', 'eihwfsv', 'eihxadw', 'eihxprg', 'eii0jg5', 'eii20xj', 'eii2rtm', 'eii39lh', 'eii3qjd', 'eii6zvg', 'eii7pz8', 'eiicdol', 'eiieko2', 'eijlhrv'];223;1;[0.75, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0];[0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.125, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.625, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.375, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5];0.5125;0.54375;0.4839615170651485;0.2645012996187353;20.5;21.75

We say outrageously because that's one of the few adjectives that encapsulates the performance difference between both systems: the QPU, named Borealis, completed the computing task revolving on gaussian Boson sampling (GBS) in just 36 microseconds. According to the paper published in Nature (opens in new tab), today's algorithms and supercomputers - the highest-performing classical computing systems - would take an inhuman scale of 9,000 years to accomplish the same task. Nevertheless, it is enough for the team to claim the coveted quantum advantage (opens in new tab) badge of honor.
Remember that the basic unit of quantum computation, the qubit, can simultaneously represent 0 or a 1. The orders-of-magnitude higher performance in specific tasks than their classical counterparts comes from quantum computers not working on exact computation methods. Instead, they describe how probable a solution is - before making a measurement.
Sadly, there's no practical use for the GBS workload; it's one of the possible benchmarks for testing the performance of quantum processing solutions against classical computers, a space that's still teeming with benchmark standardization attempts from players such as IBM.
Xanadu's Borealis (opens in new tab) is based on the increasingly relevant photonics field as it applies to computing. Specific quantum computing chips use qubits borne from silicon quantum dots, topological superconductors, trapped ions, and other technologies, with some already employing photonics as scaling mechanisms to create interconnected QPUs.The Borealis QPU is photonics-based through and through, unlocking lightspeed-esque operations through its photon-based qubits. The researchers expect photonics-based quantum computing solutions to ultimately provide the most effective way to scale quantum computers' performance. It is mainly due to the advantages of time-domain multiplexing, which allows for multiple, independent data streams to travel simultaneously masked as a single, more complex signal.
The researchers managed to squeeze as many as 219 photon-based qubits onto the Borealis QPU - although the programmable nature of the gates means that that number isn't fixed, and the mean active number of photons was 129. That's still more than IBM's current Eagle QPU, which features 127 qubits - but the company's roadmap does lay out plans to introduce its Osprey QPU, which packs as many as 433 of IBM's superconducting transmon qubits, later this year.
Another element that allowed for the increased quantum performance of Xanadu's Borealis is that the researchers have designed their system with dynamic programmability on all implemented quantum gates. This base circuitry allows for quantum operations to be performed, employing varying numbers of qubits. The programmable aspect of Borealis' quantum gates thus unlocks an FPGA-like architecture that one can reconfigure according to the task.
The researchers further ensured that the computed solutions to the GBS task were correct, which should settle the debate on whether or not quantum advantage was achieved. Xanadu is now bound to continue developing its solution, showcasing very promising results.
Ultimately, they'll also have to convert Borealis into a commercially-available solution. However, researchers can already take the QPU for a spin through Xanadu's cloud and Amazon Braket. But the results bode well not only for the future of photonics but also for photonics-based quantum computing and should be one of the technologies to look at until the anticipated explosion in quantum computing capability currently expected by 2030.";3801;['ibofnzn', 'ibojqez', 'ibojvh0', 'ibokd1j', 'ibond8m', 'ibooeny', 'ibouonm', 'ibp0mis', 'ibp4hzb', 'ibpai3z', 'ibpb1ux', 'ibpdbpl', 'ibpf1vr', 'ibpl0vc', 'ibptu1j', 'ibpzak5', 'ibpzsh3', 'ibq2lxy', 'ibq43kc', 'ibq517f', 'ibq5kxg', 'ibqdgvo', 'ibqek4a', 'ibqgpt5', 'ibqi1kr', 'ibqkdcs', 'ibqt6z6', 'ibr0tpr', 'ibr57z5', 'ibratew', 'ibrek4w', 'ibrjplx', 'ibrju5i', 'ibrpb5j', 'ibrq9qm', 'ibrwrv4', 'ibs2yx2', 'ibsb9w2', 'ibt39yv', 'ibwm8ce'];210;1;[0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0];[0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 0.625, 0.875, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.625, 0.875, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.75];0.25;0.515625;0.414578098794425;0.306425332462902;10.0;20.625

Technology continues to move forward at incredible speeds and it seems like every week we learn about a new breakthrough that changes our minds about what is possible.
Researchers in Toronto used a photonic quantum computer chip to solve a sampling problem that went way beyond the fastest computers and algorithms.
The paper the researchers published says that the Borealis quantum chip took only 36 microseconds to solve a problem that would take supercomputers and algorithms 9,000 years to figure out.
Yes, you read that right…9,000 years.
The Borealis chip uses bursts of light to transmit quantum information and the researchers believe that this is a huge leap forward for quantum chips.
The authors of the study said,
“This work is a critical milestone on the path to a practical quantum computer, validating key technological features of photonics as a platform for this goal.”
Quantum computers are different from traditional computers and one major way is to process three units of data instead of only two. The computers we are used to use binary (0, 1) and quantum computers use what is called qubits (0, 1, both).

Theories based only on real numbers fail to explain the results of two new experiments. To explain the real world, imaginary numbers are necessary, according to a quantum experiment performed by a team of physicists.'];[nan];2021-12-15;"Science News Magazine; Emily Conover";Quantum physics requires imaginary numbers to explain reality;"Imaginary numbers might seem like unicorns and goblins — interesting but irrelevant to reality.
But for describing matter at its roots, imaginary numbers turn out to be essential. They seem to be woven into the fabric of quantum mechanics, the math describing the realm of molecules, atoms and subatomic particles. A theory obeying the rules of quantum physics needs imaginary numbers to describe the real world, two new experiments suggest.
Imaginary numbers result from taking the square root of a negative number. They often pop up in equations as a mathematical tool to make calculations easier. But everything we can actually measure about the world is described by real numbers, the normal, nonimaginary figures we’re used to (SN: 5/8/18). That’s true in quantum physics too. Although imaginary numbers appear in the inner workings of the theory, all possible measurements generate real numbers.
Quantum theory’s prominent use of complex numbers — sums of imaginary and real numbers — was disconcerting to its founders, including physicist Erwin Schrödinger. “From the early days of quantum theory, complex numbers were treated more as a mathematical convenience than a fundamental building block,” says physicist Jingyun Fan of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China.
Some physicists have attempted to build quantum theory using real numbers only, avoiding the imaginary realm with versions called “real quantum mechanics.” But without an experimental test of such theories, the question remained whether imaginary numbers were truly necessary in quantum physics, or just a useful computational tool.
A type of experiment known as a Bell test resolved a different quantum quandary, proving that quantum mechanics really requires strange quantum linkages between particles called entanglement (SN: 8/28/15). “We started thinking about whether an experiment of this sort could also refute real quantum mechanics,” says theoretical physicist Miguel Navascués of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Vienna. He and colleagues laid out a plan for an experiment in a paper posted online at arXiv.org in January 2021 and published December 15 in Nature.
In this plan, researchers would send pairs of entangled particles from two different sources to three different people, named according to conventional physics lingo as Alice, Bob and Charlie. Alice receives one particle, and can measure it using various settings that she chooses. Charlie does the same. Bob receives two particles and performs a special type of measurement to entangle the particles that Alice and Charlie receive. A real quantum theory, with no imaginary numbers, would predict different results than standard quantum physics, allowing the experiment to distinguish which one is correct.
Fan and colleagues performed such an experiment using photons, or particles of light, they report in a paper to be published in Physical Review Letters. By studying how Alice, Charlie and Bob’s results compare across many measurements, Fan, Navascués and colleagues show that the data could be described only by a quantum theory with complex numbers.
Another team of physicists conducted an experiment based on the same concept using a quantum computer made with superconductors, materials which conduct electricity without resistance. Those researchers, too, found that quantum physics requires complex numbers, they report in another paper to be published in Physical Review Letters. “We are curious about why complex numbers are necessary and play a fundamental role in quantum mechanics,” says quantum physicist Chao-Yang Lu of the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, a coauthor of the study.
But the results don’t rule out all theories that eschew imaginary numbers, notes theoretical physicist Jerry Finkelstein of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who was not involved with the new studies. The study eliminated certain theories based on real numbers, namely those that still follow the conventions of quantum mechanics. It’s still possible to explain the results without imaginary numbers by using a theory that breaks standard quantum rules. But those theories run into other conceptual issues, making them “ugly,” he says. But “if you’re willing to put up with the ugliness, then you can have a real quantum theory.”
Despite the caveat, other physicists agree that the quandaries raised by the new findings are compelling. “I find it intriguing when you ask questions about why is quantum mechanics the way it is,” says physicist Krister Shalm of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colo. Asking whether quantum theory could be simpler or if it contains anything unnecessary, “these are very interesting and thought-provoking questions.”";4824;['hoo2rci', 'hooazoc', 'hooe8cb', 'hoovlag', 'hoprp3a', 'hoqhfe5', 'horw1nw', 'hos1wy6', 'hos4gqk', 'hos6a5b', 'hos6fpb', 'hos8fxt', 'hos9q9u', 'hosbs8k', 'hoscyq5', 'hosiun2', 'hoskk1u', 'hosp4eb', 'hosrvup', 'hoswn0w', 'hosx258', 'hotb8zb', 'hotbe0n', 'hotg5ex', 'hothw16', 'hotlg3p', 'hotp0nz', 'hottig1', 'hotvd4a', 'hotyrmr', 'hou298f', 'houdib7', 'houedk6', 'houut3z', 'hov16bv', 'hovg2gr', 'hovwwp4', 'how5clk', 'howlbh7', 'hoykkmz'];209;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.3125;0.46875;0.43928208477013947;0.1599560486508716;12.5;18.75

U.S. officials and scientists unveiled a plan Thursday to pursue what they called one of the most important technological frontiers of the 21st century: building a quantum Internet.
Speaking in Chicago, one of the main hubs of the work, they set goals for forging what they called a second Internet — one that would function alongside the globe’s existing networks, using the laws of quantum mechanics to share information more securely and to connect a new generation of computers and sensors.
Quantum technology seeks to harness the distinct properties of atoms, photons and electrons to build more powerful computers and other tools for processing information. A quantum Internet relies on photons exhibiting a quantum state known as entanglement, which allows them to share information over long distances without having a physical connection.
David Awschalom, a professor at the University of Chicago’s Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory, called the Internet project a pillar of the nation’s quantum-research program.
“It’s the birth of a new technology. It’s becoming a global competition. Every major country on earth has launched a quantum program … because it is becoming clearer and clearer there will be big impacts,” he said in an interview.
The United States’ top technology rival, China, is investing heavily in quantum technology, a field that could transform information processing and confer big economic and national security advantages to countries that dominate it. Europe is also hotly pursuing the research.
The Energy Department and its 17 national labs will form the backbone of the project.
How exactly the work will be funded wasn’t clear. The Energy Department did not announce a funding figure for the project Thursday. Speaking to reporters, Paul Dabbar, the Energy Department’s undersecretary for science, said the federal government invests about $500 to $700 million a year in quantum information technology, suggesting some of that money would fund the new Internet.
In an interview, Dabbar said there would probably be further funding announcements for the project in the future.
Panagiotis Spentzouris, head of quantum science at the Chicago-area Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, or Fermilab, said in an interview that more resources, and a clearer project structure, will be needed to carry out the blueprint published Thursday.
The 38-page document lays out research priorities and milestones to aim for, but it doesn’t assign detailed tasks to particular parties.
Initial users of a quantum Internet could include national security agencies, financial institutions and health-care companies seeking to send data more securely, researchers said.
The networks promise to be more secure — some even say unhackable — because of the nature of photons and other quantum bits, known as qubits. Any attempt to observe or disrupt these particles would automatically alter their state and destroy the information being transmitted, scientists say.
A quantum Internet could also be used to connect various quantum computers with one another, helping boost their total computing power. Quantum computers are still at an early stage of development and not yet as powerful as classical computers, but connecting them via an Internet could help accelerate their use for solving complex problems like finding new pharmaceuticals or new high-tech materials, Awschalom said.
Eventually consumers might also tap into the quantum Internet, to buy products with less risk of their credit card details being hacked, or to send and receive sensitive personal information such as health records or social security numbers, Spentzouris said. It is possible consumers will surf seamlessly between the regular and quantum Internets as they make purchases and send information, without necessarily knowing they are switching platforms, he said.
In a sign of the potential economic rewards that quantum technology could bring, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot both spoke at the announcement Thursday, expressing hope that there would be spillover effects for the city’s tech community.
Universities and labs in the region have established the Chicago Quantum Exchange to try to accelerate innovation and economic development.
Pieces of the network are already up and running at various national labs. In the Chicago area, Argonne National Laboratory has built a 52-mile quantum network that soon will connect to nearby Fermilab, to establish an 80-mile test bed.
In New York, Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Lab have built another 80-mile quantum network.
The plan is to slowly connect these local networks nationwide, using fiber-optic cable, satellites and drones fitted with quantum-communication hardware, Spentzouris said.
A key piece of hardware called a quantum repeater still needs to be developed to amplify a quantum network’s signal over long distances, researcher said.
Awschalom stressed that the country needs to do more to educate a new generation of quantum engineers. “When you ask tech companies what is their number one concern with quantum information technology, the number one concern by far is the workforce,” he said. Companies will ask him, “Where are we going to hire a thousand quantum engineers?”";5475;['fz4ltyx', 'fz4ot4j', 'fz4p5ah', 'fz4qf9c', 'fz4t9gx', 'fz4vh17', 'fz53s5g', 'fz5dr6o', 'fz5ez6b', 'fz5fcjy', 'fz5hq2d', 'fz5jgmq', 'fz5nrpg', 'fz5uai4', 'fz5uc47', 'fz5vjfi', 'fz5wk5m', 'fz5wuq8', 'fz5ypcp', 'fz63lh0', 'fz66cp1', 'fz68njp', 'fz6a3bw', 'fz6h89e', 'fz6jgf3', 'fz6lgzj', 'fz6q81k', 'fz6r0xu', 'fz6tbma', 'fz6tds6', 'fz6y0sx', 'fz6zd67', 'fz702xe', 'fz70bpy', 'fz733t3', 'fz73hzj', 'fz79dct', 'fz7d52x', 'fz7mqmj', 'fz8ej6h'];208;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.75, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0];[0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.375, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0];0.13125;0.24375;0.30097497819586266;0.2996743023684213;5.25;9.75

Astrophysicist at Göttingen University discovers new theoretical hyper-fast soliton solutions
If travel to distant stars within an individual’s lifetime is going to be possible, a means of faster-than-light propulsion will have to be found. To date, even recent research about superluminal (faster-than-light) transport based on Einstein’s theory of general relativity would require vast amounts of hypothetical particles and states of matter that have “exotic” physical properties such as negative energy density. This type of matter either cannot currently be found or cannot be manufactured in viable quantities. In contrast, new research carried out at the University of Göttingen gets around this problem by constructing a new class of hyper-fast ‘solitons’ using sources with only positive energies that can enable travel at any speed. This reignites debate about the possibility of faster-than-light travel based on conventional physics. The research is published in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity.
The author of the paper, Dr Erik Lentz, analysed existing research and discovered gaps in previous ‘warp drive’ studies. Lentz noticed that there existed yet-to-be explored configurations of space-time curvature organized into ‘solitons’ that have the potential to solve the puzzle while being physically viable. A soliton – in this context also informally referred to as a 'warp bubble’ – is a compact wave that maintains its shape and moves at constant velocity. Lentz derived the Einstein equations for unexplored soliton configurations (where the space-time metric’s shift vector components obey a hyperbolic relation), finding that the altered space-time geometries could be formed in a way that worked even with conventional energy sources. In essence, the new method uses the very structure of space and time arranged in a soliton to provide a solution to faster-than-light travel, which – unlike other research – would only need sources with positive energy densities. No “exotic” negative energy densities needed.
If sufficient energy could be generated, the equations used in this research would allow space travel to Proxima Centauri, our nearest star, and back to Earth in years instead of decades or millennia. That means an individual could travel there and back within their lifetime. In comparison, the current rocket technology would take more than 50,000 years for a one-way journey. In addition, the solitons (warp bubbles) were configured to contain a region with minimal tidal forces such that the passing of time inside the soliton matches the time outside: an ideal environment for a spacecraft. This means there would not be the complications of the so-called “twin paradox” whereby one twin travelling near the speed of light would age much more slowly than the other twin who stayed on Earth: in fact, according to the recent equations both twins would be the same age when reunited.
“This work has moved the problem of faster-than-light travel one step away from theoretical research in fundamental physics and closer to engineering. The next step is to figure out how to bring down the astronomical amount of energy needed to within the range of today's technologies, such as a large modern nuclear fission power plant. Then we can talk about building the first prototypes,"" says Lentz.
Currently, the amount of energy required for this new type of space propulsion drive is still immense. Lentz explains, “The energy required for this drive travelling at light speed encompassing a spacecraft of 100 meters in radius is on the order of hundreds of times of the mass of the planet Jupiter. The energy savings would need to be drastic, of approximately 30 orders of magnitude to be in range of modern nuclear fission reactors.” He goes on to say: “Fortunately, several energy-saving mechanisms have been proposed in earlier research that can potentially lower the energy required by nearly 60 orders of magnitude.” Lentz is currently in the early-stages of determining if these methods can be modified, or if new mechanisms are needed to bring the energy required down to what is currently possible.";4213;['gqeddex', 'gqegv3w', 'gqeh7nh', 'gqeitbe', 'gqem9q8', 'gqemwaf', 'gqerpyh', 'gqetzph', 'gqev133', 'gqewmxx', 'gqexdb4', 'gqexmjm', 'gqexnk8', 'gqez9uj', 'gqf1lng', 'gqf3aaa', 'gqf5ggz', 'gqf66xp', 'gqf6c0j', 'gqfbk3p', 'gqfcajr', 'gqff04j', 'gqfko8a', 'gqfq1us', 'gqfqpr7', 'gqft00v', 'gqft8di', 'gqfthi9', 'gqfwevi', 'gqfwmzt', 'gqfwriz', 'gqfxkc8', 'gqg2yoh', 'gqg4jeh', 'gqg74b9', 'gqgadpd', 'gqgbnva', 'gqgk2z0', 'gqgpwhn', 'gqh0y7e'];206;1;[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 0.125, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.625, 0.0, 0.875, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.625];0.33125;0.5375;0.4234807404121231;0.31647472252930403;13.25;21.5

D-Wave’s machines are the closest thing we have today to quantum computing, which works with quantum bits, or qubits — each of which can be zero or one or both — instead of more conventional bits. The superposition of these qubits enable machines to make great numbers of computations simultaneously, making a quantum computer highly desirable for certain types of processes.
In two tests, the Google Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab today announced that it has found the D-Wave machine to be considerably faster than simulated annealing — a simulation of quantum computation on a classical computer chip.
Google director of engineering Hartmut Neven went over the results of the tests in a blog post today:
We found that for problem instances involving nearly 1,000 binary variables, quantum annealing significantly outperforms its classical counterpart, simulated annealing. It is more than 108 times faster than simulated annealing running on a single core. We also compared the quantum hardware to another algorithm called Quantum Monte Carlo. This is a method designed to emulate the behavior of quantum systems, but it runs on conventional processors. While the scaling with size between these two methods is comparable, they are again separated by a large factor sometimes as high as 108.
Google has also published a paper on the findings.
If nothing else, this is a positive signal for venture-backed D-Wave, which has also sold quantum computers to Lockheed Martin and Los Alamos National Laboratory. At an event at NASA Ames today where reporters looked at the D-Wave machine, chief executive Vern Brownell sounded awfully pleased at the discovery. Without question, the number 100,000,000 is impressive. It’s certainly the kind of thing the startup can show when it attempts to woo IT buyers and show why its technology might well succeed in disrupting legacy chipmakers such as Intel.
But Google continues to work with NASA on quantum computing, and meanwhile Google also has its own quantum computing hardware lab. And in that initiative, Google is still in the early days.
“I would say building a quantum computer is really, really hard, so first of all, we’re just trying to get it to work and not worry about cost or size or whatever,” said John Martinis, the person leading up Google’s hardware program and a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Commercial applications of this technology might not happen overnight, but it’s possible that eventually they could lead to speed-ups for things like image recognition, which is in place inside of many Google services. But the tool could also come in handy for a traditional thing like cleaning up dirty data. Outside of Google, quantum speed-ups could translate into improvements for planning and scheduling and air traffic management, said David Bell, director of the Universities Space Research Association’s Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science, which also works on the D-Wave machine at NASA Ames.";3227;['cxsj14d', 'cxsjrrf', 'cxsk561', 'cxskdog', 'cxsktqg', 'cxslfos', 'cxsmwiu', 'cxsodlv', 'cxsof38', 'cxsofdh', 'cxsoqrt', 'cxsp17u', 'cxspoyq', 'cxsqjsl', 'cxsqlgl', 'cxsqn5u', 'cxsqp5a', 'cxsqqc1', 'cxsr17e', 'cxsrr5m', 'cxsslsy', 'cxst6wi', 'cxst9jr', 'cxsuoqz', 'cxsv4kp', 'cxsvz8f', 'cxsxxe8', 'cxsyg9m', 'cxt0xnb', 'cxt1b1n', 'cxt23ll', 'cxt2pp6', 'cxt364d', 'cxt3869', 'cxt4dau', 'cxt4dzn', 'cxta5y0', 'cxtden4', 'cxteish', 'cxtv2fx'];207;1;[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5];[0.875, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.625, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.30625;0.496875;0.4238495458296493;0.2951264294755724;12.25;19.875

One of the oddest predictions of quantum theory – that a system can't change while you're watching it – has been confirmed in an experiment by Cornell physicists. Their work opens the door to a fundamentally new method to control and manipulate the quantum states of atoms and could lead to new kinds of sensors.
The experiments were performed in the Utracold Lab of Mukund Vengalattore, assistant professor of physics, who has established Cornell's first program to study the physics of materials cooled to temperatures as low as .000000001 degree above absolute zero. The work is described in the Oct. 2 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters
Graduate students Yogesh Patil and Srivatsan K. Chakram created and cooled a gas of about a billion Rubidium atoms inside a vacuum chamber and suspended the mass between laser beams. In that state the atoms arrange in an orderly lattice just as they would in a crystalline solid.,But at such low temperatures, the atoms can ""tunnel"" from place to place in the lattice. The famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the position and velocity of a particle interact. Temperature is a measure of a particle's motion. Under extreme cold velocity is almost zero, so there is a lot of flexibility in position; when you observe them, atoms are as likely to be in one place in the lattice as another.
The researchers demonstrated that they were able to suppress quantum tunneling merely by observing the atoms. This so-called ""Quantum Zeno effect"", named for a Greek philosopher, derives from a proposal in 1977 by E. C. George Sudarshan and Baidyanath Misra at the University of Texas, Austin,, who pointed out that the weird nature of quantum measurements allows, in principle, for a quantum system to be ""frozen"" by repeated measurements.
Previous experiments have demonstrated the Zeno Effect with the ""spins"" of subatomic particles. ""This is the first observation of the Quantum Zeno effect by real space measurement of atomic motion,"" Vengalattore said. ""Also, due to the high degree of control we've been able to demonstrate in our experiments, we can gradually 'tune' the manner in which we observe these atoms. Using this tuning, we've also been able to demonstrate an effect called 'emergent classicality' in this quantum system."" Quantum effects fade, and atoms begin to behave as expected under classical physics.
The researchers observed the atoms under a microscope by illuminating them with a separate imaging laser. A light microscope can't see individual atoms, but the imaging laser causes them to fluoresce, and the microscope captured the flashes of light. When the imaging laser was off, or turned on only dimly, the atoms tunneled freely. But as the imaging beam was made brighter and measurements made more frequently, the tunneling reduced dramatically.
""This gives us an unprecedented tool to control a quantum system, perhaps even atom by atom,"" said Patil, lead author of the paper. Atoms in this state are extremely sensitive to outside forces,l he noted, so this work could lead to the development of new kinds of sensors.
The experiments were made possible by the group's invention of a novel imaging technique that made it possible to observe ultracold atoms while leaving them in the same quantum state. ""It took a lot of dedication from these students and it has been amazing to see these experiments be so successful,"" Vengalattore said. ""We now have the unique ability to control quantum dynamics purely by observation.""
The popular press has drawn a parallel of this work with the ""weeping angels"" depicted in the Dr. Who television series – alien creatures who look like statues and can't move as long as you're looking at them.

Researchers announced they are now able to develop a superconducting qubit made from microfabricated silicon that maintains coherence long enough for practical computation. Whoa! That probably sounds like a lot to swallow, so let’s break it down.
Bits and Qubits
Information is measured in ‘bits’, and a bit may have two positions (described typically as 0 or 1). Quantum computers however don’t use these bits, and instead they use quantum bits, or ‘qubits’. But while a bit must be a 0 or a 1, a qubit can be both 0, 1, or a superposition of both. This difference might seem small and subtle, but in fact, it is absolutely humongous: a mere hundred qubits can store more classical ‘bit’ information than there are atoms in the Universe.
Needless to say a computer running on qubits would be game changing, in pretty much the same way microprocessors were in their days. But what makes quantum computing extremely difficult is a problem called ‘decoherence‘. In the quantum world, things don’t happen as they do in the ‘real world’; when a qubit will move from the 0 state to the 1 state or to a superposition, it will decohere to state 0 due to interference from other parts of the computer. Generally speaking, decoherence is the loss order of the phase angles between the components. So in order for quantum computers to be practical and scalable, the system would have to remain coherent for a long enough time to allow error-correction techniques to function properly.
“In 1999, coherence times were about 1 nanosecond,” said IBM scientist Matthias Steffen. “Last year, coherence times were achieved for as long as 1 to 4 microseconds. With these new techniques, we’ve achieved coherence times of 10 to 100 microseconds. We need to improve that by a factor of 10 to 100 before we’re at the threshold we want to be. But considering that in the past ten years we’ve increased coherence times by a factor of 10,000, I’m not scared.”
Two different approaches, one breakthrough
IBM announced they took two different approaches, both of which played a significant part in the breakthrough they revealed. The first one was to build a 3-D qubit made from superconducting, microfabricated silicon. The main advantage here is that the equipment and know-how necessary to create this technology already exists, nothing new has to be invented, thanks to developments made by Yale researchers (for which Steffen expressed a deep admiration). Using this approach, they managed to maintain coherence for 95 microseconds – “But you could round that to 100 for the piece if you want,” Steffen joked.
The second idea involved a traditional 2-D qubit, which IBM’s scientists used to build a “Controlled NOT gate” or CNOT gate, which is a building block of quantum computing. A CNOT gate connects two qubits in such a way that the second qubit will change state if the first qubit changes its state to 1. The CNOT gate was able to produce a coherence of 10 microseconds, which is long enough to show a 95% accuracy rate – a notable improvement from the 81% accuracy rate, the highest achieved until now. Of course, the technology is still years away from being actually on the shelves, but the developments are very impressive.
From quantum to reality
Given the rapid progress that is being made in the field of quantum computing, one can only feel that a quantum computer is looking more and more like a real possibility. As error correction protocols become more accurate and coherence times grow longer, we are moving more and more towards accurate quantum computing – but you shouldn’t expect a quantum smartphone just yet.
“There’s a growing sense that a quantum computer can’t be a laptop or desktop,” said Steffen. “Quantum computers may well just being housed in a large building somewhere. It’s not going to be something that’s very portable. In terms of application, I don’t think that’s a huge detriment because they’ll be able to solve problems so much faster than traditional computers.”
The next steps are simple, in principle, but extremely hard to do in practice. The accuracy rate has to be at at least 99.99%, up to the point where it achieves what is called a ‘logical qubit’ – one that, for practical purposes, doesn’t suffer decoherence. From that point, the only thing left to do is develop the quantum computer architecture, and this will prove troublesome too – but the reward is definitely worth it.

Researchers in Germany have demonstrated quantum entanglement of two atoms separated by 33 km (20.5 miles) of fiber optics. This is a record distance for this kind of communication and marks a breakthrough towards a fast and secure quantum internet.
Quantum entanglement is the uncanny phenomenon where two particles can become so inextricably linked that examining one can tell you about the state of the other. Stranger still, changing something about one particle will instantly alter its partner, no matter how far apart they are. That leads to the unsettling implication that information is being “teleported” faster than the speed of light, an idea that was too much for even Einstein, who famously described it as “spooky action at a distance.”
Despite its apparent impossibility, quantum entanglement has been consistently demonstrated in experiments for decades, with scientists taking advantage of its bizarre nature to quickly transmit data over long distances. And in the new study, researchers from Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (LMU) and Saarland University have now broken a distance record for quantum entanglement between two atoms over fiber optics.
In their experiments, the team entangled two rubidium atoms kept in optical traps in two different buildings on the LMU campus. They were separated by 700 m (2,297 ft) of fiber optics, which was extended out to 33 km with extra spools of cable. Each atom was excited with a laser pulse, which causes it to emit a photon that’s quantum entangled with the atom.
The photons are then sent down the fiber optic cables to meet at a receiving station in the middle. There, the photons undergo a joint measurement, which entangles them – and because they’re each already entangled with their own atom, the two atoms become entangled with each other as well.
While photons have been entangled over great distances before, this study marks a new distance record for entangling two atoms, which could function as “quantum memory” nodes, over fiber optics. The key is that the mediating photons were converted into a longer wavelength so that they travel further through the fibers – their natural wavelength of 780 nanometers (nm) means they’d normally be lost after a few kilometers, so before their journey started the team ran them through a device to convert them to a wavelength of 1,517 nm. This is close to the 1,550-nm wavelength commonly used for telecoms in fiber optics, which reduces losses.
The team says this is an important step on the way to realizing a practical quantum internet. Such communications networks would be much faster and more secure than those in use today and, importantly, this study shows that they can operate using existing fiber optic infrastructure. This could be paired with technologies like satellites, which have previously demonstrated the ability to beam entangled photons over thousands of kilometers.";2982;['ifc334g', 'ifcbn7j', 'ifcd77y', 'ifcemm9', 'ifcfh5y', 'ifch2e3', 'ifcmjpr', 'ifcmjzh', 'ifcmw8m', 'ifcrchd', 'ifcshuj', 'ifcy213', 'ifd1460', 'ifd1m19', 'ifd2xwm', 'ifd53ek', 'ifd55w4', 'ifd5jrg', 'ifd83y1', 'ifd86u9', 'ifdd559', 'ifdoafx', 'ifdp6b0', 'ifdp7jz', 'ifdzkq2', 'ife1wsx', 'ife4jct', 'ife4vq0', 'ife686o', 'ife89cg', 'ife8qa4', 'ifelpcg', 'ifeovsd', 'ifep1ob', 'ifeqdwt', 'ifetz8q', 'ifey9ia', 'iff57un', 'iffzi4d', 'ifg0zw6'];181;1;[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0];[0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.625, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5];0.4375;0.5625;0.460129057982649;0.23551804601770965;17.5;22.5

Speaking to Reuters ahead of its Think conference, Krishna said that the devices that should go up for sale in 2025 will have more than 4,000 qubits of computing power. To put things in perspective, today’s machines have some 127 qubits.
Further explaining what such a device would be capable of doing, Krishna said it would be able to optimize routing truck fleets, or improve financial risk modeling. To tackle these challenges with traditional computer hardware, he says, would require a machine “the size of this planet”.
Treading carefully
Krishna also touched on the topic of over-hyping the company’s Watson AI which, as it turns out, delivered results in healthcare and other industries, a bit slower than what was expected.
Building quantum computers is a more difficult task that developing Artificial Intelligence (AI), he added. ""We might have hyped some things,"" Krishna said. ""This time, we try to tread the line carefully.""
In late January 2022, IBM published a research paper, arguing just how difficult it was to build quantum computing devices. The paper proposes a method for increasing the applications available for quantum power.

""Quantum computers are promising for simulations of chemical and physical systems, but the limited capabilities of today’s quantum processors permit only small, and often approximate, simulations,"" IBM said in the paper.
The solution, the company says, is to combine classical and quantum computing power, a process called ""entanglement forging"". If successful, the system can double the size of the available quantum computations.
Quantum is a nascent technology, albeit one with great potential. In layman’s terms, quantum computing moves beyond binary processing (where everything is either a one or zero) and can allow for states in between those two poles, making the eventual computer more powerful in the process.";2281;['i8sv7e0', 'i8t0xoo', 'i8t2qfm', 'i8t9o35', 'i8tddr9', 'i8tey8i', 'i8ti2of', 'i8tm7rp', 'i8tpo18', 'i8tqbja', 'i8u51hx', 'i8u71op', 'i8u8cyu', 'i8uegfo', 'i8ueska', 'i8ukoqs', 'i8ul3ly', 'i8ulhde', 'i8uq53j', 'i8uwwr1', 'i8v0ov8', 'i8v3pts', 'i8v5oyx', 'i8v7q9c', 'i8v8gvu', 'i8vv7jy', 'i8vy1tp', 'i8wd2rf', 'i8wl8d0', 'i8wslwe', 'i8wty9k', 'i8ww2gw', 'i8wzkau', 'i8x7bqi', 'i8xu7n6', 'i8yadsl', 'i8yqudt', 'i8yyri5', 'i8z9xs5', 'i92770m'];90;1;[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.125, 0.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.125, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5];0.30625;0.284375;0.434768257235967;0.27808988542376006;12.25;11.375

Now, a team of researchers has put together a mathematical model showing aliens could potentially be communicating across space – via quantum physics.
Efforts are well underway to make quantum communications a reality here on Earth. The idea is that quantum mechanics provide certain properties that would make information transfer inherently faster and more secure than regular systems… if we can get it to work.
One of the major hurdles to overcome before quantum networks can be established is that they're very fragile and susceptible to interference. According to this latest study, such networks could fly across space without breaking up.
""Quantum states you generally think of as very delicate, and if there's any kind of external interaction, you kind of destroy that state,"" lead author of the research, theoretical physicist Arjun Berera from the University of Edinburgh in the UK, told Science News.
Berera and his colleague Jaime Calderón-Figueroa, a fellow theoretical physicist at the University of Edinburgh, ran calculations on the movement of X-rays across the emptiness of space to check for potential decoherence (the breaking up of the quantum state).
If photons – particles of light – were used as the quantum particles, the researchers determined, they could be beamed across hundreds of thousands of light-years at least, a greater stretch of distance than the entire Milky Way galaxy.
That's partly because the average density of matter in space is much less than it is on Earth, and this 'cleaner' environment means less chance of interference. Even gravitational pulls wouldn't be enough to knock a quantum communication network off course.
""It is plausible that quantum communication mediated by photons could be established across interstellar distances, in particular for photons in the X-ray region below the electron mass,"" write the researchers in their published paper.
That alien life forms might be using quantum networks to speak to each other or to try and get in touch with us is, of course, pure speculation – but at the same time it gives astronomers another potential sign of life they can monitor for.
The ""considerable information transfer"" possible with a quantum signal would make it attractive to any extraterrestrial intelligence out there in the cosmos, the researchers say, though it may require a fully functioning quantum computer in order to decode it.
And even quantum communication isn't magic: Information still can't travel faster than the speed of light, so transmissions may take several years to reach their destinations.
Based on these findings, we can now add quantum communication as well as classical communication to the possible ways aliens might be chatting with each other – or perhaps might be trying to make themselves known to us.

Faster than light, 10,000 times faster.
That's what a team of physicists led by Juan Yin at the University of Science and Technology of China in Shanghai found in an experiment involving entangled photons, or photons that remain intimately connected, even when separated by vast distances.They wanted to see what would happen if you tried assigning a speed to what Einstein called ""spooky action at a distance.""
They didn't find anything unexpected, but that wasn't the point: in physics, sometimes it's good to be sure. The group published their work on the ArXiv.org, a preprint server for physics papers.
All tangled up
Quantum physicists have long known that after two particles — photons, for example — interact, they sometimes become ""entangled."" This kind of experiment has been repeated many times, and involves taking two entangled photons and sending them to different places. Perhaps photon A goes to Los Angeles and photon B goes to Boston.
When photon A is observed, it has a certain polarization, perhaps ""up."" The other photon in Boston is always in the opposite polarization, ""down."" No matter what measurement is made of photon A, photon B will always be opposite. It is impossible to tell what the polarization will be before you measure it, but the entangled photons always seem to ""know"" the right state to be in, instantaneously. [Twisted Physics: 7 Mind-Blowing Findings]
As Chad Orzel, assistant professor of physics at Union College, explained, ""It's as though you sent two cards to two different addresses. One might be the jack of diamonds and the other the ace of hearts. When you get the card at one address you know which one went to the other. Quantum mechanics is weird because until you open the envelope, saying which card it is doesn't have any meaning; it could be either one.""
Speed of quantum interaction
This is what Albert Einstein called ""spooky action at a distance."" And the correlation between the photons' states seems to happen instantaneously. But what does ""instantaneous"" really mean? That's part of what the Chinese team wanted to look at.
So the researchers entangled two photons and sent them to two different stations about 10 miles (16 kilometers) apart. In their ArXiv paper, the scientists said that previous experiments had ""locality loopholes,"" which is another way of saying that it's possible to explain the link between photons with something other than the ""action at a distance.""
The group measured the state of one photon and timed how long the entangled state took to show up in the other. They found that the slowest possible speed for quantum interactions is 10,000 times the speed of light — assuming your experiment is moving relatively slowly, at least relative to light beams.
Whereas the result may sound like a way to send faster-than-light messages, it isn't, really, because you can't know the state of the entangled photon pair before it's measured; so there's no way to control it and make the photon at the other end take on certain states and use it like a Morse code telegraph. [10 Implications of Faster-Than-Light Travel]
This type of experiment has been done before, notably by a European team, in 2008. So why do it again? Many physics experiments are performed to check more closely the values of constants used in equations, for instance, which enable more precise measurements in other areas.
Orzel said that even if it turned out that there was some small amount of time it takes for the state of a photon to change (meaning it's not instantaneous), it isn't clear that lag would mean much for quantum physics generally. That's because there are several interpretations for why quantum phenomena happen the way they do, and all explain the experimental results equally well. Physicists aren't even certain that there's an experiment one could do to tell the difference.
He added that it is extremely unlikely that anyone will ever get an ""exact"" value for the speed of such quantum interactions, and, in fact, modern physics prohibits that kind of finding in principle. But it is useful to see what the limits are — to clarify what we mean when we say ""instantaneous.""
""There's a certain strain of physics that people that will say it has to be instantaneous – in fact, if it is faster than light it mustbe instantaneous,"" Orzel said. ""So if you can put a limit on it that is kind of cool.""";4433;['c9577bm', 'c9579nt', 'c957asb', 'c957b6c', 'c957dj0', 'c957ey0', 'c957ltx', 'c957o91', 'c957opn', 'c957orl', 'c957zgo', 'c9580rj', 'c95839m', 'c958b1l', 'c958lvq', 'c958q16', 'c958tmw', 'c958to5', 'c959or3', 'c95a3vj', 'c95aq9g', 'c95bk7o', 'c95bmlk', 'c95bpk5', 'c95bry0', 'c95c248', 'c95c2n6', 'c95c9v2', 'c95czex', 'c95dnwb', 'c95drcu', 'c95dvu3', 'c95e7bv', 'c95ew9g', 'c95gx6r', 'c95h0qd', 'c95i24s', 'c95kco3', 'c95kmfh', 'c95l3w3'];178;1;[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0];[0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.125, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5];0.70625;0.453125;0.439770892056307;0.2967104807299533;28.25;18.125

He’s leader of the Google research group working on building astonishingly powerful computer chips that manipulate data using the quirks of quantum physics. By the end of this year, Martinis says, his team will build a device that achieves “quantum supremacy,” meaning it can perform a particular calculation that’s beyond the reach of any conventional computer. Proof will come from a kind of drag race between Google’s chip and one of the world’s largest supercomputers.
“We think we’re ready to do this experiment. It’s something we can do now,” says Martinis.
One reason for his confidence is that Google’s roughly 25-strong group has made a new quantum chip that tests out key design features needed to make a device for that head-to-head contest.
Quantum chips represent digital bits of data using qubits, devices that can shortcut through some tough calculations by exploiting the counterintuitive physics of quantum mechanics. Researchers have so far demonstrated quantum computing with only small groups of qubits, though. Google has released results from a chip that has nine qubits arranged in a line, but Martinis says he’ll need a grid of 49 qubits for his quantum supremacy experiment.
Google’s latest chip has only six qubits, but they are arranged in a two-by-three configuration that Martinis says shows the company’s technology still works when qubits are nestled side by side, as they will be in larger devices.
The six-qubit chip is also a test of a manufacturing method in which the qubits and the conventional wiring that controls them are made on separate chips later “bump bonded” together. That approach, a major focus of Google’s team since it was established just over two years ago, is intended to eliminate the extra control lines needed in a larger chip, which can interfere with how qubits function.
“That process is all working,” says Martinis. “Now we’re ready to kind of move fast.” Designs for devices with 30 to 50 qubits are already in progress, he says. He briefly flashed up images of the six-qubit chip at the recent IEEE TechIgnite conference in Burlingame, California, but his group has yet to formally disclose technical details.
Martinis joined Google in late 2014 from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he remains a professor today (see “Google Launches Effort to Build Its Own Quantum Computer”). His team is one of several industrial research groups recently formed or expanded thanks to growing signs that the technology behind quantum computing is becoming more tractable. The race to develop quantum processors includes Intel, Microsoft, IBM, and even startups (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2017: Practical Quantum Computers”).
Simon Gustavsson, a principal investigator in a quantum computing research group at MIT, says that Google is one of the leaders. “It’s pretty comparable between Google and IBM,” he says.
Pulling off its quantum supremacy experiment this year would underline the search company’s competitiveness, although quantum processors would need to be much larger than 50 qubits to be capable of useful work.
“It’ll be an academic milestone,” says Chris Monroe, a professor at the University of Maryland and cofounder of the quantum computing startup IonQ. “Afterward you still have to figure out how to make it more scalable and programmable.”
Martinis agrees that much will remain to be done, but he argues that the experiment could become a benchmark for anyone claiming to have a working quantum computer.
He also says the target has helped managers at Google, and the company’s cofounder Sergey Brin, appreciate that the technology is becoming real. “They all get it and are very excited about it,” says Martinis. “We’re trying to get support within Google, and this experiment has been very good to get other engineers talking to us.”

Details of the crystal, which is made up of just 300 atoms, are published today in the journal Nature.
""Quantum computing is a kind of information science that is based on the notion that if one performs computations in a fundamentally different way than the way your classical desktop computer works,"" says study co-author University of Sydney's Dr Michael Biercuk.
""There's a huge potential to solve a variety of problems that are very, very hard or near impossible for standard computer.""
The crystal simulator uses a property of quantum mechanics called superposition, where a quantum particle appears to be in two distinct states at the same time. This means the particle, known as a qubit, can be used to solve two equations simultaneously.
As the number of qubits increase, the number or states increases exponentially. For example, 2 qubits can simultaneously be in 4 states, 3 qubits in 8 states: 2 to the power of n states for n qubits.
Outstrips classical computers
According to Biercuk, the computing power of the 300-atom crystal simulator far outstrips the capacity of today's classical computer.
""It turns out that that computer would need to be the size of the known universe - which is clearly something that's not possible to achieve,"" he says.
Experts believe quantum computing is moving to a stage where it is so far out in front and performing such complex tasks it will be difficult to check if it is working accurately.
""They're not easily checked by a classical computer which opens a whole variety of problems,"" says Biercuk.
And he adds that there is still plenty of work to be done before quantum computers start appearing on desks in homes and offices.
""The central element is something like a millimetre in diameter, 300 atoms that are suspended in space,"" says Biercuk.

Are you suffering from a severely polarized society and a fast-growing population living below the poverty line? Well, I have the laser to solve all your problems.
OK, maybe not. But when it comes to quantum computing, I believe that lasers are the future. I suspect that the current architectures are akin to the Colossus or the ENIAC: they are breakthroughs in their own right, but they are not the future. My admittedly biased opinion is that the future is optical. A new paper provides my opinion some support, demonstrating solutions to a mind-boggling 1030 problem space using a quantum optical system. Unfortunately, the support is a little more limited than I'd like, as it is a rather limited breakthrough.
Photons flipping coins
The researchers have demonstrated something called a Gaussian boson sampling system. This is essentially a device designed to solve a single type of problem. It's based on devices called ""beam splitters,"" so let's start with a closer look at how those work.
If you shine light on a mirror that is 50 percent reflective, called a beam splitter, then half the light will be transmitted and half reflected. If the light intensity is low enough that only a single photon is present, it is either reflected or transmitted with the same randomness as a fair coin toss. This is the idea behind a beam splitter, which can take an incoming stream of photons from a laser beam and divide it into two beams traveling in different directions.
A beam splitter at 45 degrees can be thought of as a four-port device (see picture). In that picture, you can see that if two identical photons are incident on the same beam splitter from two different ports, then the result is not entirely random. They will both exit the same port, though which port they exit is random.
These two simple ideas, along with the idea of entanglement, result in a specific type of universal quantum computer, called a linear optical quantum computer. It's basically a big network of beam splitters. Photons solve a problem by the way they spread through the network, which is determined based on where they exit.
Entanglement comes in the form of the path taken by the photons. Until and unless we measure that path, we cannot know its details, so we have to consider that all photons take all possible paths. Under these circumstances, if two photons arrive at a beam splitter at the same time via different ports, then their paths will become linked (entangled). Build a big-enough network of beam splitters and this can happen many times, creating sprawling entangled states.
Flipping entangled photonic coins
The number of output states scales very quickly with the number of inputs and beam splitters. In the current demonstration, the researchers used 50 inputs and—the exact type of device is not described—a chip with the equivalent of 300 beam splitters. The total number of possible output states is about 1030, which is about 14 orders of magnitude greater than the next biggest demonstration of quantum computing.
Photons are sent into the network (one at each input) and exit in a state that is randomly chosen from all possible states. In less than four minutes, the researchers had obtained results that they estimate would take a fast classical computer about 2.5 billion years to calculate.
This was followed by careful tests to check that the behavior was indeed quantum. Now, of course, computing the exact output for a full input is impossible. But it is possible to calculate what would happen given specific input states and compare the output states with the results of those calculation. It is also possible to calculate the output of the network if the light is not in a quantum state or if the photons are not identical. In the first case, the measurement results match the predictions, and in the second two cases, the measurement results don’t match the predictions. This provides strong evidence for the result being due to quantum effects.
Flipping useless
In many respects, this is a fantastic result. I don’t think anyone can very easily argue that the researchers have not demonstrated a quantum speed-up. It is also an incredible engineering achievement. One laser provides 25 equal-intensity beams, each carefully aligned to two crystals that each generate single photons. These are then carefully aligned to optical fibers, the outputs of which have to be carefully coupled to the chip that houses the beam splitters. The outputs need to be carefully aligned to photodetectors. The whole setup, which probably occupies an area of about 1.5m x 2.5m, has to be carefully stabilized to high precision (about 10nm). No doubt there are several super-proud PhD students who did all of that painstaking work.
On the other hand, the work is no different to other quantum-advantage experiments: take a problem that is mostly useless but happens to map exactly to the architecture of your computer. Naturally, the computer can solve it. But the point of a computer—and this is why the researchers do not refer to the device as a computer—is to solve many different useful problems. And for these cases, we have not yet seen undisputed evidence of the promised quantum advantage. I have no doubt that it will come, though.
Light is enlightening
Even though this work is not as overwhelmingly positive as it first seems, I still think optical quantum computers are the way to go.
At the moment, practical quantum computers come in only two flavors. The licorice-flavored variety consists of a string of ions (an atom with an electron removed) that are all lined up like a string of pearls. The ions are far enough apart that they can be separately addressed, which means that information (in the form of quantum bits, called qubits) can be stored and read from individual atoms. Computation operations can be performed using microwaves and by using the motion of the ions. Here, each bit is highly reliable, but performing complex computation is a rather difficult and stately dance of microwave pulses and laser pulses.
The lemon sherbet of quantum computers are the liquid-helium-cooled superconducting rings. Each ring represents a qubit, which are addressed and coupled to each other via wires. The advantage of this approach is that the hardware is relatively easy to scale—it’s basically the same skill as making printed circuit boards. But the quantum behavior of each qubit is much easier to disrupt, so your board is unlikely to work. You compensate for the reliability problem by repeating the computation many times and looking for the most common answer.
Neither option is particularly attractive in any context other than quantum computing as a service.
Size and temperature
Unlike both of these options, an optical quantum computer could be a (large) chip-scale device that is powered by an array of laser diodes, with readout done by a series of single-photon detectors. None of these require ultralow temperatures or vacuum (if photon-counting detectors are required, liquid nitrogen would be required). Optical quantum computing will require temperature stability and, as this paper demonstrates, a rather complicated feedback system to ensure that the lasers are working exactly as required. However, all of that could be contained in one large rack-mounted box. And that is, for me, the critical advantage of optical systems.

Both data fidelity and transfer distance are crucial when it comes to building a real, working quantum internet, and making progress in either of these areas is cause for celebration for those building our next-generation communications network.
In this case the team achieved a greater than 90 percent fidelity (data accuracy) level with its quantum information, as well as sending it across extensive fibre optic networks similar to those that form the backbone of our existing internet.
""We're thrilled by these results,"" says physicist Panagiotis Spentzouris, from the Fermilab particle physics and accelerator laboratory based at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).
""This is a key achievement on the way to building a technology that will redefine how we conduct global communication.""
Quantum internet technology uses qubits; unmeasured particles that remain suspended in a mix of possible states like spinning dice yet to settle.
Qubits that are introduced to one another have their identities 'entangled' in ways that become obvious once they're finally measured. Imagine these entangled qubits as a pair of dice - while each can land on any number, they are both guaranteed to add to seven no matter how far apart they are. Data in one location instantly reflects data in another.
By clever arrangement of entangling three qubits, it's possible to force the state of one particle to adopt the 'dice roll' of another via their mutually entangled partner. In quantum land, this is as good as turning one particle into another, teleporting its identity across a distance in a blink.
The unstable, delicate nature of quantum information makes it tricky to beam entangled photons over long distances without interference, however. Longer optical fibres simply mean more opportunity for noise to interfere with the entangled states.
In total, the lengths of fibre used to channel each cubit added to 44 kilometres, setting a new limit to how far we can send entangled qubits and still successfully use them to teleport quantum information.
It's never before been demonstrated to work over such a long distance with such accuracy, and it brings a city-sized quantum network closer to reality – even though there are still years of work ahead to make that possible.
""With this demonstration we're beginning to lay the foundation for the construction of a Chicago-area metropolitan quantum network,"" says Spentzouris.
Quantum entanglement and data teleportation is a complex science, and not even the experts fully understand how it might ultimately be used in a quantum network. Each proof of concept like this that we get puts us a little closer to making such a network happen though.
As well as promising huge boosts in speed and computational power, a quantum internet would be ultra-secure – any hacking attempt would be as good as destroying the lock being picked. For now at least, scientists think quantum internet networks will act as specialist extensions to the classical internet, rather than a complete replacement.
Researchers are tackling quantum internet problems from all different angles, which is why you'll see a variety of distances mentioned in studies – they're not all measuring the same technology, using the same equipment, to test the same standards.
What makes this study special is the accuracy and the distance of the quantum entanglement teleportation, as well as the 'off the shelf' equipment used – it should theoretically be relatively easy to scale up this technology using the hardware we're already got in place.
""We are very proud to have achieved this milestone on sustainable, high-performing and scalable quantum teleportation systems,"" says physicist Maria Spiropulu, from Caltech.

News of the paper leaked via a Nasa website last month, detailing that Google had achieved so-called 'quantum supremacy', which happens when a quantum computer can solve problems that would take a classical computer too long to be considered practical.
IBM this week challenged Google's claim that it had achieved quantum supremacy, because the ad giant's researchers failed to account for ""plentiful disk storage"" and other assets on a classical computer. Rather than 10,000 years, IBM researchers claim Google's challenge would take a classical computer just two and half days.
""Because the original meaning of the term ""quantum supremacy,"" as proposed by John Preskill in 2012, was to describe the point where quantum computers can do things that classical computers can't, this threshold has not been met,"" IBM researchers wrote.
""Google's experiment is an excellent demonstration of the progress in superconducting-based quantum computing, showing state-of-the-art gate fidelities on a 53-qubit device, but it should not be viewed as proof that quantum computers are 'supreme' over classical computers,"" the IBMers said.
Nonetheless, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has heralded Google's work as a ""big breakthrough in quantum computing known as quantum supremacy"".
The allure of quantum computing is that a qubit can be both a 0 and 1 simultaneously thanks to the quantum property called superposition.
So, instead of just a 1 and 0 in classical computers, the 1 and 0 can on a quantum computer be in four possible states at any time. A quantum computer with 54 qubits can have 2^54 computational states and since it can scale exponentially, it holds the possibility for computers to one day solve much more complex challenges.
""It's comprised of a two-dimensional grid where each qubit is connected to four other qubits. As a consequence, the chip has enough connectivity that the qubit states quickly interact throughout the entire processor, making the overall state impossible to emulate efficiently with a classical computer,"" the Google researchers explain.
The quantum supremacy experiment was enabled by its improved two-bit gates, which are the foundation of quantum circuits and serve the same function as logic gates in classical computers. Google showed it could achieve record performance even when operating many gates simultaneously.
""We achieved this performance using a new type of control knob that is able to turn off interactions between neighboring qubits. This greatly reduces the errors in such a multi-connected qubit system. We made further performance gains by optimizing the chip design to lower crosstalk, and by developing new control calibrations that avoid qubit defects.""
As noted in a Nature report on the research, Google's supremacy demonstration was carried out by ""sampling solutions"" on a circuit implemented on Sycamore. The results were then compared with simulations performed on classical supercomputers, including the huge Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.
Google says in the future it will make its ""supremacy-class"" processors available to collaborators, academic researchers and companies that want to develop algorithms and applications for today's quantum processors.
The group is also racing to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer that they believe can be used to design new materials, such as lightweight batteries for cars and airplanes, better fertilizers and more effective medicines.

The most rigorous test of quantum theory ever carried out has confirmed that the ‘spooky action at a distance’ that the German physicist famously hated — in which manipulating one object instantaneously seems to affect another, far away one — is an inherent part of the quantum world.
The experiment, performed in the Netherlands, could be the final nail in the coffin for models of the atomic world that are more intuitive than standard quantum mechanics, say some physicists. It could also enable quantum engineers to develop a new suite of ultrasecure cryptographic devices.
“From a fundamental point of view, this is truly history-making,” says Nicolas Gisin, a quantum physicist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland.
Einstein’s annoyance
In quantum mechanics, objects can be in multiple states simultaneously: for example, an atom can be in two places, or spin in opposite directions, at once. Measuring an object forces it to snap into a well-defined state. Furthermore, the properties of different objects can become ‘entangled’, meaning that their states are linked: when a property of one such object is measured, the properties of all its entangled twins become set, too.
This idea galled Einstein because it seemed that this ghostly influence would be transmitted instantaneously between even vastly separated but entangled particles — implying that it could contravene the universal rule that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. He proposed that quantum particles do have set properties before they are measured, called hidden variables. And even though those variable cannot be access, he suggested that they pre-program entangled particles to behave in correlated ways.
In the 1960s, Irish physicist John Bell proposed a test that could discriminate between Einstein’s hidden variables and the spooky interpretation of quantum mechanics. He calculated that hidden variables can explain correlations only up to some maximum limit. If that level is exceeded, then Einstein’s model must be wrong.
The first Bell test was carried out in 1981, by Alain Aspect’s team at the Institute of Optics in Palaiseau, France. Many more have been performed since, always coming down on the side of spookiness — but each of those experiments has had loopholes that meant that physicists have never been able to fully close the door on Einstein’s view. Experiments that use entangled photons are prone to the ‘detection loophole’: not all photons produced in the experiment are detected, and sometimes as many as 80% are lost. Experimenters therefore have to assume that the properties of the photons they capture are representative of the entire set.
To get around the detection loophole, physicists often use particles that are easier to keep track of than photons, such as atoms. But it is tough to separate distant atoms apart without destroying their entanglement. This opens the ‘communication loophole’: if the entangled atoms are too close together, then, in principle, measurements made on one could affect the other without violating the speed-of-light limit.
Entanglement swapping
In the latest paper, which was submitted to the arXiv preprint repository on August 24 and has not yet been peer reviewed, a team led by Ronald Hanson of Delft University of Technology reports the first Bell experiment that closes both the detection and the communication loopholes. The team used a cunning technique called entanglement swapping to combine the benefits of using both light and matter. The researchers started with two unentangled electrons sitting in diamond crystals held in different labs on the Delft campus, 1.3 kilometers apart. Each electron was individually entangled with a photon, and both of those photons were then zipped to a third location. There, the two photons were entangled with each other — and this caused both their partner electrons to become entangled, too.
This did not work every time. In total, the team managed to generate 245 entangled pairs of electrons over the course of nine days. The team's measurements exceeded Bell’s bound, once again supporting the standard quantum view. Moreover, the experiment closed both loopholes at once: because the electrons were easy to monitor, the detection loophole was not an issue, and they were separated far enough apart to close the communication loophole, too.
“It is a truly ingenious and beautiful experiment,” says Anton Zeilinger, a physicist at the Vienna Centre for Quantum Science and Technology.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next few years we see one of the authors of this paper, along with some of the older experiments, Aspect’s and others, named on a Nobel prize,” says Matthew Leifer, a quantum physicist at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo for Theoretical Physics, Ontario. “It’s that exciting.”
A loophole-free Bell test also has crucial implications for quantum cryptography, says Leifer. Companies already sell systems that use quantum mechanics to block eavesdroppers. The systems produce entangled pairs of photons, sending one photon in each pair to the first user and the other photon to the second user. The two users then turn these photons into a cryptographic key that only they know. Because observing a quantum system disrupts its properties, if someone tries to eavesdrop on this process it will produce a noticeable effect, setting off an alarm.
The final chink
But loopholes, and the detection loophole in particular, leave the door open to sophisticated eavesdroppers. Through this loophole, malicious companies could sell devices that fool users into thinking that they are getting quantum-entangled particles, while they are instead being given keys that the company can use to spy on them. In 1991, quantum physicist Artur Ekert observed that integrating a Bell test into the cryptographic system also would ensure that the system uses a genuine quantum process. For this to be valid, however, the Bell test must be free of any loopholes that a hacker could exploit. The Delft experiment “is the final proof that quantum cryptography can be unconditionally secure”, Zeilinger says.
In practice, however, the entanglement-swapping idea will be hard to implement. The team took more than week to generate a few hundred entangled electron pairs, whereas generating a quantum key would require thousands of bits to be processed per minute, points out Gisin, who is a co-founder of the quantum cryptographic company ID Quantique in Geneva.
Zeilinger also notes that there remains one last, somewhat philosophical loophole, first identified by Bell himself: the possibility that hidden variables could somehow manipulate the experimenters’ choices of what properties to measure, tricking them into thinking quantum theory is correct.
Leifer is less troubled by this ‘freedom-of-choice loophole’, however. “It could be that there is some kind of superdeterminism, so that the choice of measurement settings was determined at the Big Bang,” he says. “We can never prove that is not the case, so I think it’s fair to say that most physicists don’t worry too much about this.”";7164;['cujf3aw', 'cujgspm', 'cujh5mu', 'cujhao7', 'cujiic2', 'cujiv25', 'cujixqi', 'cujjgr6', 'cujjpoy', 'cujk0gu', 'cujk390', 'cujk43k', 'cujk5c4', 'cujkc4j', 'cujko12', 'cujky29', 'cujl16i', 'cujl21s', 'cujle6d', 'cujlgez', 'cujljnw', 'cujlusx', 'cujm2yi', 'cujm8r2', 'cujm9nj', 'cujmd91', 'cujmfb0', 'cujn6z2', 'cujnmop', 'cujnvqg', 'cujo36k', 'cujogje', 'cujopa4', 'cujoqps', 'cujpj8b', 'cujpkmh', 'cuju6ez', 'cujyb9q', 'cujymtl', 'cuk1r8r'];151;1;[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];[0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.375, 0.25, 0.5, 0.625, 0.0, 0.5, 0.875, 1.0, 0.0, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.55;0.496875;0.475;0.26292747930750787;22.0;19.875

The phase has the benefits of two time dimensions despite there still being only one singular flow of time, the physicists report July 20 in Nature.
This mind-bending property offers a sought-after benefit: Information stored in the phase is far more protected against errors than with alternative setups currently used in quantum computers. As a result, the information can exist without getting garbled for much longer, an important milestone for making quantum computing viable, says study lead author Philipp Dumitrescu.
The approach’s use of an “extra” time dimension “is a completely different way of thinking about phases of matter,” says Dumitrescu, who worked on the project as a research fellow at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Quantum Physics in New York City. “I’ve been working on these theory ideas for over five years, and seeing them come actually to be realized in experiments is exciting.”
Dumitrescu spearheaded the study’s theoretical component with Andrew Potter of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Romain Vasseur of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Ajesh Kumar of the University of Texas at Austin. The experiments were carried out on a quantum computer at Quantinuum in Broomfield, Colorado, by a team led by Brian Neyenhuis.
The workhorses of the team’s quantum computer are 10 atomic ions of an element called ytterbium. Each ion is individually held and controlled by electric fields produced by an ion trap, and can be manipulated or measured using laser pulses.
Each of those atomic ions serves as what scientists dub a quantum bit, or ‘qubit.’ Whereas traditional computers quantify information in bits (each representing a 0 or a 1), the qubits used by quantum computers leverage the strangeness of quantum mechanics to store even more information. Just as Schrödinger’s cat is both dead and alive in its box, a qubit can be a 0, a 1 or a mashup — or ‘superposition’ — of both. That extra information density and the way qubits interact with one another promise to allow quantum computers to tackle computational problems far beyond the reach of conventional computers.
There’s a big problem, though: Just as peeking in Schrödinger’s box seals the cat’s fate, so does interacting with a qubit. And that interaction doesn’t even have to be deliberate. “Even if you keep all the atoms under tight control, they can lose their quantumness by talking to their environment, heating up or interacting with things in ways you didn’t plan,” Dumitrescu says. “In practice, experimental devices have many sources of error that can degrade coherence after just a few laser pulses.”
The challenge, therefore, is to make qubits more robust. To do that, physicists can use ‘symmetries,’ essentially properties that hold up to change. (A snowflake, for instance, has rotational symmetry because it looks the same when rotated by 60 degrees.) One method is adding time symmetry by blasting the atoms with rhythmic laser pulses. This approach helps, but Dumitrescu and his collaborators wondered if they could go further. So instead of just one time symmetry, they aimed to add two by using ordered but non-repeating laser pulses.
The best way to understand their approach is by considering something else ordered yet non-repeating: ‘quasicrystals.’ A typical crystal has a regular, repeating structure, like the hexagons in a honeycomb. A quasicrystal still has order, but its patterns never repeat. (Penrose tiling is one example of this.) Even more mind-boggling is that quasicrystals are crystals from higher dimensions projected, or squished down, into lower dimensions. Those higher dimensions can even be beyond physical space’s three dimensions: A 2-D Penrose tiling, for instance, is a projected slice of a 5-D lattice.
For the qubits, Dumitrescu, Vasseur and Potter proposed in 2018 the creation of a quasicrystal in time rather than space. Whereas a periodic laser pulse would alternate (A, B, A, B, A, B, etc.), the researchers created a quasi-periodic laser-pulse regimen based on the Fibonacci sequence. In such a sequence, each part of the sequence is the sum of the two previous parts (A, AB, ABA, ABAAB, ABAABABA, etc.). This arrangement, just like a quasicrystal, is ordered without repeating. And, akin to a quasicrystal, it’s a 2D pattern squashed into a single dimension. That dimensional flattening theoretically results in two time symmetries instead of just one: The system essentially gets a bonus symmetry from a nonexistent extra time dimension.
Actual quantum computers are incredibly complex experimental systems, though, so whether the benefits promised by the theory would endure in real-world qubits remained unproven.
Using Quantinuum’s quantum computer, the experientialists put the theory to the test. They pulsed laser light at the computer’s qubits both periodically and using the sequence based on the Fibonacci numbers. The focus was on the qubits at either end of the 10-atom lineup; that’s where the researchers expected to see the new phase of matter experiencing two time symmetries at once. In the periodic test, the edge qubits stayed quantum for around 1.5 seconds — already an impressive length given that the qubits were interacting strongly with one another. With the quasi-periodic pattern, the qubits stayed quantum for the entire length of the experiment, about 5.5 seconds. That’s because the extra time symmetry provided more protection, Dumitrescu says.
“With this quasi-periodic sequence, there’s a complicated evolution that cancels out all the errors that live on the edge,” he says. “Because of that, the edge stays quantum-mechanically coherent much, much longer than you’d expect.”
Though the findings demonstrate that the new phase of matter can act as long-term quantum information storage, the researchers still need to functionally integrate the phase with the computational side of quantum computing. “We have this direct, tantalizing application, but we need to find a way to hook it into the calculations,” Dumitrescu says. “That’s an open problem we’re working on.”";6273;['itdcmtn', 'itdqptx', 'itdupdk', 'itdwxou', 'itdwyxj', 'ite0q58', 'ite8byr', 'iteaf2q', 'iteix6e', 'itelin0', 'item5ye', 'iten23v', 'itenmht', 'itevaym', 'itf1fva', 'itf5j75', 'itfdz7l', 'itfketr', 'itfqgnu', 'itfz6jz', 'itg5e6p', 'itgerwp', 'itgew99', 'itgzk30', 'ith1qmz', 'ithfv2b', 'ivzns5l', 'ivzq0ma', 'ivzqxsn', 'iw00kno', 'iw0ojbz', 'iw0s1di', 'iw144eo', 'iw17dp7', 'iw18x3n', 'iw1qzp1', 'iw2emk8', 'iw2eqbp', 'iw2i5zj', 'iw2un6n'];146;1;[0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.375, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.2875;0.45;0.4128786141228436;0.23684119151870522;11.5;18.0

Knowing you've got yourself an authentic time crystal takes more than a keen eye for high-quality gems.
In a new study, an international team of researchers used Google's Sycamore quantum computing hardware to double-check their theoretical vision of a time crystal, confirming it ticks all of the right boxes for an emerging form of technology we're still getting our head around.
Similar to conventional crystals made of endlessly repeating units of atoms, a time crystal is an infinitely repeating change in a system, one that remarkably doesn't require energy to enter or leave.
Though such a thing comes close to breaking certain laws of thermodynamics, the fact that the system's entropy doesn't increase means it should sit on the right side of physics.
In reality, such a crystal might look like an oscillation of some sort that doesn't synchronize with the rest of the system's rhythms. A laser tapping out a steady beat on your time crystal, for example, might make its particles' spins flip only on every other tap.
But the sheer complexity of a huge number of interacting quantum objects all swinging to their own rhythm leaves some wiggle room for explanations that aren't necessarily dependent on the same rules that underpin time crystal physics.
So while unlikely, we can't rule out that a system that initially looks like a time crystal might in reality warm up over the eons and eventually fall into disarray.
You could just sit and watch your crystal hum away until the eventual heat death of the Universe, of course. Or you could let a quantum computer carry out the job for you.
""The big picture is that we are taking the devices that are meant to be the quantum computers of the future and thinking of them as complex quantum systems in their own right,"" says Stanford University physicist Matteo Ippoliti.
""Instead of computation, we're putting the computer to work as a new experimental platform to realize and detect new phases of matter.""
The starting place for this particular time crystal was a surprisingly unintentional one, emerging from work conducted by Stanford theoretical physicist Vedika Khemani on non-equilibrium physics.
We're intimately familiar with the consequences of this kind of physics in everyday life. Leave your hot cup of coffee out on the bench for half an hour, and you'll discover how quickly its heat energy dissipates as it sits out of equilibrium with its environment.
Khemani and her colleagues were more interested in the imbalance of energy on the far less intuitive level of quantum physics.
It was only when a reviewer of Khemani's research drew her attention to similarities between her own work and time crystals that she turned her focus to this exciting new field of physics.
""Time-crystals are a striking example of a new type of non-equilibrium quantum phase of matter,"" says Khemani.
""While much of our understanding of condensed matter physics is based on equilibrium systems, these new quantum devices are providing us a fascinating window into new non-equilibrium regimes in many-body physics.""
Modelling their time crystal on Google's quantum technology allowed the team to look for signs of infinite repetition within just a few hundred kicks of a laser pulse. They could also run the simulation backwards and scale its size.
""It essentially told us how to correct for its own errors, so that the fingerprint of ideal time-crystalline behavior could be ascertained from finite time observations,"" says Roderich Moessner, a theoretical physicist from the Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems in Germany.
Having ways to model actual time crystals with confidence that they represent a truly unique phase of matter could be invaluable for probing the insane complexities of non-equilibrium quantum physics.
Time crystals promise to be a window into the novel ways that a wide range of complex systems operate, providing insights not just into quantum spaces, but systems as complex as our own brains.
One day a lot of scientists across a range of fields will be in the market for a time crystal.

A team led by Dr. Eunjoo Jang, a Samsung fellow, and Dr. Yu-Ho Won, a principal researcher at Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, improved the structure of the quantum dot made out of environmentally-friendly indium phosphide.
Their proposed structure prevents oxidation of the core and builds a symmetrical and thick shell around it to prevent energy leaks. The ligand on the shell surface has also been made shorter to allow it to absorb electric current faster.
Quantum efficiency improves by 21.4% and the lifetime of the diodes increased to a million hours, the South Korean tech giant said.
The company added that it has over 170 patents on element structure in QLEDs and will continue to develop new technology to lead in advanced displays.
A Samsung spokesman declined to comment on when the company will commercialise self-emissive QLED technology.
STILL A DISTANT FUTURE
Despite Samsung's announcement, the commercialisation of displays that uses quantum dot (QD) as the light source is still far away, and may never be realised at all as there are mountain of challenges ahead.
Research into using QD has focused on avoiding cadmium, which is the best material to use as a light source thanks to its malleability and integrity, but is harmful to humans.
Materials such as indium phosphide have so far failed to match the performance of cadmium when used as the direct light source in actual practice.
Samsung's current flagship TVs are called QLED, which does use QD that are cadmium-free. But they do not use QD as the light sources absorbs electricity directly. Rather, QD is used as a film on Liquid Crystal Display that emits luminance by absorbing the light from the backlight.
The production of the first iteration of this will begin in 2021, but will be QD-enabled OLED, which uses organic material as the light source and QD material as a film. It will be more similar to Samsung's own AMOLED used for mobile phones and LG's OLED TVs.
If Samsung's eventual goal is to launch a self-emissive QLED display, at minimum, the industry will have to wait until 2025 to see if it is indeed viable.
The aggressive investment plan is Samsung Display's attempt to diversify its portfolio amid slowing smartphone growth and the rise of China, with the company set to begin production of 65-inch QD displays in 2021.";2557;['f8xqptn', 'f8xuyv2', 'f8y8c9v', 'f8y8d2o', 'f8y8rxh', 'f8yc6iq', 'f8yettn', 'f8yfcxq', 'f8ygfwd', 'f8yhysp', 'f8yi4id', 'f8yj9cp', 'f8yml1l', 'f8yow23', 'f8ypz5q', 'f8yrz52', 'f8ys40o', 'f8yvoa9', 'f8yyn20', 'f8yyq2r', 'f8z214p', 'f8z4s7g', 'f8z5lu6', 'f8zig1v', 'f8zim8h', 'f8zipko', 'f8zj1ig', 'f8zj33m', 'f8zumdv', 'f8zvyd4', 'f8zym55', 'f8zyr2m', 'f906qho', 'f909w24', 'f90c511', 'f90ldew', 'f90mfky', 'f90uqeg', 'f919wu8', 'f91vmqr'];135;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.375, 0.5, 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.0];0.225;0.4125;0.39843443626273073;0.33796264586489433;9.0;16.5

The new technique could help scientists improve quantum computing and understand quantum gravity.
By splitting a photon, or packet of light, using a special optical crystal, two independent teams of physicists have achieved what they describe as a ""quantum time flip,"" in which a photon exists in both forward and backward time states.
The effect results from the convergence of two strange principles of quantum mechanics (opens in new tab), the counterintuitive rules that govern the behavior of the very small. The first principle, quantum superposition, enables minuscule particles to exist in many different states, or different versions of themselves, at once, until they are observed. The second — charge, parity and time-reversal (CPT) symmetry — states that any system containing particles will obey the same physical laws even if the particles' charges, spatial coordinates and movements through time are flipped as if through a mirror.
By combining these two principles, the physicists produced a photon that appeared to simultaneously travel along and against the arrow of time. They published the results of their twin experiments Oct. 31 (opens in new tab) and Nov. 2 (opens in new tab) on the preprint server arXiv, meaning the findings have yet to be peer-reviewed.
""The concept of the arrow of time is giving a word to the apparent unidirectionality of time that we observe in the macroscopic world we inhabit,"" Teodor Strömberg (opens in new tab), a physicist at the University of Vienna who was first author on one of the papers, told Live Science. ""This is actually in tension with many of the fundamental laws of physics, which by and large are time symmetric, and which therefore do not have a preferred time direction.""
The second law of thermodynamics (opens in new tab) states that the entropy of a system, a rough analogue of its disorder, must increase. Known as the ""arrow of time,"" entropy is one of the few quantities in physics that sets time to go in a particular direction.
This tendency for disorder to grow in the universe explains why it's easier to mix ingredients than to separate them. It's also through this growing disorder that entropy is wedded so intimately to our sense of time. A famous scene in Kurt Vonnegut's novel ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" demonstrates how differently entropy makes one direction of time look to the other by playing World War II in reverse: Bullets are sucked from wounded men; fires are shrunk, gathered into bombs, stacked in neat rows, and separated into composite minerals; and the reversed arrow of time undoes the disorder and devastation of war.
However, as entropy is primarily a statistical concept, it doesn’t apply to single subatomic particles. In fact, in every particle interaction scientists have observed so far — including the up to 1 billion interactions per second that take place inside the world's largest atom smasher, the Large Hadron Collider — CPT symmetry is upheld. So particles seeming to move forward in time are indistinguishable from those in a mirrored system of antiparticles moving backward in time. (Antimatter was created with matter during the Big Bang and doesn't actually move backward in time; it just behaves as if it is following an opposite arrow of time to normal matter.)
The other factor at play in the new experiments is superposition. The most famous demonstration of quantum superposition is Schrödinger's cat, a thought experiment in which a cat is placed inside a sealed box with a vial of poison whose release is triggered by the radioactive decay of an alpha particle. Radioactive decay is a quantum mechanical process that occurs at random, so it is initially impossible to know what happened to the cat, which is in a superposition of states, simultaneously dead and alive, until the box is opened and the outcome observed.
This superposition of states enables a particle to exist in both forward and backward time states at the same time, but witnessing this feat experimentally is tricky. To achieve it, both teams devised similar experiments to split a photon along a superposition of two separate paths through a crystal. The superposed photon moved on one path through the crystal as normal, but another path was configured to change the photon's polarization, or where it points in space, to move as if it were traveling backward in time.
After recombining the superposed photons by sending them through another crystal, the team measured the photon polarization across a number of repeated experiments. They found a quantum interference pattern, a pattern of light and dark stripes that could exist only if the photon had been split and was moving in both time directions.
""The superposition of processes we realized is more akin to an object spinning clockwise and counter-clockwise at the same time,"" Strömberg said. The researchers created their time-flipped photon out of intellectual curiosity, but follow-up experiments showed that time flips can be paired with reversible logic gates to enable simultaneous computation in either direction, thus opening the way for quantum processors with greatly enhanced processing power.
Theoretical possibilities also sprout from the work. A future theory of quantum gravity, which would unite general relativity and quantum mechanics, should include particles of mixed time orientations like the one in this experiment, and could enable the researchers to peer into some of the universe's most mysterious phenomena.
""A nice way to put it is to say that our experiment is a simulation of exotic scenarios where a photon might evolve forward and backward in time,"" Giulio Chiribella, a physicist at the University of Oxford who was the lead author of the other paper, told Live Science. ""What we do is an analogue to some experiments that simulate exotic physics, such as the physics of black holes or time travel.""";5991;['j06cr0l', 'j06keaa', 'j06keyb', 'j06kt2z', 'j06my5c', 'j06nwyz', 'j06q5ho', 'j06qha6', 'j06rwoe', 'j06s3x2', 'j06ss6j', 'j06tghq', 'j06wwfr', 'j06z2b6', 'j071yhh', 'j07azv0', 'j07gop8', 'j07i8qr', 'j07imua', 'j07o4sd', 'j07o85e', 'j07ooxp', 'j07ubhk', 'j07xd9j', 'j080rtp', 'j084af8', 'j088psw', 'j08f5fs', 'j08f8mx', 'j08ftoj', 'j08od1i', 'j08y9r7', 'j09kpyv', 'j09ug9p', 'j0a5nk0', 'j0a6fi9', 'j0aan12', 'j0adi3o', 'j0aoslp', 'j0ffuj7'];69;1;[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.23125;0.45625;0.3968134794837494;0.22801795433693373;9.25;18.25

Physicists at The Australian National University (ANU) have conducted John Wheeler's delayed-choice thought experiment, which involves a moving object that is given the choice to act like a particle or a wave. Wheeler's experiment then asks -- at which point does the object decide?
Common sense says the object is either wave-like or particle-like, independent of how we measure it. But quantum physics predicts that whether you observe wave like behavior (interference) or particle behavior (no interference) depends only on how it is actually measured at the end of its journey. This is exactly what the ANU team found.
""It proves that measurement is everything. At the quantum level, reality does not exist if you are not looking at it,"" said Associate Professor Andrew Truscott from the ANU Research School of Physics and Engineering.
Despite the apparent weirdness, the results confirm the validity of quantum theory, which governs the world of the very small, and has enabled the development of many technologies such as LEDs, lasers and computer chips.
The ANU team not only succeeded in building the experiment, which seemed nearly impossible when it was proposed in 1978, but reversed Wheeler's original concept of light beams being bounced by mirrors, and instead used atoms scattered by laser light.
""Quantum physics predictions about interference seem odd enough when applied to light, which seems more like a wave, but to have done the experiment with atoms, which are complicated things that have mass and interact with electric fields and so on, adds to the weirdness,"" said PhD student Roman Khakimov.
Professor Truscott's team first trapped a collection of helium atoms in a suspended state known as a Bose-Einstein condensate, and then ejected them until there was only a single atom left.
The single atom was then dropped through a pair of counter-propagating laser beams, which formed a grating pattern that acted as crossroads in the same way a solid grating would scatter light.
A second light grating to recombine the paths was randomly added, which led to constructive or destructive interference as if the atom had travelled both paths. When the second light grating was not added, no interference was observed as if the atom chose only one path.
However, the random number determining whether the grating was added was only generated after the atom had passed through the crossroads.
If one chooses to believe that the atom really did take a particular path or paths then one has to accept that a future measurement is affecting the atom's past, said Truscott.
""The atoms did not travel from A to B. It was only when they were measured at the end of the journey that their wave-like or particle-like behavior was brought into existence,"" he said.";2969;['crqd8la', 'crqelzj', 'crqlcqc', 'crqljs5', 'crqlolc', 'crqm56c', 'crqmx5f', 'crqmy7g', 'crqnc1c', 'crqnjdi', 'crqnr8n', 'crqohuy', 'crqpfec', 'crqq4m0', 'crqqe5q', 'crqqhwm', 'crqqzm3', 'crqrcgy', 'crqrx8h', 'crqrztt', 'crqsiye', 'crqsqmt', 'crqsrz8', 'crqsvgh', 'crqt6to', 'crqtri0', 'crqu54r', 'crquh4m', 'crqum89', 'crquuse', 'crqw0kr', 'crqw7ln', 'crqwbk2', 'crqwfzy', 'crqyco0', 'crr3ea9', 'crr75dp', 'crrwczy', 'crsh9kl', 'cryyaz9'];132;1;[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.5];[0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.375, 0.0];0.50625;0.403125;0.4558217167928707;0.21557970538758975;20.25;16.125

The crystal is able to forever cycle between states without losing energy.""]";[nan];2021-09-14;Ben Turner;Otherworldly 'time crystal' made inside Google quantum computer could change physics forever;"Researchers working in partnership with Google may have just used the tech giant's quantum computer to create a completely new phase of matter — a time crystal.
With the ability to forever cycle between two states without ever losing energy, time crystals dodge one of the most important laws of physics — the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the disorder, or entropy, of an isolated system must always increase. These bizarre time crystals remain stable, resisting any dissolution into randomness, despite existing in a constant state of flux.
According to a research article posted July 28 to the preprint database arXiv, scientists were able to create the time crystal for roughly 100 seconds using qubits (quantum computing's version of the traditional computer bit) inside the core of Google's Sycamore quantum processor.
The existence of this weird new matter phase, and the entirely new realm of physical behaviors it reveals, is incredibly exciting to physicists, especially as time crystals were only first predicted to exist just nine years ago.
""This was a big surprise,"" Curt von Keyserlingk, a physicist at the University of Birmingham in the U.K. who was not involved in the study, told Live Science. ""If you asked someone 30, 20 or maybe even 10 years ago, they would not have expected this.""
Time crystals are fascinating objects to physicists because they essentially sidestep the second law of thermodynamics, one of the most ironclad laws in physics. It states that entropy (a rough analog for the amount of disorder in a system) always increases. If you want to make something more ordered, you need to put more energy into it.
This tendency for disorder to grow explains a lot of things, such as why it's easier to stir ingredients into a mixture than it is to separate them out again, or why headphone cords get so tangled in pants' pockets. It also sets the arrow of time, with the past universe always more ordered than the present; watching a video in reverse, for instance, is likely to look strange to you primarily because you're witnessing the counterintuitive reversal of this entropic flow.(opens in new tab)
Time crystals don't follow this rule. Instead of slowly approaching thermal equilibrium — ""thermalizing"" so that their energy or temperature is equally distributed throughout their surroundings, they get stuck between two energy states above that equilibrium state, cycling back and forth between them indefinitely.
To explain how deeply unusual this behavior is, von Keyserlingk said to picture a sealed box filled with coins before being shaken a million times. As the coins ricochet from, and bounce around, each other, they ""become more and more chaotic, exploring all of the sorts of configurations that they can explore"" until the shaking stops, and the box is opened to reveal the coins in a random configuration, with roughly half of the coins facing up and half facing down. We can expect to see this random, half-up, half-down endpoint regardless of the way we first arranged the coins in the box.
Inside the ""box"" of Google's Sycamore, we can view the quantum processor's qubits much like we would our coins. In the same way that the coins can be either heads or tails, qubits can be either a 1 or a 0 — the two possible positions in a two-state system — or a weird mix of the probabilities of both states called a superposition. What's weird about time crystals, von Keyserlingk says, is that no amount of shaking, or zapping from one state to another, can move the time crystal's qubits into the lowest energy state, which is a random configuration; they can only flip it from its starting state to its second state, then back again.
""It just sort of flip-flops,"" von Keyserlingk said. ""It doesn't end up looking random, it just gets jammed stuck. It's like it remembers what it looked like initially, and it repeats that pattern over time.""
In this sense, a time crystal is like a pendulum that never stops swinging.
""Even if you totally physically isolate a pendulum from the universe, so there's no friction and no air resistance, it will eventually stop. And that's because of the second law of thermodynamics,"" Achilleas Lazarides, a physicist at the University of Loughborough in the U.K. who was among the scientists to first discover the theoretical possibility of the new phase in 2015, told Live Science. ""Energy starts out concentrated in the pendulum's center of mass, but there's all of these internal degrees of freedom — like the ways the atoms can vibrate inside the rod — that it will eventually be transferred into.""
In fact, there's no way for a large-scale object to behave like a time crystal without sounding absurd, because the only rules that enable time crystals to exist are the spooky and surreal rules that govern the world of the very small — quantum mechanics.
In the quantum world, objects behave both like point particles and little waves at the same time, with the magnitude of these waves in any given region of space representing the probability of finding a particle at that location. But randomness (such as random defects in a crystal's structure or a programmed randomness in the interaction strengths between qubits) can cause a particle's probability wave to cancel itself out everywhere apart from one very small region. Rooted in place, unable to move, change states or thermalize with its surroundings, the particle becomes localized.
The researchers used this localization process as the foundation of their experiment. Using 20 strips of superconducting aluminum for their qubits, the scientists programmed each one into one of two possible states. Then, by blasting a microwave beam over the strips, they were able to drive their qubits to flip states; the researchers repeated the experiment for tens of thousands of runs and stopped at different points to record the states their qubits were in. What they found was that their collection of qubits was flipping back and forth between only two configurations, and the qubits weren't absorbing heat from the microwave beam either — they had made a time crystal.
They also saw a key clue that their time crystal was a phase of matter. For something to be considered a phase, it usually has to be very stable in the face of fluctuations. Solids will not melt if the temperatures around them vary slightly; neither will slight fluctuations cause liquids to evaporate or freeze suddenly. In the same way, if the microwave beam used to flip the qubits between states was adjusted to be close to but slightly off from the exact 180 degrees needed for a perfect flip, the qubits still nonetheless flipped to the other state.
""It's not the case that if you're not exactly at the 180 degrees you will scramble them,"" Lazarides said. ""It [the time crystal] magically will always tip a bit in, even if you're making slight mistakes.""
Another hallmark of moving from one phase to another is the breaking of physical symmetries, the idea that the laws of physics are the same for an object at any point in time or space. As a liquid, the molecules in water follow the same physical laws at every point in space and in every direction, but cool water down enough so that it transforms into ice and its molecules will pick regular points along a crystal structure — or lattice — to arrange themselves across. Suddenly, the water molecules have preferred points in space to occupy, and they leave the other points empty — the spatial symmetry of the water has been spontaneously broken.
In much the same way that ice becomes a crystal in space by breaking with spatial symmetry, time crystals become crystals in time by breaking with time symmetry. At first, before their transformation into the time crystal phase, the row of qubits will experience a continuous symmetry between all moments in time. But the periodic cycle of the microwave beam chops the constant conditions experienced by the qubits down into discrete packets (making the symmetry imposed by the beam a discrete time-translation symmetry). Then, by flipping back and forth at twice the period of the wavelength of the beam, the qubits break with the discrete time-translation symmetry imposed by the laser. They are the first objects we know of that are able to do this.
All of this weirdness makes time crystals rich in new physics, and the control that Sycamore provides researchers beyond other experimental setups could make it an ideal platform for further investigation. That's not to say it cannot be improved, however. Like all quantum systems, Google's quantum computer needs to be perfectly isolated from its environment to prevent its qubits from undergoing a process called decoherence, which eventually breaks down the quantum localization effects, destroying the time crystal. The researchers are working on ways to better isolate their processor and mitigate the impact of decoherence, but it's unlikely they will eliminate the effect for good.
Despite this, Google's experiment is likely to remain the best way to study time crystals for the foreseeable future. Though numerous other projects have succeeded in making what convincingly appear to be time crystals in other ways — with diamonds, helium-3 superfluids, quasiparticles called magnons and with Bose-Einstein condensates — for the most part the crystals produced in these setups dissipate too quickly for detailed study.
The theoretical newness of the crystals is in some ways a double-edged sword, as physicists currently struggle to find clear applications for them, although von Keyserlingk has suggested that they could be used as highly accurate sensors. Other proposals include using the crystals for better memory storage or for developing quantum computers with even faster processing power.
But in another sense, the greatest application of time crystals may already be here: They allow scientists to probe the boundaries of quantum mechanics.

This may be a watershed moment in the history of computer science.
The term for a clear case in which a quantum computer can perform computations or run algorithms that no classical computer, now or in the conceivable future, could is “quantum advantage.” Until now, it’s never been achieved.
Sure, there are algorithms that, theoretically couldn’t be run on a classical system. But none of those theories have been proven. Now quantum advantage is no longer up for debate.
One of the authors on the paper, TUM’s Robert Konig, told Phys.org “Our result shows that quantum information processing really does provide benefits—without having to rely on unproven complexity-theoretic conjectures.”
The team set out, specifically, to prove that quantum computers can do something (anything, really) regular computers can’t. To do this, they simply built a quantum circuit that solves a complex algebraic formula through the exploitation of a quantum physics loophole allowing things to be in two places at once. No biggie.
This particular formula, according to the researchers, cannot be solved using classical computer circuits. You can read the whole paper here if you want to know more about how the team demonstrated actual quantum advantage.
As for what this accomplishment means? Well, there’s nothing tangible to point out. The algorithm that the researchers ran wasn’t an algebraic mystery whose solution will result in any immediate impact – at least as best as we can tell. It was, almost certainly, developed simply to prove it could be done.
But that’s the point. By showing that the people claiming quantum advantage was a fantasy were wrong, and that the research is heading in the right direction, we’re closer than ever to realizing the potential of quantum computing.
The field of quantum computing may be decades from producing something that changes “everything” in the way that media hype and marketing teams would have us all believe. But proof of quantum advantage is the guarantee that this research is going to pay off some day.";2270;['e81riql', 'e81ua0k', 'e81v9mg', 'e81vutn', 'e81x2mc', 'e81ym08', 'e81yszj', 'e81zzee', 'e821c0v', 'e822iyt', 'e823nsb', 'e823zr3', 'e824q2j', 'e829mz4', 'e82burl', 'e82cj7j', 'e82dig6', 'e82f4zp', 'e82kqq4', 'e82l1ig', 'e82lnrl', 'e82mm84', 'e82mzj6', 'e82p0u9', 'e82r3z8', 'e82rajt', 'e82rtmj', 'e82rvlc', 'e82rzk4', 'e82uiy2', 'e82uv35', 'e82yftf', 'e831a5c', 'e832rwh', 'e833bca', 'e835ntj', 'e83633t', 'e83bdu8', 'e83g8jw', 'e83qtot'];62;1;[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];[1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.125, 0.75, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0];0.50625;0.45625;0.4952508833914383;0.3628769591748696;20.25;18.25

For now, we have to make do with significantly smaller systems and today, IBM announced the launch of its Osprey quantum processor, which features 433 qubits, up from the 127 qubits of its 2021 Eagle processor. And with that, the slow but steady march toward a quantum processor with real-world applications continues.
“The new 433 qubit ‘Osprey’ processor brings us a step closer to the point where quantum computers will be used to tackle previously unsolvable problems,” said Darío Gil, senior vice president, IBM and director of Research. “We are continuously scaling up and advancing our quantum technology across hardware, software and classical integration to meet the biggest challenges of our time, in conjunction with our partners and clients worldwide. This work will prove foundational for the coming era of quantum-centric supercomputing.”
IBM’s quantum roadmap includes two additional stages — the 1,121-qubit Condor and 1,386-qubit Flamingo processors in 2023 and 2024 — before it plans to hit the 4,000-qubit stage with its Kookaburra processor in 2025. So far, the company has generally been able to make this roadmap work, but the number of qubits in a quantum processor is obviously only one part of a very large and complex puzzle, with longer coherence times and reduced noise being just as important.
Ideally, that’s something developers who want to work with these machines wouldn’t have to worry about, so increasingly, the tools they use are abstracting the hardware away for them. With the new version of its Qiskit Runtime, for example, developers can now trade speed for reduced error count.
The company also today detailed its Quantum System Two — basically IBM’s quantum mainframe — which will be able to house multiple quantum processors and integrate them into a single system with high-speed communication links.

The National Quantum Initiative Act (H.R. 6227) authorizes $1.2 billion over five years for federal activities aimed at boosting investment in quantum information science, or QIS, and supporting a quantum-smart workforce.
The law also establishes a National Quantum Coordination Office, calls for the development of a five-year strategic plan and establishes an advisory committee to advise the White House on issues relating to quantum computing.
“This next great technological revolution has far-reaching implications for job creation, economic growth and national security,” Michael Kratsios, deputy assistant to the president for technology policy, said in a White House statement. “We look forward to building upon efforts to support the quantum-smart workforce of the future and engage with government, academic and private-sector leaders to advance QIS.”
Today’s White House signing came after the bill was approved by unanimous consent in the Senate and by a vote of 348-11 vote in the House.
Quantum computing make use of weird subatomic phenomena to provide capabilities that are beyond the scope of classical computers. Classical computing technologies make use of electronic bits that represent either “on” or “off,” one or zero. In contrast, quantum computers manipulate “qubits” that can represent ones and zeroes simultaneously.
The quantum approach is particularly well-suited to certain types of tasks, including the prime factorization of large numbers. That’s important, because modern-day encryption techniques are based on prime factorization. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could conceivably crack the code that currently protects secure communications and financial transactions.
Earlier this month, a report from the National Academies of Science said there is an urgent need to develop “post-quantum” encryption protocols in order to protect commerce and national security.
QIS research could also produce new types of quantum processors, sensors, navigation tools and security systems. The challenges could bring about “new approaches to understanding materials, chemistry and even gravity through quantum information theory,” according to a White House strategy paper issued in September.
Researchers in the U.S. and allied countries have made lots of headway in quantum computing over the past couple of decades. For example, Canada’s D-Wave Systems recently reported that its 2,048-qubit quantum computer could be used to simulate exotic phenomena associated with superconductivity. D-Wave, which counts Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos among its investors, has been working for years with Google, NASA, Lockheed Martin and other customers on the frontiers of quantum computing.
Microsoft has its own initiative in the field: At last year’s GeekWire Summit, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella listed quantum computing, along with artificial intelligence and mixed reality, as a core technology that will shape his company’s future.

Quick: what’s 4 + 5? Nine right? Slightly less quick: what’s five plus four? Still nine, right?
Okay, let’s wait a few seconds. Bear with me. Feel free to have a quick stretch.
Now, without looking, what was the answer to the first question?
It’s still nine, isn’t it?
You’ve just performed a series of advanced brain functions. You did math based on prompts designed to appeal to entirely different parts of your brain and you displayed the ability to recall previous information when queried later. Great job!
This might seem like old hat to most of us, but it’s actually quite an amazing feat of brain power.
And, based on some recent research by a pair of teams from the University of Bonn and the University of Tübingen, these simple processes could indicate that you’re a quantum computer.
Let’s do the math
Your brain probably isn’t wired for numbers. It’s great at math, but numbers are a relatively new concept for humans.
Numbers showed up in human history approximately 6,000 years ago with the Mesopotamians, but our species has been around for about 300,000 years.
Prehistoric humans still had things to count. They didn’t randomly forget how many children they had just because there wasn’t a bespoke language for numerals yet.
Instead, they found other methods for expressing quantities or tracking objects such as holding up their fingers or using representative models.
If you had to keep track of dozens of cave-mates, for example, you might carry a pebble to represent each one. As people trickled in from a hard day of hunting, gathering, and whatnot, you could shift the pebbles from one container to another as an accounting method.
It might seem sub-optimal, but the human brain really doesn’t care whether you use numbers, words, or concepts when it comes to math.
Let’s do the research
The aforementioned research teams recently published a fascinating paper titled “Neuronal codes for arithmetic rule processing in the human brain.”
As the title intimates, the researchers identified an abstract code for processing addition and subtraction inside the human brain. This is significant because we really don’t know how the brain handles math.
You can’t just slap some electrodes on someone’s scalp or stick them in a CAT scan machine to suss out the nature of human calculation.
Math happens at the individual neuron level inside the human brain. EKG readings and CAT scans can only provide a general picture of all the noise our neurons produce.
And, as there are some 86 billion neurons making noise inside our heads, those kinds of readings aren’t what you’d call an “exact science.”
The Bonn and Tübingen teams got around this problem by conducting their research on volunteers who already had subcranial electrode implants for the treatment of epilepsy.
Nine volunteers met the study’s criteria and, because of the nature of their implants, they were able to provide what might be the world’s first glimpse into how the brain actually handles math.
Per the research paper:
    We found abstract and notation-independent codes for addition and subtraction in neuronal populations.
    Decoders applied to time-resolved recordings demonstrate a static code in hippocampus based on persistently rule-selective neurons, in contrast to a dynamic code in parahippocampal cortex originating from neurons carrying rapidly changing rule information.
An image of single neuron activity
Single neurons across multiple brain sectors responding to different encoded rules for math.
Basically, the researchers saw that different parts of the brain light up when we do addition than when we do subtraction. They also discovered that different parts of the brain approach these tasks with different timing.
It’s a bit complex, but the gist of it is that one part of our brain tries to figure out the problem while another works on a solution.
As the researchers put it:
    Neuron recordings in human and nonhuman primates, as well as computational modeling, suggest different cognitive functions for these two codes for working memory: although a dynamic code seems to suffice for short maintenance of more implicit information in memory, the intense mental manipulation of the attended working memory contents may require a static code.
    Following this logic, parahippocampal cortex may represent a short-term memory of the arithmetic rule, whereas downstream hippocampus may “do the math” and process numbers according to the arithmetic rule at hand.
Let’s take inventory
So far we’ve learned that every math process requires both a hard-coded memory solution (a static rule) and a novel one (a dynamic rule). And each of those is transient based on what kind of arithmetic we’re performing.
Keeping in mind that there are 86 billion neurons in the human brain, and that something as basic as simple arithmetic appears to be hidden across all or most of them, it’s obvious there’s something more complex than simple pebble-counting going on.
Per the paper:
    Mental calculation is a classic working memory task, and although working memory has traditionally been attributed to the prefrontal cortex, more recent data suggest that the MTL may also be important in working memory tasks and that it is part of a brain-wide network subserving working memory.
Either our brains are working extra-hard to do simple binary mathematics or they’re quantum computing systems doing what they do best: hallucinating answers.
The art of math
Think about an apple. No, not that one. Think about a green apple. How many calculations did it take for you to arrive at a specific apple density and relative size? Did you have to adjust the input variables in order to produce an apple that wasn’t red?
I’m going to go out on a limb and say you didn’t. You just thought about some apples and they happened inside your head. You hallucinated those apples.
Artificial intelligence systems designed to produce original content based on learned styles go through the exact same process.
These AI systems aren’t using advanced math features to psychologically exploit the human propensity for art or imagery. They’re just following some simple rules and swirling data around until they spit out something their creators will reward them for.
That’s kind of how your brain does math. At least according to this new research, anyway. It uses rules to surface the answer that makes the most sense. There’s a part that tries to get the “correct” solution based on things that never change (one plus one always equals two) and another part that tries to guess based on intuition when the answer isn’t something we have memorized.
And that’s why two humans of relative intelligence and education can perceive the same scene differently when it comes to processing math. Can you guess how many candies are in the jar below?
a jar full of colored candies
There’s not enough information for you to deduce the correct answer but that doesn’t stop your brain from trying to do math.
What does it all mean?
That remains to be seen. The simple fact that scientists were able to observe individual neurons participating in the math process inside human brains is astounding.
But it could take years of further research to understand the ramifications of these findings. First and foremost, we have to ask: is the human brain a quantum computer?
It makes sense, and this research might give us our first actual glimpses at a quantum function inside the human brain. But, as far as we can tell, they were only able to record and process hundreds of neurons at a time. That’s obviously a very tiny drop from a giant bucket of data.
To help with that, the researchers created an artificial intelligence system to interpret the data in a more robust manner. The hope is that continued research will lead to a greater understanding of math processes in the brain.
Per the paper’s conclusion:
    More fine-grained analyses, ideally combined with perturbation approaches, will help to decipher the individual roles of brain areas and neuronal codes in mental arithmetic.
Yet, there could be potential implications on a much grander scale. The researchers don’t mention the ramifications for technology in their biology experiment or directly discuss its results in quantum computing terms.
But, if this research is accurate, Occam’s Razor tells us that the human brain is probably a quantum computer. Either that, or it’s poorly-designed.
Just like our prehistoric ancestors would have carved notches on the handles of their tools to keep track of objects, a binary brain should be able to handle counting objects through localized abstraction mechanisms.
Why go through all the trouble of hallucinating an answer across myriad neuronal complexes when individual neurons could just pretend to be ones and zeros like a binary computer?
The answer may lie in the quantum nature of the universe. When you perform a simple math function, such as adding two plus two, your brain may hallucinate all of the possible answers at once while simultaneously working to both remember the answer (you’ve definitely added those numbers before) and to process the data (1+1+1+1).
If the human brain were binary, you’d probably have to wait for it to go through each permutation individually instead of hallucinating them all at once.
The result is that you’re probably answering the question in your head before you can actively recognize that you’re thinking about it because both functions occur simultaneously. That’s called quantum time travel.

Let’s do the math
Your brain probably isn’t wired for numbers. It’s great at math, but numbers are a relatively new concept for humans.
Numbers showed up in human history approximately 6,000 years ago with the Mesopotamians, but our species has been around for about 300,000 years.
Prehistoric humans still had things to count. They didn’t randomly forget how many children they had just because there wasn’t a bespoke language for numerals yet.
Instead, they found other methods for expressing quantities or tracking objects such as holding up their fingers or using representative models.
If you had to keep track of dozens of cave-mates, for example, you might carry a pebble to represent each one. As people trickled in from a hard day of hunting, gathering, and whatnot, you could shift the pebbles from one container to another as an accounting method.
It might seem sub-optimal, but the human brain really doesn’t care whether you use numbers, words, or concepts when it comes to math.
Let’s do the research
The aforementioned research teams recently published a fascinating paper titled “Neuronal codes for arithmetic rule processing in the human brain.”
As the title intimates, the researchers identified an abstract code for processing addition and subtraction inside the human brain. This is significant because we really don’t know how the brain handles math.
You can’t just slap some electrodes on someone’s scalp or stick them in a CAT scan machine to suss out the nature of human calculation.
Math happens at the individual neuron level inside the human brain. EKG readings and CAT scans can only provide a general picture of all the noise our neurons produce.
And, as there are some 86 billion neurons making noise inside our heads, those kinds of readings aren’t what you’d call an “exact science.”
The Bonn and Tübingen teams got around this problem by conducting their research on volunteers who already had subcranial electrode implants for the treatment of epilepsy.
Nine volunteers met the study’s criteria and, because of the nature of their implants, they were able to provide what might be the world’s first glimpse into how the brain actually handles math.
Per the research paper:
    We found abstract and notation-independent codes for addition and subtraction in neuronal populations.
    Decoders applied to time-resolved recordings demonstrate a static code in hippocampus based on persistently rule-selective neurons, in contrast to a dynamic code in parahippocampal cortex originating from neurons carrying rapidly changing rule information.
An image of single neuron activity
Single neurons across multiple brain sectors responding to different encoded rules for math.
Basically, the researchers saw that different parts of the brain light up when we do addition than when we do subtraction. They also discovered that different parts of the brain approach these tasks with different timing.
It’s a bit complex, but the gist of it is that one part of our brain tries to figure out the problem while another works on a solution.
As the researchers put it:
    Neuron recordings in human and nonhuman primates, as well as computational modeling, suggest different cognitive functions for these two codes for working memory: although a dynamic code seems to suffice for short maintenance of more implicit information in memory, the intense mental manipulation of the attended working memory contents may require a static code.
    Following this logic, parahippocampal cortex may represent a short-term memory of the arithmetic rule, whereas downstream hippocampus may “do the math” and process numbers according to the arithmetic rule at hand.
Let’s take inventory
So far we’ve learned that every math process requires both a hard-coded memory solution (a static rule) and a novel one (a dynamic rule). And each of those is transient based on what kind of arithmetic we’re performing.
Keeping in mind that there are 86 billion neurons in the human brain, and that something as basic as simple arithmetic appears to be hidden across all or most of them, it’s obvious there’s something more complex than simple pebble-counting going on.
Per the paper:
    Mental calculation is a classic working memory task, and although working memory has traditionally been attributed to the prefrontal cortex, more recent data suggest that the MTL may also be important in working memory tasks and that it is part of a brain-wide network subserving working memory.
Either our brains are working extra-hard to do simple binary mathematics or they’re quantum computing systems doing what they do best: hallucinating answers.
The art of math
Think about an apple. No, not that one. Think about a green apple. How many calculations did it take for you to arrive at a specific apple density and relative size? Did you have to adjust the input variables in order to produce an apple that wasn’t red?
I’m going to go out on a limb and say you didn’t. You just thought about some apples and they happened inside your head. You hallucinated those apples.
Artificial intelligence systems designed to produce original content based on learned styles go through the exact same process.
These AI systems aren’t using advanced math features to psychologically exploit the human propensity for art or imagery. They’re just following some simple rules and swirling data around until they spit out something their creators will reward them for.
That’s kind of how your brain does math. At least according to this new research, anyway. It uses rules to surface the answer that makes the most sense. There’s a part that tries to get the “correct” solution based on things that never change (one plus one always equals two) and another part that tries to guess based on intuition when the answer isn’t something we have memorized.
And that’s why two humans of relative intelligence and education can perceive the same scene differently when it comes to processing math. Can you guess how many candies are in the jar below?
a jar full of colored candies
There’s not enough information for you to deduce the correct answer but that doesn’t stop your brain from trying to do math.
What does it all mean?
That remains to be seen. The simple fact that scientists were able to observe individual neurons participating in the math process inside human brains is astounding.
But it could take years of further research to understand the ramifications of these findings. First and foremost, we have to ask: is the human brain a quantum computer?
It makes sense, and this research might give us our first actual glimpses at a quantum function inside the human brain. But, as far as we can tell, they were only able to record and process hundreds of neurons at a time. That’s obviously a very tiny drop from a giant bucket of data.
To help with that, the researchers created an artificial intelligence system to interpret the data in a more robust manner. The hope is that continued research will lead to a greater understanding of math processes in the brain.
Per the paper’s conclusion:
    More fine-grained analyses, ideally combined with perturbation approaches, will help to decipher the individual roles of brain areas and neuronal codes in mental arithmetic.
Yet, there could be potential implications on a much grander scale. The researchers don’t mention the ramifications for technology in their biology experiment or directly discuss its results in quantum computing terms.
But, if this research is accurate, Occam’s Razor tells us that the human brain is probably a quantum computer. Either that, or it’s poorly-designed.
Just like our prehistoric ancestors would have carved notches on the handles of their tools to keep track of objects, a binary brain should be able to handle counting objects through localized abstraction mechanisms.
Why go through all the trouble of hallucinating an answer across myriad neuronal complexes when individual neurons could just pretend to be ones and zeros like a binary computer?
The answer may lie in the quantum nature of the universe. When you perform a simple math function, such as adding two plus two, your brain may hallucinate all of the possible answers at once while simultaneously working to both remember the answer (you’ve definitely added those numbers before) and to process the data (1+1+1+1).
If the human brain were binary, you’d probably have to wait for it to go through each permutation individually instead of hallucinating them all at once.
The result is that you’re probably answering the question in your head before you can actively recognize that you’re thinking about it because both functions occur simultaneously. That’s called quantum time travel.";19182;['hx5t9tb', 'hx61wff', 'hx636b8', 'hx68i30', 'hx69exn', 'hx6fm09', 'hx6h3dz', 'hx6nis2', 'hx6ps8z', 'hx6u3kr', 'hx6vapk', 'hx6w5c9', 'hx6x0pb', 'hx6yh66', 'hx71hn7', 'hx75vxc', 'hx77mmn', 'hx786xq', 'hx7bivo', 'hx7bkim', 'hx7ctj6', 'hx7imuq', 'hx7pu65', 'hx7w51o', 'hx8gov1', 'hx8h6y4', 'hx8khyj', 'hx8ktoz', 'hx8l6a4', 'hx8lzol', 'hx8pczs', 'hx8qeao', 'hx8qifh', 'hx8qket', 'hx8r5yj', 'hx8w3al', 'hx9d8rj', 'hx9dov4', 'hx9vh56', 'hxfsspb'];109;1;[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0];[0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5];0.25625;0.3375;0.3972070461358912;0.22395591083961144;10.25;13.5

A special form of light made using an ancient Namibian gemstone could be the key to new light-based quantum computers, which could solve long-held scientific mysteries, according to new research led by the University of St Andrews.
The research, conducted in collaboration with scientists at Harvard University in the US, Macquarie University in Australia and Aarhus University in Denmark and published in Nature Materials, used a naturally mined cuprous oxide (Cu2O) gemstone from Namibia to produce Rydberg polaritons, the largest hybrid particles of light and matter ever created.
Rydberg polaritons switch continually from light to matter and back again. In Rydberg polaritons, light and matter are like two sides of a coin, and the matter side is what makes polaritons interact with each other.
This interaction is crucial because this is what allows the creation of quantum simulators, a special type of quantum computer, where information is stored in quantum bits. These quantum bits, unlike the binary bits in classical computers that can only be 0 or 1, can take any value between 0 and 1. They can therefore store much more information and perform several processes simultaneously.
This capability could allow quantum simulators to solve important mysteries of physics, chemistry and biology, for example, how to make high-temperature superconductors for highspeed trains, how cheaper fertilisers could be made potentially solving global hunger, or how proteins fold making it easier to produce more effective drugs.
Project lead Dr Hamid Ohadi, of the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, said: “Making a quantum simulator with light is the holy grail of science. We have taken a huge leap towards this by creating Rydberg polaritons, the key ingredient of it.”
To create Rydberg polaritons, the researchers trapped light between two highly reflective mirrors. A cuprous oxide crystal from a stone mined in Namibia was then thinned and polished to a 30-micrometer thick slab (thinner than a strand of human hair) and sandwiched between the two mirrors to make Rydberg polaritons 100 times larger than ever demonstrated before.
One of the leading authors Dr Sai Kiran Rajendran, of the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, said: “Purchasing the stone on eBay was easy. The challenge was to make Rydberg polaritons that exist in an extremely narrow colour range.”
The team is currently further refining these methods in order to explore the possibility of making quantum circuits, which are the next ingredient for quantum simulators.";2661;['i50qj68', 'i50zbe0', 'i510xmy', 'i5123zb', 'i512fcm', 'i512mkb', 'i513gd2', 'i518bmz', 'i51bva4', 'i51ewae', 'i51g8aj', 'i51hzf7', 'i51i7n1', 'i51jv19', 'i51lst9', 'i51rgdl', 'i51tq5x', 'i51wv62', 'i51xebw', 'i51zsv0', 'i520l72', 'i524h9y', 'i5277yf', 'i5284pv', 'i52889a', 'i528a4s', 'i52b6j6', 'i52bcke', 'i52bmfv', 'i52ewji', 'i52h9th', 'i52i8g0', 'i52podc', 'i52y4av', 'i53cv80', 'i53mvqh', 'i548og9', 'i549llb', 'i54i7jc', 'i54wbog'];117;1;[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25];0.19375;0.4375;0.37702577829639183;0.21650635094610965;7.75;17.5

Researchers from the Yokohama National University have teleported quantum information securely within the confines of a diamond.'];[nan];2019-06-28;;Researchers teleport information within a diamond;"Researchers from the Yokohama National University have teleported quantum information securely within the confines of a diamond. The study has big implications for quantum information technology - the future of how sensitive information is shared and stored.
The researchers published their results on June 28, 2019 in Communications Physics.
""Quantum teleportation permits the transfer of quantum information into an otherwise inaccessible space,"" said Hideo Kosaka, a professor of engineering at Yokohama National University and an author on the study. ""It also permits the transfer of information into a quantum memory without revealing or destroying the stored quantum information.""
The inaccessible space, in this case, consisted of carbon atoms in diamond. Made of linked, yet individually contained, carbon atoms, a diamond holds the perfect ingredients for quantum teleportation.
A carbon atom holds six protons and six neutrons in its nucleus, surrounded by six spinning electrons. As the atoms bond into a diamond, they form a notoriously strong lattice. Diamonds can have complex defects, though, when a nitrogen atom exists in one of two adjacent vacancies where carbon atoms should be. This defect is called a nitrogen-vacancy center.
Surrounded by carbon atoms, the nucleus structure of the nitrogen atom creates what Kosaka calls a nanomagnet.
To manipulate an electron and a carbon isotope in the vacancy, Kosaka and the team attached a wire about a quarter the width of a human hair to the surface of a diamond. They applied a microwave and a radio wave to the wire to build an oscillating magnetic field around the diamond. They shaped the microwave to create the optimal, controlled conditions for the transfer of quantum information within the diamond.
Kosaka then used the nitrogen nanomagnet to anchor an electron. Using the microwave and radio waves, Kosaka forced the electron spin to entangle with a carbon nuclear spin - the angular momentum of the electron and the nucleus of a carbon atom. The electron spin breaks down under a magnetic field created by the nanomagnet, allowing it to become susceptible to entanglement. Once the two pieces are entangled, meaning their physical characteristics are so intertwined they cannot be described individually, a photon which holds quantum information is applied and the electron absorbs the photon. The absorption allows the polarization state of the photon to be transferred into the carbon, which is mediated by the entangled electron, demonstrating a teleportation of information at the quantum level.
""The success of the photon storage in the other node establishes the entanglement between two adjacent nodes,"" Kosaka said. Called quantum repeaters, the process can take individual chunks of information from node to node, across the quantum field.
""Our ultimate goal is to realize scalable quantum repeaters for long-haul quantum communications and distributed quantum computers for large-scale quantum computation and metrology,"" Kosaka said.";3020;['es8zlwb', 'es93q1p', 'es97ce2', 'es98kob', 'es98t23', 'es99u9a', 'es9b1w5', 'es9c1d7', 'es9enms', 'es9evnh', 'es9fcor', 'es9frr5', 'es9gkom', 'es9gvlq', 'es9hr47', 'es9hy36', 'es9k42y', 'es9kitr', 'es9lf2r', 'es9luia', 'es9pl5d', 'es9pzuc', 'es9rt2t', 'es9vh8p', 'es9yh87', 'es9zymh', 'esa04qu', 'esa1pb8', 'esa5rxb', 'esacxky', 'esafmp4', 'esahrt6', 'esai2jj', 'esalljk', 'esanmuv', 'esaolv1', 'esaukwy', 'esbdk5n', 'esbh8m1', 'esdwhcf'];116;1;[0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];[1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.625, 0.125, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5];0.4;0.55;0.45000000000000007;0.2663409469082815;16.0;22.0

In a paper published on Thursday in the journal Science, physicists at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience at the Delft University of Technology reported that they were able to reliably teleport information between two quantum bits separated by three meters, or about 10 feet.
Quantum teleportation is not the “Star Trek”-style movement of people or things; rather, it involves transferring so-called quantum information — in this case what is known as the spin state of an electron — from one place to another without moving the physical matter to which the information is attached.
Classical bits, the basic units of information in computing, can have only one of two values — either 0 or 1. But quantum bits, or qubits, can simultaneously describe many values. They hold out both the possibility of a new generation of faster computing systems and the ability to create completely secure communication networks.
Moreover, the scientists are now closer to definitively proving Einstein wrong in his early disbelief in the notion of entanglement, in which particles separated by light-years can still appear to remain connected, with the state of one particle instantaneously affecting the state of another.
They report that they have achieved perfectly accurate teleportation of quantum information over short distances. They are now seeking to repeat their experiment over the distance of more than a kilometer. If they are able to repeatedly show that entanglement works at this distance, it will be a definitive demonstration of the entanglement phenomenon and quantum mechanical theory.
Succeeding at greater distances will offer an affirmative solution to a thought experiment known as Bell’s theorem, proposed in 1964 by the Irish physicist John Stewart Bell as a method for determining whether particles connected via quantum entanglement communicate information faster than the speed of light.
“There is a big race going on between five or six groups to prove Einstein wrong,” said Ronald Hanson, a physicist who leads the group at Delft. “There is one very big fish.”
In the past, scientists have made halting gains in teleporting quantum information, a feat that is achieved by forcing physically separated quantum bits into an entangled state.
But reliability of quantum teleportation has been elusive. For example, in 2009, University of Maryland physicists demonstrated the transfer of quantum information, but only one of every 100 million attempts succeeded, meaning that transferring a single bit of quantum information required roughly 10 minutes.
In contrast, the scientists at Delft have achieved the ability “deterministically,” meaning they can now teleport the quantum state of two entangled electrons accurately 100 percent of the time.
They did so by producing qubits using electrons trapped in diamonds at extremely low temperatures. According to Dr. Hanson, the diamonds effectively create “miniprisons” in which the electrons were held. The researchers were able to establish a spin, or value, for electrons, and then read the value reliably.
In addition to the possibility of an impregnable quantum Internet, the research holds out the possibility of networks of quantum computers.
To date, practical quantum computers, which could solve certain classes of problems far more quickly than even the most powerful computers now in use, remain a distant goal. A functional quantum computer would need to entangle a large number of qubits and maintain that entangled state for relatively long periods, something that has so far not been achieved.
A distributed quantum network might also offer new forms of privacy, Dr. Hanson suggested. Such a network would make it possible for a remote user to perform a quantum calculation on a server, while at the same time making it impossible for the operator of the server to determine the nature of the calculation.";4108;['chugknm', 'chujucs', 'chukorb', 'chuksue', 'chukvvc', 'chul5vv', 'chulkcg', 'chuloqq', 'chum1ag', 'chumfwa', 'chumn27', 'chumprv', 'chumq5i', 'chumryl', 'chuniol', 'chuo8kd', 'chuolz9', 'chuoxh9', 'chuozr0', 'chup55j', 'chuq92r', 'chur7qy', 'churf6e', 'chus5dx', 'chus6ek', 'chus9ui', 'chusdev', 'chusffp', 'chutjo0', 'chutx2p', 'chutxu6', 'chuu6ta', 'chuupv9', 'chuwy67', 'chuyns9', 'chuysrn', 'chuzf2j', 'chuzujc', 'chv0hij', 'chv0ivm'];113;1;[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5];0.50625;0.50625;0.45923679893928365;0.26212771219388464;20.25;20.25

Using phonons, instead of photons, to store information in quantum computers may have advantages in achieving unprecedented processing power.'];[nan];2019-08-30;Leila Sloman;Trapping the Tiniest Sound;"Researchers have gained control of the elusive “particle” of sound, the phonon. Although phonons—the smallest units of the vibrational energy that makes up sound waves—are not matter, they can be considered particles the way photons are particles of light. Photons commonly store information in prototype quantum computers, which aim to harness quantum effects to achieve unprecedented processing power. Using sound instead may have advantages, although it would require manipulating phonons on very fine scales.
Until recently, scientists lacked this ability; just detecting an individual phonon destroyed it. Early methods involved converting phonons to electricity in quantum circuits called superconducting qubits. These circuits accept energy in specific amounts; if a phonon’s energy matches, the circuit can absorb it—destroying the phonon but giving an energy reading of its presence.
In a new study, scientists at JILA (a collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Colorado Boulder) tuned the energy units of their superconducting qubit so phonons would not be destroyed. Instead the phonons sped up the current in the circuit, thanks to a special material that created an electric field in response to vibrations. Experimenters could then detect how much change in current each phonon caused.
“There’s been a lot of recent and impressive successes using superconducting qubits to control the quantum states of light. And we were curious—what can you do with sound that you can’t with light?” says Lucas Sletten of U.C. Boulder, lead author of the study published in June in Physical Review X. One difference is speed: sound travels much slower than light. Sletten and his colleagues took advantage of this to coordinate circuit-phonon interactions that sped up the current. They trapped phonons of particular wavelengths (called modes) between two acoustic “mirrors,” which reflect sound, and the relatively long time sound takes to make a round trip allowed the precise coordination. The mirrors were a hair’s width apart—similar control of light would require mirrors separated by about 12 meters.
Sound’s “slowness” also let the experimenters identify phonons of more than one mode. Typically, Sletten says, quantum computers increase their capacity through additional superconducting qubits. But having just one qubit process information with multiple modes could achieve the same result.
“This is definitely a milestone,” says Yiwen Chu, a physicist at ETH Zurich, who was not involved in the study. Analogous experiments with light were a first step toward much of today’s work on quantum computers, she notes.
Similar applications for sound are far off, however: among other things, scientists must find a way to keep phonons alive much longer than they currently can—about 600 nanoseconds.

Seriously Though
Oxford quantum physicist Nikita Gourianov tore into the quantum computing industry this week, comparing the ""fanfare"" around the tech to a financial bubble in a searing commentary piece for the Financial Times.
In other words, he wrote, it's far more hype than substance.
It's a scathing, but also perhaps insightful, analysis of a burgeoning field that, at the very least, still has a lot to prove.
Cashing In
Despite billions of dollars being poured into quantum computing, Gourianov argues, the industry has yet to develop a single product that's actually capable of solving practical problems.
That means these firms are collecting orders of magnitude more in financing than they're able to earn in actual revenue — a growing bubble that could eventually burst.
""The little revenue they generate mostly comes from consulting missions aimed at teaching other companies about 'how quantum computers will help their business,'"" Gourianov wrote for the FT, ""as opposed to genuinely harnessing any advantages that quantum computers have over classical computers.""
Contemporary quantum computers are also ""so error-prone that any information one tries to process with them will almost instantly degenerate into noise,"" he wrote, which scientists have been trying to overcome for years.
Gourianov also took aim at other assumptions about the field, arguing that fears over quantum computers being able to crack even the securest of cryptographic schemes are overblown.
Notably, the piece comes just weeks after a group of researchers found that a conventional computer was indeed able to rival Google's Sycamore quantum computer, undermining the tech giant's 2019 claims of having achieved ""quantum supremacy.""
Pure Hype
Despite the industry's less-than-stellar results, investors are still funneling untold sums into quantum computing ventures.
""In essence, the quantum computing industry has yet to demonstrate any practical utility, despite the fanfare,"" Gourianov wrote. ""Why is then so much money flowing in? Well, it is mainly due to the fanfare.""
The money, he argues, is coming from investors who typically don't have ""any understanding of quantum physics,"" while ""taking senior positions in companies and focusing solely on generating fanfare.""
In short, Gourianov believes it's only a matter of time until the ""bubble will pop"" and the ""funding will dry up"" — at which point, it's already too late.";2515;['in0ivb4', 'in0ne7c', 'in0nm15', 'in0ocx5', 'in0of7j', 'in0q6k8', 'in0q78o', 'in0qn0i', 'in0r1yp', 'in0tkbm', 'in0wi3a', 'in0xwax', 'in0y01w', 'in0y94t', 'in13xyv', 'in176y2', 'in1a75l', 'in1btsd', 'in1d44a', 'in1d50u', 'in1et0b', 'in1kfvp', 'in1kgoc', 'in1l498', 'in1p6pj', 'in1thf6', 'in1wvi2', 'in1ybzw', 'in25a41', 'in25ggp', 'in2b13d', 'in2f5co', 'in2g4n0', 'in2hptd', 'in2pv15', 'in2rszg', 'in34u82', 'in3nv26', 'in45o8i', 'in6tt9z'];108;1;[1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0];[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.375, 0.5, 1.0, 0.125, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.625, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.0, 0.625, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5];0.43125;0.390625;0.46431232753395646;0.3089643739575811;17.25;15.625

In quantum mechanics it's possible for an event to be both, the cause and an effect of another one.""]";[nan];2012-10-02;;Quantum causal relations: A causes B causes A;"One of the most deeply rooted concepts in science and in our everyday life is causality; the idea that events in the present are caused by events in the past and, in turn, act as causes for what happens in the future. If an event A is a cause of an effect B, then B cannot be a cause of A. Now theoretical physicists from the University of Vienna and the Université Libre de Bruxelles have shown that in quantum mechanics it is possible to conceive situations in which a single event can be both, a cause and an effect of another one. The findings will be published this week in ""Nature Communications"".
Although it is still not known if such situations can be actually found in nature, the sheer possibility that they could exist may have far-reaching implications for the foundations of quantum mechanics, quantum gravity and quantum computing.
Causal relations: who influences whom
In everyday life and in classical physics, events are ordered in time: a cause can only influence an effect in its future not in its past. As a simple example, imagine a person, Alice, walking into a room and finding there a piece of paper. After reading what is written on the paper Alice erases the message and leaves her own message on the piece of paper. Another person, Bob, walks into the same room at some other time and does the same: he reads, erases and re-writes some message on the paper. If Bob enters the room after Alice, he will be able to read what she wrote; however Alice will not have a chance to know Bob's message. In this case, Alice's writing is the ""cause"" and what Bob reads the ""effect"". Each time the two repeat the procedure, only one will be able to read what the other wrote. Even if they don't have watches and don't know who enters the room first, they can deduce it by what they write and read on the paper. For example, Alice might write ""Alice was here today"", such that if Bob reads the message, he will know that he came to the room after her.
Quantum violation of causal order
As long as only the laws of classical physics are allowed, the order of events is fixed: either Bob or Alice is first to enter the room and leave a message for the other person. When quantum mechanics enters into play, however, the picture may change drastically. According to quantum mechanics, objects can lose their well-defined classical properties, such as e.g. a particle that can be at two different locations at the same time. In quantum physics this is called a ""superposition"". Now an international team of physicists led by Caslav Brukner from the University of Vienna have shown that even the causal order of events could be in such a superposition. If - in our example - Alice and Bob have a quantum system instead of an ordinary piece of paper to write their messages on, they can end up in a situation where each of them can read a part of the message written by the other. Effectively, one has a superposition of two situations: ""Alice enters the room first and leaves a message before Bob"" and ""Bob enters the room first and leaves a message before Alice"".
""Such a superposition, however, has not been considered in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics since the theory always assumes a definite causal order between events"", says Ognyan Oreshkov from the Université Libre de Bruxelles (formerly University of Vienna). ""But if we believe that quantum mechanics governs all phenomena, it is natural to expect that the order of events could also be indefinite, similarly to the location of a particle or its velocity"", adds Fabio Costa from the University of Vienna.
The work provides an important step towards understanding that definite causal order might not be a mandatory property of nature. ""The real challenge is finding out where in nature we should look for superpositions of causal orders"", explains Caslav Brukner from the Quantum Optics, Quantum Nanophysics, Quantum Information group of the University of Vienna.";3950;['c6h0u2s', 'c6h17lt', 'c6h18zp', 'c6h1xsx', 'c6h278t', 'c6h28jl', 'c6h2ex7', 'c6h2ozf', 'c6h2tnn', 'c6h333f', 'c6h3ags', 'c6h3gqh', 'c6h3i4f', 'c6h3nnn', 'c6h3pek', 'c6h45kc', 'c6h4l06', 'c6h4qnk', 'c6h4rux', 'c6h4sm4', 'c6h4z95', 'c6h67xx', 'c6h6ax5', 'c6h6bm9', 'c6h6ycc', 'c6h71rd', 'c6h7947', 'c6h7ay6', 'c6h7j6b', 'c6h7os8', 'c6h89hs', 'c6h8c6h', 'c6h8gev', 'c6h8mzx', 'c6h90sp', 'c6h94nj', 'c6haai4', 'c6hac5j', 'c6hbjb0', 'c6hiy46'];109;1;[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.875, 0.625, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5];0.45;0.471875;0.4879805323985784;0.2173841286179835;18.0;18.875

Entanglement is so weird that Einstein dubbed it ""spooky action at a distance."" It's a strange effect where one object gets connected to another so that even if they are separated by large distances, an action performed on one will affect the other. Entanglement usually occurs with subatomic particles, and was predicted by the theory of quantum mechanics, which governs the realm of the very small.
But now physicists have succeeded in entangling two macroscopic diamonds, demonstrating that quantum mechanical effects are not limited to the microscopic scale.
""I think it's an important step into a new regime of thinking about quantum phenomena,"" physicist Ian Walmsley of England's University of Oxford said.""That is, in this regime of the bigger world, room temperatures, ambient conditions. Although the phenomenon was expected to exist, actually being able to observe it in such a system we think is quite exciting."" [Twisted Physics: 7 Mind-Blowing Findings]
Another study recently used quantum entanglement to teleport bits of light from one place to another. And other researchers have succeeded in entangling macroscopic objects before, but they have generally been under special circumstances, prepared in special ways, and cooled to cryogenic temperatures. In the new achievement, the diamonds were large and not prepared in any special way, the researchers said.
""It's big enough you can see it,"" Walmsley told LiveScience of the diamonds.""They're sitting on the table, out in plain view. The laboratory isn't particularly cold or particularly hot, it's just your everyday room.""
Walmsley, along with a team of physicists led by Oxford graduate student Ka Chung Lee, accomplished this feat by entangling the vibration of two diamond crystals. To do so, the researchers set up an apparatus to send a laser pulse at both diamonds simultaneously. Sometimes, the laser light changed color, to a lower frequency, after hitting the diamonds. That told the scientists it had lost a bit of energy.
Because energy must be conserved in closed systems (where there's no input of outside energy), the researchers knew that the ""lost"" energy had been used in some way. In fact, the energy had been converted into vibrational motion for one of the diamonds (albeit motion that is too small to observe visually). However, the scientists had no way of knowing which diamond was vibrating.
Then, the researchers sent a second pulse of laser light through the now-vibrating system. This time, if the light emerged with a color of higher frequency, it meant it had gained the energy back by absorbing it from the diamond, stopping its vibration.
The scientists had set up two separate detectors to measure the laser light — one for each diamond.
If the two diamonds weren't entangled, the researchers would expect each detector to register a changed laser beam about 50 percent of the time. It's similar to tossing a coin, where random chance would lead to heads about half the time and tails the other half the time on average.
Instead, because the two diamonds were linked, they found that one detector measured the change every time, and the other detector never fired. The two diamonds, it seemed, were so connected they reacted as a single entity, rather than two individual objects.
""Recent advances in quantum control techniques have allowed entanglement to be observed for physical systems with increasing complexity and separation distance,"" University of Michigan physicist Luming Duan, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an accompanying essay in the same issue of Science.""Lee et al. take an important step in this direction by demonstrating entanglement between oscillation patterns of atoms—phonon modes—of two diamond samples of millimeter size at room temperature, separated by a macroscopic distance of about 15 cm.""
In addition to furthering scientists' understanding of entanglement, the research could help develop faster computers called photonic processors, relying on quantum effects, said Oxford physicist Michael Sprague, another team member on the project.
""The long-term goal is that if you can harness the power of quantum phenomena, you can potentially do things more efficiently than is currently possible,"" Sprague said.";4384;['c34g4xj', 'c34gtcg', 'c34gvnz', 'c34hwfq', 'c34i3qg', 'c34i7gk', 'c34i8bj', 'c34ihvy', 'c34insq', 'c34irfw', 'c34ivuc', 'c34ixw7', 'c34j12j', 'c34j4t1', 'c34j7d7', 'c34j9ch', 'c34jikj', 'c34jilh', 'c34jlru', 'c34jnel', 'c34jsiw', 'c34juvx', 'c34k250', 'c34k58j', 'c34kuju', 'c34kwxw', 'c34kzcn', 'c34l43g', 'c34l5db', 'c34lbth', 'c34lkoj', 'c34ln29', 'c34lnm5', 'c34mb94', 'c34mcro', 'c34mnfv', 'c34nx55', 'c34nzb8', 'c34q48v', 'c34xpcx'];103;1;[0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.875];0.3875;0.58125;0.47087020504593413;0.2570110649369011;15.5;23.25

Working from the company's R&D lab in Cambridge in the UK, the scientists demonstrated that they could transmit quantum bits (or qubits) over hundreds of kilometers of optical fiber without scrambling the fragile quantum data encoded in the particles, thanks to a new technology that stabilizes the environmental fluctuations occurring in the fiber.
This could go a long way in helping to create a next-generation quantum internet that scientists hope will one day span global distances.
The quantum internet, which will take the shape of a global network of quantum devices connected by long-distance quantum communication links, is expected to enable use-cases that are impossible with today's web applications. They range from generating virtually un-hackable communications, to creating clusters of inter-connected quantum devices that together could surpass the compute power of classical devices.
But in order to communicate, quantum devices need to send and receive qubits – tiny particles that exist in a special, but extremely fragile, quantum state. Finding the best way to transmit qubits without having them fall from their quantum state has got scientists around the world scratching their heads for many years.
One approach consists of shooting qubits down optical fibers that connect quantum devices. The method has been successful but is limited in scale: small changes in the environment, such as temperature fluctuations, cause the fibers to expand and contract, and risk messing with the qubits.
This is why experiments with optical fiber, until now, have typically been limited to a range of hundreds of kilometers; in other words, nowhere near enough to create the large-scale, global quantum internet dreamed up by scientists.
To tackle the instable conditions inside optical fibers, Toshiba's researchers developed a new technique called ""dual band stabilization"". The method sends two signals down the optical fiber at different wavelengths. The first wavelength is used to cancel out rapidly varying fluctuations, while the second wavelength, which is at the same wavelength as the qubits, is used for finer adjustments of the phase.
Put simply, the two wavelengths combine to cancel environmental fluctuations inside the fiber in real time, which according to Toshiba's researchers, enabled qubits to travel safely over 600 kilometers.
Already, the company's team has used the technology to trial one of the most well-known applications of quantum networks: quantum-based encryption.
Known as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), the protocol leverages quantum networks to create security keys that are impossible to hack, meaning that users can securely exchange confidential information, like bank statements or health records, over an untrusted communication channel such as the internet.
During a communication, QKD works by having one of the two parties encrypt a piece of data by encoding the cryptography key onto qubits and sending those qubits over to the other person thanks to a quantum network. Because of the laws of quantum mechanics, however, it is impossible for a spy to intercept the qubits without leaving a sign of eavesdropping that can be seen by the users – who, in turn, can take steps to protect the information.
Unlike classical cryptography, therefore, QKD does not rely on the mathematical complexity of solving security keys, but rather leverages the laws of physics. This means that even the most powerful computers would be unable to hack the qubits-based keys. It is easy to see why the idea is gathering the attention of players from all parts, ranging from financial institutions to intelligence agencies.
Toshiba's new technique to reduce fluctuations in optical fibers enabled the researchers to carry out QKD over a much larger distance than previously possible. ""This is a very exciting result,"" said Mirko Pittaluga, research scientist at Toshiba Europe. ""With the new techniques we have developed, further extensions of the communication distance for QKD are still possible and our solutions can also be applied to other quantum communications protocols and applications.""
When it comes to carrying out QKD using optical fiber, Toshiba's 600-kilometer mark is a record-breaker, which the company predicts will enable secure links to be created between cities like London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Dublin.
Other research groups, however, have focused on different methods to transmit qubits, which have enabled QKD to happen over even larger distances. Chinese scientists, for example, are using a mix of satellite-based transmissions communicating with optical fibers on the ground, and recently succeeded in carrying out QKD over a total distance of 4,600 kilometers.
Every approach has its pros and cons: using satellite technologies is more costly and could be harder to scale up. But one thing is certain: research groups in the UK, China and the US are experimenting at pace to make quantum networks become a reality.
Toshiba's research was partially funded by the EU, which is showing a keen interest in developing quantum communications. Meanwhile, China's latest five-year plan also allocates a special place for quantum networks; and the US recently published a blueprint laying out a step-by-step guide leading to the establishment of a global quantum internet.";5616;['h1i7tsd', 'h1iajng', 'h1iajtn', 'h1ighfy', 'h1ihgqr', 'h1ij80w', 'h1ikqf7', 'h1ima56', 'h1ipa9z', 'h1isl26', 'h1ixt21', 'h1izsxg', 'h1j1z55', 'h1j382d', 'h1j4pzq', 'h1jcj85', 'h1jebxt', 'h1jgchb', 'h1jlw9y', 'h1jm9dd', 'h1jpq2u', 'h1jscax', 'h1jtynf', 'h1jy9wz', 'h1k513y', 'h1k7p57', 'h1k8gcw', 'h1kj6lf', 'h1kqsyy', 'h1kr1nr', 'h1krdwo', 'h1krkq0', 'h1ksx2n', 'h1l1pj8', 'h1l5cex', 'h1l7o6v', 'h1lmpw4', 'h1lsrp1', 'h1mheg8', 'h1nl09i'];104;1;[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0];[0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.0, 0.5];0.3125;0.2375;0.4428247395979588;0.2861380785564899;12.5;9.5

It only works at night, but the technique sets a new distance record.'];[nan];2012-08-09;Matthew Francis;Open-air quantum teleportation performed across a 97km lake;"Sending signals through fiber optic cable is reliable and fast, but because of internal absorption and other effects, they will lose photons—which is a problem when the number of photons being sent is small. This is of particular concern in quantum networks, which typically involve a small number of entangled photons. Direct transmission through free space (vacuum or air) experiences less photon loss, but it's very difficult to align a distant receiver perfectly with the transmitter so that photons arrive at their destination.
A group in China has made significant progress toward solving that problem, via a high accuracy pointing and tracking system. Using this method, Juan Yin and colleagues performed quantum teleportation (copying of a quantum state) using multiple entangled photons through open air between two stations 97 kilometers apart across a lake. Additionally, they demonstrated entanglement between two receivers separated by 101.8km, transmitted by a station on an island roughly halfway between them.
Though the authors do not make this clear in the paper, their method is currently limited to nighttime communication. Nevertheless, their results achieved larger distances for multi-photon teleportation and three-point entanglement than before, and the tracking system used may even enable ground-to-satellite quantum communication—at least if it happens at night.
Quantum communication requires transmitting an arbitrary quantum state between two points, similar to how ordinary communication sends bits (voice or other data) across distances. However, a quantum state is a small amount of information, typically carried by a single photon, so many methods used in ordinary communication are out of the question (including broadcasting).
In fiber optic quantum networks, photon loss is large over significant distances, requiring the use of quantum repeaters. Point-to-point free-space transmission—either open-air or through the vacuum of space—is better, though larger distances allow the beam of photons to disperse. Atmospheric turbulence also contributes to photon loss in the air, with the losses increasing the farther the signal must travel.
One of the biggest challenges in point-to-point communication, however, is target acquisition by the transmitter and/or receiver. If the ground shifts slightly due to settling or tectonic activity, or atmospheric turbulence makes the receiver appear to move, the laser transmitting the signal can miss its target entirely. With few photons to spare in quantum communication, real-time tracking and acquisition is necessary. The researchers solved this problem using beacon lasers, bright beams that carry no information, but can be used to aim both transmitter and receiver, and wide-angle cameras.
As usual in quantum entanglement experiments, the group created entangled photons by stimulating a crystal with ultraviolet light. This produces a pair of photons with the same wavelength, but opposite (and unknown) polarization values. These entangled photons were subsequently sent to detectors, where their polarization quantum states were measured and compared. In the first experiment, one photon was sent 97km across Qinghai Lake (using a telescope to focus the beam), while the second was analyzed locally. Using these photons, the researchers copied the quantum state from the laboratory to the far station, achieving quantum teleportation over a much larger distance than previously obtained.
However, quantum communication sometimes also requires coordination between two distant receivers, so the researchers set up the transmitter on an island in the lake. The receivers were 51.2 and 52.2 km from the photon source respectively, on opposite shores of Qinghai lake, forming a triangle with the transmitter. The distance between the receivers—101.8km—was far enough to create a 3 microsecond delay between measurements of the photon polarization.
Given this setup, there was no possible way for the two receiving stations to communicate. Yet the photons they registered were correlated, indicating entanglement was maintained.
These experiments provide not only a proof of principle for free-space quantum communication, but also a means to test the foundations of quantum theory over larger distances than before. With very large detector separation, quantum entanglement experiments can help differentiate between standard and alternative interpretations of the quantum theory.
Though the long-distance aspect is promising, the fact that they set up on the shores of a lake (where no intervening obstacles exist) and that the experiment could only be performed successfully at night indicate its limitations. Author Yuao Chen told Ars via e-mail that they are working on solving the problem for daytime communication, but since the signal consists of single photons, it's not clear how this will work—the number of received photons fluctuated with the position of the Moon, so noise appeared to be a significant problem for them. Point-to-point communication will need to solve that problem as well before satellite-to-ground quantum networks are practical.";5146;['c5qjyq6', 'c5qnz3d', 'c5qoa7h', 'c5qor4l', 'c5qosn6', 'c5qoytf', 'c5qp6ha', 'c5qph1s', 'c5qphje', 'c5qpr3e', 'c5qpt51', 'c5qq3nh', 'c5qq7j9', 'c5qq9li', 'c5qqcxc', 'c5qqfaq', 'c5qqotd', 'c5qr3fc', 'c5qr98o', 'c5qrf4i', 'c5qrimg', 'c5qrkzh', 'c5qrpvz', 'c5qrx8q', 'c5qtdhu', 'c5qtmvr', 'c5qts62', 'c5quc1i', 'c5quesi', 'c5quicm', 'c5quxvw', 'c5qv93i', 'c5qvzfo', 'c5qwkcp', 'c5qx7lf', 'c5qxlfp', 'c5qxnuu', 'c5qy4th', 'c5qy4wa', 'c5qzfwp'];99;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0];[0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.39375;0.5875;0.4837596898254338;0.24717149916606487;15.75;23.5

Scientists measure a system's quantum state without collapsing its superposition""]";[nan];2012-10-03;"Author Fullname; Lisa Grossman";Quantum measurements leave Schrödinger's cat alive;"Schrödinger’s cat, the enduring icon of quantum mechanics, has been defied. By making constant but weak measurements of a quantum system, physicists have managed to probe a delicate quantum state without destroying it – the equivalent of taking a peek at Schrodinger’s metaphorical cat without killing it. The result should make it easier to handle systems such as quantum computers that exploit the exotic properties of the quantum world.
Quantum objects have the bizarre but useful property of being able to exist in multiple states at once, a phenomenon called superposition. Physicist Erwin Schrödinger illustrated the strange implications of superposition by imagining a cat in a box whose fate depends on a radioactive atom. Because the atom’s decay is governed by quantum mechanics – and so only takes a definite value when it is measured – the cat is, somehow, both dead and alive until the box is opened.
Superposition could, in theory, let quantum computers run calculations in parallel by holding information in quantum bits. Unlike ordinary bits, these qubits don’t take a value of 1 or 0, but instead exist as a mixture of the two, only settling on a definite value of 1 or 0 when measured.
But this ability to destroy superpositions simply by peeking at them makes systems that depend on this property fragile. That has been a stumbling block for would-be quantum computer scientists, who need quantum states to keep it together long enough to do calculations.
Gentle measurement
Researchers had suggested it should be possible, in principle, to make measurements that are “gentle” enough not to destroy the superposition. The idea was to measure something less direct than whether the bit is a 1 or a 0 – the equivalent of looking at Schrödinger’s cat through blurry glasses. This wouldn’t allow you to gain a “strong” piece of information – whether the cat was alive or dead – but you might be able to detect other properties.
Now, R. Vijay of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues have managed to create a working equivalent of those blurry glasses. “We only partially open the box,” says Vijay.
The team started with a tiny superconducting circuit commonly used as a qubit in quantum computers, and put it in a superposition by cycling its state between 0 and 1 so that it repeatedly hit all the possible mixtures of states.
Next, the team measured the frequency of this oscillation. This is inherently a weaker measurement than determining whether the bit took on the value of 1 or 0 at any point, so the thought was that it might be possible to do this without forcing the qubit to choose between a 1 or a 0. However, it also introduced a complication.
Quantum pacemaker
Even though the measurement was gentle enough not to destroy the quantum superposition, the measurement did randomly change the oscillation rate. This couldn’t be predicted, but the team was able to make the measurement very quickly, allowing the researchers to inject an equal but opposite change into the system that returned the qubit’s frequency to the value it would have had if it had not been measured at all.
This feedback is similar to what happens in a pacemaker: if the system drifts too far from the desired state, whether that’s a steady heartbeat or a superposition of ones and zeros, you can nudge it back towards where it should be.
Vijay’s team was not the first to come up with this idea of using feedback to probe a quantum system, but the limiting factor in the past had been that measurements weak enough to preserve the system gave signals too small to detect and correct, while bigger measurements introduced noise into the system that was too big to control.
Error correction
Vijay and colleagues used a new kind of amplifier that let them turn up the signal without contaminating it. They found that their qubit stayed in its oscillating state for the entire run of the experiment. That was only about a hundredth of a second – but, crucially, it meant that the qubit had survived the measuring process.
“This demonstration shows we are almost there, in terms of being able to implement quantum error controls,” Vijay says. Such controls could be used to prolong the superpositions of qubits in quantum computing, he says, by automatically nudging qubits that were about to collapse.
The result is not perfect, points out Howard Wiseman of Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, in an article accompanying the team’s paper. “But compared with the no-feedback result of complete unpredictability within several microseconds, the observed stabilization of the qubit’s cycling is a big step forward in the feedback control of an individual qubit.”";4682;['c6hpq6v', 'c6hr557', 'c6hr5lt', 'c6hsqcv', 'c6hsvzn', 'c6hswb8', 'c6ht1xt', 'c6ht9i3', 'c6hta69', 'c6htd0i', 'c6hthfi', 'c6htjvi', 'c6htqv5', 'c6htr6n', 'c6htx4z', 'c6htyc1', 'c6hu1z4', 'c6hu8o0', 'c6hu8pj', 'c6huam5', 'c6hucj2', 'c6hucjj', 'c6huht5', 'c6humai', 'c6hvxob', 'c6hw3fk', 'c6hw5o5', 'c6hwicv', 'c6hwjeu', 'c6hwk2f', 'c6hwy0q', 'c6hx1ek', 'c6hx7zw', 'c6hxvuh', 'c6hyq2t', 'c6hz4if', 'c6hz72i', 'c6i5ef9', 'c6i5ik7', 'c6ibc1a'];99;1;[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0];[0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.375];0.51875;0.45625;0.48537195788384807;0.2659740353869151;20.75;18.25

Scientists from Trinity College Dublin believe our brains could use quantum computation. Their discovery comes after they adapted an idea developed to prove the existence of quantum gravity to explore the human brain and its workings.
The brain functions measured were also correlated to short-term memory performance and conscious awareness, suggesting quantum processes are also part of cognitive and conscious brain functions.
If the team's results can be confirmed—likely requiring advanced multidisciplinary approaches—they would enhance our general understanding of how the brain works and potentially how it can be maintained or even healed. They may also help find innovative technologies and build even more advanced quantum computers.
Dr. Christian Kerskens, lead physicist at the Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience (TCIN), is the co-author of the research article that has just been published in the Journal of Physics Communications. He said, ""We adapted an idea, developed for experiments to prove the existence of quantum gravity, whereby you take known quantum systems, which interact with an unknown system. If the known systems entangle, then the unknown must be a quantum system, too. It circumvents the difficulties to find measuring devices for something we know nothing about.
""For our experiments we used proton spins of 'brain water' as the known system. 'Brain water' builds up naturally as fluid in our brains and the proton spins can be measured using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Then, by using a specific MRI design to seek entangled spins, we found MRI signals that resemble heartbeat evoked potentials, a form of EEG signals. EEGs measure electrical brain currents, which some people may recognize from personal experience or simply from watching hospital dramas on TV.""
Electrophysiological potentials like the heartbeat evoked potentials are normally not detectable with MRI and the scientists believe they could only observe them because the nuclear proton spins in the brain were entangled.
Dr. Kerskens added, ""If entanglement is the only possible explanation here then that would mean that brain processes must have interacted with the nuclear spins, mediating the entanglement between the nuclear spins. As a result, we can deduce that those brain functions must be quantum.
""Because these brain functions were also correlated to short-term memory performance and conscious awareness, it is likely that those quantum processes are an important part of our cognitive and conscious brain functions.
""Quantum brain processes could explain why we can still outperform supercomputers when it comes to unforeseen circumstances, decision making, or learning something new. Our experiments, performed only 50 meters away from the lecture theater where Schrödinger presented his famous thoughts about life, may shed light on the mysteries of biology, and on consciousness which scientifically is even harder to grasp.""";3015;['iszyxzm', 'it1fagk', 'it1r2pk', 'it1z70w', 'it1zsly', 'it20wsp', 'it2114c', 'it24tbo', 'it25lpf', 'it2k9ah', 'it2x0e2', 'it30oqe', 'it3426r', 'it356n7', 'it35ber', 'it35me1', 'it385br', 'it3bb6l', 'it3bey4', 'it3dp0x', 'it3i41e', 'it3ioh6', 'it3k4lz', 'it3q1mx', 'it42t25', 'it44uvd', 'it45ed3', 'it4hqk2', 'it4m69q', 'it4r54a', 'it4x139', 'it4zq82', 'it58qfm', 'it6220d', 'it6aqi6', 'it6l58b', 'it6qy5a', 'it838kx', 'it8gif1', 'itiw1ir'];99;1;[0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25];[0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.625, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.125, 0.875, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 1.0, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.3875;0.51875;0.4574043615882997;0.3119369928366945;15.5;20.75

Chinese scientists, some of whom were part of the founding team of QuantumCTeck, tested the quantum key distribution with the world's first quantum satellite Micius launched in August 2016.
Unlike traditional cryptography, the technology uses single photons in quantum superposition states by which the key is embedded to guarantee unconditional security between distant parties.
Quantum superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, stating that, much like waves in classical physics, any two or more quantum states can be added together.

A special form of light made using an ancient Namibian gemstone could be the key to new light-based quantum computers, which could solve long-held scientific mysteries, according to new research led by the University of St Andrews.
The research, conducted in collaboration with scientists at Harvard University in the US, Macquarie University in Australia and Aarhus University in Denmark and published in Nature Materials, used a naturally mined cuprous oxide (Cu2O) gemstone from Namibia to produce Rydberg polaritons, the largest hybrid particles of light and matter ever created.
Rydberg polaritons switch continually from light to matter and back again. In Rydberg polaritons, light and matter are like two sides of a coin, and the matter side is what makes polaritons interact with each other.
This interaction is crucial because this is what allows the creation of quantum simulators, a special type of quantum computer, where information is stored in quantum bits. These quantum bits, unlike the binary bits in classical computers that can only be 0 or 1, can take any value between 0 and 1. They can therefore store much more information and perform several processes simultaneously.
This capability could allow quantum simulators to solve important mysteries of physics, chemistry and biology, for example, how to make high-temperature superconductors for highspeed trains, how cheaper fertilizers could be made potentially solving global hunger, or how proteins fold making it easier to produce more effective drugs.
Project lead Dr. Hamid Ohadi, of the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, says that ""making a quantum simulator with light is the holy grail of science. We have taken a huge leap towards this by creating Rydberg polaritons, the key ingredient of it.""
To create Rydberg polaritons, the researchers trapped light between two highly reflective mirrors. A cuprous oxide crystal from a stone mined in Namibia was then thinned and polished to a 30-micrometer thick slab (thinner than a strand of human hair) and sandwiched between the two mirrors to make Rydberg polaritons 100 times larger than ever demonstrated before.
One of the leading authors Dr. Sai Kiran Rajendran, of the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, says that ""purchasing the stone on eBay was easy. The challenge was to make Rydberg polaritons that exist in an extremely narrow color range.""

A sudoku-style mathematical puzzle that is known to have no classical solution has been found to be soluble if the objects being arrayed in a square grid show quantum behavior [1]. The problem, posed by Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler in 1779, involves finding a way to arrange objects in a grid so that their properties don’t repeat in any row or column. The quantum solution might be useful for problems in quantum information processing, such as creating algorithms for correcting errors in quantum computing.
Euler imagined a group of 36 army officers, six from each of six regiments, with each officer having one of six different ranks. Can they be arranged in a square formation such that no regiment or rank is repeated in any row or column?
Solutions can be found for all squares ( , , and so on, assuming the appropriate number of officers) except for and Euler’s case of . In 1900, the impossibility of a solution was proven by the French mathematician Gaston Tarry. But Suhail Rather of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), Adam Burchardt of Jagiellonian University in Poland, and their colleagues wondered if the problem could be solved if the objects were quantum mechanical instead of classical. Then the objects could be placed in combinations (superpositions) of the various possible states: a single officer could be, say, partially a colonel from the red regiment and partially a lieutenant from the blue regiment.
This quantum version requires an adjusted definition of when two such states can be considered “different.” Quantum superpositions can be represented as vectors in the space of possible states of the components, and the team assumed that two superpositions are mutually exclusive if their vectors are perpendicular (orthogonal) to one another.
The researchers used a computer algorithm to search for such quantum solutions of Euler’s “36 officers” problem. They started from a classical configuration that had only a few repetitions in the rows and columns and tried to improve it by adding in superposition. They found that a full quantum solution to the problem exists for a particular set of superposition states.
A superposition between two quantum objects often implies that they are entangled: their properties are interdependent and correlated. If, say, one quantum officer is found (on inspection) to be a colonel, the other with which it is entangled might have to be a lieutenant. The quantum solution requires a complicated set of entanglements between officers, reminiscent of the entanglements created between quantum bits (qubits) in quantum computing.
The researchers realized that their solution is closely related to a problem in quantum information processing involving “absolutely maximally entangled” (AME) states, in which the correlation between any pair of entangled qubits in the group is as strong as it can possibly be. Such states are relevant to quantum error correction, where errors in a quantum computation must be identified and corrected without actually reading out the states of the qubits. AME states are also important in quantum teleportation, where the quantum state of one particle in an entangled pair is recreated in the other particle.
Qubits have two possible readout states, 0 and 1, but quantum objects can, in principle, also have three (qutrits) or more states. Theorists have derived mathematical expressions for AME states for different-sized groups of quantum objects, but an AME state for four six-state objects (so-called quhex objects, like quantum dice) has proven curiously elusive. Rather and colleagues found that their quantum solution to the Euler problem shows how to entangle four quantum dice to also produce this so-called AME(4,6) solution. The lack of an AME(4,6) state had been puzzling to theorists, but the solution required an approach that had not been previously considered. The result shows a new design principle for creating states with entangled particles, an essential element of error-correcting codes, says team member Arul Lakshminarayan of the IITM.
Finding the AME(4,6) state solves “a problem that has been investigated by several researchers within the last few years,” says quantum information theorist Barbara Kraus of the University of Innsbruck in Austria. Quantum technologist Hoi-Kwong Lo of the University of Toronto says the work is potentially significant. “The argument looks plausible to me, and if the result is correct, I think it is very important, with implications for quantum error correction.” But he admits that it’s not easy to understand intuitively why the six-state case turns out to be so special, both for Euler’s problem and for the AME states.";4747;['hyguxo3', 'hygx5f6', 'hygyeff', 'hyh8r99', 'hyh8x3b', 'hyhbaur', 'hyhd7ih', 'hyhff6d', 'hyhgxcf', 'hyhhoyx', 'hyhn24d', 'hyhp7bk', 'hyhq8mv', 'hyhr6po', 'hyhs889', 'hyhtrzz', 'hyhueyr', 'hyhw2l0', 'hyhx2yq', 'hyhxz12', 'hyhzu5s', 'hyi06ec', 'hyi0a0w', 'hyi0ptq', 'hyig4e8', 'hyigh2n', 'hyih9j6', 'hyilmkb', 'hyim4tv', 'hyiocgv', 'hyiq3r0', 'hyirikq', 'hyisp93', 'hyiyh3i', 'hyj0c75', 'hyj14p2', 'hyjevb3', 'hyjhghu', 'hyjstto', 'hyl5k9t'];97;1;[1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.325;0.48125;0.4227883631321941;0.17127737007555904;13.0;19.25

It harnesses the bizarro-world properties of quantum physics to ensure that information sent from point A to point B isn’t intercepted. The laws of physics dictate that nobody—not even the NSA—can measure a quantum system without disrupting it.
The problem, as Edward Snowden could probably tell you, is that quantum cryptography is still in its infancy. It only works over relatively short distances, and the required gear—including lasers and a dedicated fiber optic network—is prohibitively expensive, limiting its use to a handful of research labs, corporations and governments.
A new research paper from scientists at Toshiba brings quantum cryptography a baby-step closer to the masses. The paper, published today in Nature, explains how to expand a point-to-point quantum network with only two users into a “quantum access network” with up to 64 users.
“This kind of communication cannot be defeated by future advances in computing power, nor new mathematical algorithms, nor fancy new engineering,” said co-author Andrew Shields, head of the Quantum Information Group of Toshiba Research Europe. “As long as the laws of physics hold true, it will ensure that your communications are fully secured.”
A quantum network uses specially polarized photons to encode an encryption key—a very long series of numbers and letters that can unlock a digital file. The photons are then sent down a fiber optic cable until they reach their destination, a photon detector, which counts them, and delivers the key to the intended recipient. If the photons are interfered with, the individual packets of information are forever altered and the recipient can see the telltale signs of tampering.
The Toshiba team focused its efforts on improving the photon detector, and created a system that counts up to 1 billion photons per second, which makes it feasible to add more people to the network. “Our breakthrough is we’ve developed an architecture that is point-to-multipoint. This greatly increase the number of potential users in the network, and reduces costs,” Shields said.
Current quantum cryptography systems from companies like ID Quantique start at around $50,000, and only connect two parties at a time. “If up to 64 people can share a single photon detector than you can spread out those costs,” Shields said.
The next step toward mainstreaming quantum crypto is increasing the distance that photons can travel before they degrade—currently the record is 200 km (124 miles) using a dedicated fiber optic cable. But researchers are working on ways to transmit quantum bits on so-called “noisy” fiber that carries other information, which means that the day may not be far away when your Gmail may have a quantum key.

MELVIN was a machine-learning algorithm Krenn had built, a kind of artificial intelligence. Its job was to mix and match the building blocks of standard quantum experiments and find solutions to new problems. And it did find many interesting ones. But there was one that made no sense. “The first thing I thought was, ‘My program has a bug because the solution cannot exist,’” Krenn says.
MELVIN had seemingly solved the problem of creating highly complex entangled states involving multiple photons (entangled states being those that once made Albert Einstein invoke the specter of “spooky action at a distance”). Krenn, Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna and their colleagues had not explicitly provided MELVIN the rules needed to generate such complex states, yet it had found a way. Eventually Krenn realized that the algorithm had rediscovered a type of experimental arrangement that had been devised in the early 1990s. But those experiments had been much simpler. MELVIN had cracked a far more complex puzzle. “When we understood what was going on, we were immediately able to generalize [the solution],” says Krenn, who is now at the University of Toronto.
Since then, other teams have started performing the experiments identified by MELVIN, allowing them to test the conceptual underpinnings of quantum mechanics in new ways. Meanwhile Krenn, working with colleagues in Toronto, has refined their machine-learning algorithms. Their latest effort, an AI called THESEUS, has upped the ante: it is orders of magnitude faster than MELVIN, and humans can readily parse its output. While it would take Krenn and his colleagues days or even weeks to understand MELVIN’s meanderings, they can almost immediately figure out what THESEUS is saying. “It is amazing work,” says theoretical quantum physicist Renato Renner of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, who reviewed a 2020 study about THESEUS but was not directly involved in these efforts.
Krenn stumbled on this entire research program somewhat by accident when he and his colleagues were trying to figure out how to experimentally create quantum states of photons entangled in a very particular manner. When two photons interact, they become entangled, and both can be mathematically described only using a single shared quantum state. If you measure the state of one photon, the measurement instantly fixes the state of the other even if the two are kilometers apart (hence Einstein’s derisive comments on entanglement being “spooky”).
In 1989 three physicists—Daniel Greenberger, the late Michael Horne and Zeilinger—described an entangled state that came to be known as GHZ (after their initials). It involved four photons, each of which could be in a quantum superposition of, say, two states, 0 and 1 (a quantum state called a qubit). In their paper, the GHZ state involved entangling four qubits such that the entire system was in a two-dimensional quantum superposition of states 0000 and 1111. If you measured one of the photons and found it in state 0, the superposition would collapse, and the other photons would also be in state 0. The same went for state 1. In the late 1990s Zeilinger and his colleagues experimentally observed GHZ states using three qubits for the first time.
Krenn and his colleagues were aiming for GHZ states of higher dimensions. They wanted to work with three photons, where each photon had a dimensionality of three, meaning it could be in a superposition of three states: 0, 1 and 2. This quantum state is called a qutrit. The entanglement the team was after was a three-dimensional GHZ state that was a superposition of states 000, 111 and 222. Such states are important ingredients for secure quantum communications and faster quantum computing. In late 2013 the researchers spent weeks designing experiments on blackboards and doing the calculations to see if their setups could generate the required quantum states. But each time they failed. “I thought, ‘This is absolutely insane. Why can’t we come up with a setup?’” Krenn says.
To speed up the process, Krenn first wrote a computer program that took an experimental setup and calculated the output. Then he upgraded the program to allow it to incorporate in its calculations the same building blocks that experimenters use to create and manipulate photons on an optical bench: lasers, nonlinear crystals, beam splitters, phase shifters, holograms, and the like. The program searched through a large space of configurations by randomly mixing and matching the building blocks, performed the calculations and spat out the result. MELVIN was born. “Within a few hours the program found a solution that we scientists—three experimentalists and one theorist—could not come up with for months,” Krenn says. “That was a crazy day. I could not believe that it happened.” Then he gave MELVIN more smarts. Anytime it found a setup that did something useful, MELVIN added that setup to its toolbox. “The algorithm remembers that and tries to reuse it for more complex solutions,” Krenn says.
It was this more evolved MELVIN that left Krenn scratching his head in a Viennese café. He had set it running with an experimental toolbox that contained two crystals, each capable of generating a pair of photons entangled in three dimensions. Krenn’s naive expectation was that MELVIN would find configurations that combined these pairs of photons to create entangled states of at most nine dimensions. But “it actually found one solution, an extremely rare case, that has much higher entanglement than the rest of the states,” Krenn says.
Eventually he figured out that MELVIN had used a technique that multiple teams had developed nearly three decades ago. In 1991 Xin Yu Zou, Li Jun Wang and Leonard Mandel, all then at the University of Rochester, designed one method. And in 1994 Zeilinger, then at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, and his colleagues came up with another. Conceptually these experiments attempted something similar, but the configuration that Zeilinger and his colleagues devised is simpler to understand. It starts with one crystal that generates a pair of photons (A and B). The paths of these photons go right through another crystal, which can also generate two photons (C and D). The paths of photon A from the first crystal and of photon C from the second overlap exactly and lead to the same detector. If that detector clicks, it is impossible to tell whether the photon originated from the first or the second crystal. The same goes for photons B and D.
A phase shifter is a device that effectively increases the path a photon travels as some fraction of its wavelength. If you were to introduce a phase shifter in one of the paths between the crystals and kept changing the amount of phase shift, you could cause constructive and destructive interference at the detectors. For example, each of the crystals could be generating, say, 1,000 pairs of photons per second. With constructive interference, the detectors would register 4,000 pairs of photons per second. And with destructive interference, they would detect none: the system as a whole would not create any photons even though individual crystals would be generating 1,000 pairs a second. “That is actually quite crazy, when you think about it,” Krenn says.
MELVIN’s funky solution involved such overlapping paths. What had flummoxed Krenn was that the algorithm had only two crystals in its toolbox. And instead of using those crystals at the beginning of the experimental setup, it had wedged them inside an interferometer (a device that splits the path of, say, a photon into two and then recombines them). After much effort, he realized that the setup MELVIN had found was equivalent to one involving more than two crystals, each generating pairs of photons, such that their paths to the detectors overlapped. The configuration could be used to generate high-dimensional entangled states.
Quantum physicist Nora Tischler, who was a Ph.D. student working with Zeilinger on an unrelated topic when MELVIN was being put through its paces, was paying attention to these developments. “It was kind of clear from the beginning [that such an] experiment wouldn’t exist if it hadn’t been discovered by an algorithm,” she says.
Besides generating complex entangled states, the setup using more than two crystals with overlapping paths can be employed to perform a generalized form of Zeilinger’s 1994 quantum interference experiments with two crystals. Aephraim Steinberg, an experimentalist who is a Toronto colleague of Krenn’s but has not worked on these projects, is impressed by what the AI found. “This is a generalization that (to my knowledge) no human dreamed up in the intervening decades and might never have done,” he says. “It’s a gorgeous first example of the kind of new explorations these thinking machines can take us on.”
In one such generalized configuration with four crystals, each generating a pair of photons, and overlapping paths leading to four detectors, quantum interference can create situations where either all four detectors click (constructive interference) or none of them do so (destructive interference). Until recently, carrying out such an experiment had remained a distant dream. Then, in a March preprint paper, a team led by Lan-Tian Feng of the University of Science and Technology of China, in collaboration with Krenn, reported that they had fabricated the entire setup on a single photonic chip and performed the experiment. The researchers collected data for more than 16 hours: a feat made possible because of the photonic chip’s incredible optical stability, something that would have been impossible to achieve in a larger-scale tabletop experiment. For starters, the setup would require a square meter’s worth of optical elements precisely aligned on an optical bench, Steinberg says. Besides, “a single optical element jittering or drifting by a thousandth of the diameter of a human hair during those 16 hours could be enough to wash out the effect,” he says.
During their early attempts to simplify and generalize what MELVIN had found, Krenn and his colleagues realized that the solution resembled abstract mathematical forms called graphs, which contain vertices and edges and are used to depict pairwise relations between objects. For these quantum experiments, every path a photon takes is represented by a vertex. And a crystal, for example, is represented by an edge connecting two vertices. MELVIN first produced such a graph and then performed a mathematical operation on it. The operation, called perfect matching, involves generating an equivalent graph in which each vertex is connected to only one edge. This process makes calculating the final quantum state much easier, although it is still hard for humans to understand.
That changed with MELVIN’s successor THESEUS, which generates much simpler graphs by winnowing the first complex graph representing a solution that it finds down to the bare minimum number of edges and vertices (such that any further deletion destroys the setup’s ability to generate the desired quantum states). Such graphs are simpler than MELVIN’s perfect matching graphs, so it is even easier to make sense of any AI-generated solution. Renner is particularly impressed by THESEUS’s human-interpretable outputs. “The solution is designed in such a way that the number of connections in the graph is minimized,” he says. “And that’s naturally a solution we can better understand than if you had a very complex graph.”
Eric Cavalcanti of Griffith University in Australia is both impressed by the work and circumspect about it. “These machine-learning techniques represent an interesting development.

The research revealed that the protein fulfills several predictions of one of the leading quantum-based theories for how avian magnetoreception might work.'];[nan];2021-06-24;Catherine Offord;New Study Fuels Debate About Source of Birds’ Magnetic Sense;"A protein found in robins’ eyes has all the hallmarks of a magnetoreceptor and could help birds navigate using the Earth’s magnetic fields, according to a study published today (June 23) in Nature. The research, an intensive in vitro analysis of robin cryptochrome 4 (Cry4), revealed that the protein is magnetically sensitive and fulfills several predictions of one of the leading quantum-based theories for how avian magnetoreception might work.
The authors of the study argue that their findings support Cry4 as the likely receptor for birds’ still largely mysterious magnetic sense. But some other researchers who spoke to The Scientist say that while the results are extremely useful for understanding cryptochromes, a family of proteins often studied in circadian rhythms, the paper omits some scientific context for its findings and doesn’t necessarily support Cry4 as the elusive magnetoreceptor.
“It’s a very important step to show that this cryptochrome 4 actually can perceive light and then become magnetically sensitive,” says Rachel Muheim, a zoologist and magnetoreception researcher at Lund University in Sweden who was not involved in this work. She says that in her view Cry4 has already emerged in the wider literature as the most likely candidate in avian navigation, but “there are a number of experiments that can’t be explained” by the mechanism the new study focuses on and that aren’t addressed in the paper, she adds. “There’s a lot of unanswered questions.”
Many animals use the Earth’s magnetic fields to help them navigate, but scientists have long debated the biological mechanisms underpinning this sixth sense, with repeated accusations of irreproducible findings and sometimes heated debates between different research groups.
The cryptochrome theory of magnetoreception is based on quantum mechanics. Cryptochromes are light-sensitive flavoproteins found in the retinas of birds and several other groups of animals, and they’re known to form a pair of radicals—molecules with unpaired electrons—when exposed to light. These electrons have correlated spins, and theoretical and in vitro work indicate that their states can be influenced by magnetic fields, leading to the hypothesis that cryptochrome proteins could provide the basis for animal magnetoreception.
At least four cryptochromes (Cry1a, Cry1b, Cry2, and Cry4) have been found in birds’ eyes to date. While some groups have focused their attention on Cry1a, University of Oxford chemist Peter Hore, a coauthor on the new study, tells The Scientist that he and his colleagues at Oxford and at the University of Oldenburg in Germany view Cry4 as the more likely candidate. Unlike some of the other avian cryptochromes, Hore says, Cry4 binds to a particular molecule needed to help it absorb light and undergo the sort of photochemistry necessary to sense magnetic fields.
In our view, the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to Cry4 being the hottest candidate.—Henrik Mouritsen, University of Oldenburg
“Also, the other cryptochromes in birds show a 24-hour rhythm in their expression, consistent with their involvement in circadian regulation, whereas the Cry4 doesn’t—but it does show a seasonal variation, which the others don’t,” he adds. “That could be consistent with the need to migrate in spring and autumn.”
To explore the idea further, the team isolated Cry4 from European robins (Erithacus rubecula) that migrate at night when skies are dim, though not completely dark, and studied the protein in vitro using various techniques, including computer simulations and several types of spectroscopy that can measure how magnetic fields affect protein photochemistry. The researchers also created mutant versions of the protein to figure out the role of individual amino acids in Cry4’s sensitivity to magnetic fields.
They showed that Cry4 generates radical pairs in a light-dependent reaction by having electrons hop along a string of tryptophan amino acids, and that these pairs are highly sensitive to magnetic fields. What’s more, compared to robin Cry4, the same cryptochrome isolated from chickens and pigeons—two nonmigratory birds—were a lot less sensitive to magnetic fields, suggesting that robin Cry4 might be particularly specialized for magnetoreception, the authors write in their paper.
David Keays of Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich who was not involved in the work says that the findings do seem to support Cry4’s role in magnetoreception, and adds that the study is consistent with his own group’s research on the protein’s sensing of magnetic fields. He notes that the magnetic fields used in the study were stronger than those generated by the Earth. “The authors see a clear magnetic effect when applying 10-30mT fields to CRY4 in test tubes,” he adds in an email. “[W]hether the same applies to Earth strength fields (50uT) in a migrating bird is an open question.”
Alex Jones, a specialist in photochemistry and magnetic field effects at the UK’s National Physical Laboratory who was not involved in the study, says that the data and the authors’ interpretation of the results as they relate to the protein’s behavior are “very solid.” Regarding the strength of the magnetic fields used, he adds that “the radical pair mechanism predicts effects at both weaker and stronger fields, and starting from exposure to stronger fields makes sense from an experimental point of view.”
Debate about existing behavioral data
Margaret Ahmad, a photobiologist at Sorbonne Université in Paris who helped discover cryptochromes in the early 1990s while working on Arabidopsis plants and was not involved in the current work, says that while the researchers “did a tremendous job” of providing valuable data on Cry4, she finds their conclusions about avian navigation unsupported and contrary to existing data from experiments in animal behavior.
“It’s not scientifically admissible to relate [this Cry4 mechanism] to magnetosensing in view of the behavioral evidence that contradicts any role” for it in avian magnetoreception, says Ahmad, who has previously debated with Hore’s group in the literature about the functions of other cryptochrome proteins in plants.
One of the points of contention is the fact that the particular radical pair mechanism described in the new paper is known not to work under green light. Yet Muheim and others have reported from behavioral experiments that robins and other birds are in fact capable of orienting just fine under green light, although there is an ongoing discussion in the field about whether these findings could partly be due to the light conditions birds were exposed to before being tested.
Hore says that it’s unclear how Cry4 fits into this literature at the moment. “I’m not sure what to make of that,” he says. “Maybe the photochemistry is more complicated than we think—it could certainly be different in vivo.”
Ahmad also points to research by veteran magnetoreception researchers Roswitha Wiltschko and Wolfgang Wiltschko, who carried out orientation experiments using flickering lights and changing magnetic fields. The pair concluded that robins’ magnetosensor worked even in complete darkness. This typically isn’t the sort of condition that robins would navigate under, but the findings led the researchers to propose that it’s a different, light-independent radical pair reaction in cryptochrome that’s important for magnetoreception.
My personal sense is that we’re a little beyond just looking at one end of this, at just the physical chemistry, or just the birds.—Thorsten Ritz, University of California, Irvine
These points weren’t discussed in the paper, Ahmad notes. “Why would you ignore this [data in your paper]? You have to fit your model into the existing behavioral data,” she says. “If I wasn’t in the field at all, I would get the idea that ‘Ah! The bird magnetoreceptor, we’ve got it!’”
The Wiltschkos, who are based at Goethe University Frankfurt and have collaborated with Ahmad and Hore on various occasions, have argued that Cry4’s position in the eye—associated with oil droplets that block the types of light needed to activate the protein—also make Cry4 an unlikely candidate. In an email sent to The Scientist, Roswitha Wiltschko highlights many of the same points as Ahmad, and notes that she favors Cry1a, “which is found in [photoreceptors that] contain clear oil droplet that let all wavelengths pass,” as the likely magnetoreceptor in birds.
She also adds that “the avian magnetic compass is not at all restricted to migratory birds. [In] particular homing pigeons and chickens have been demonstrated to use a magnetic compass; hence we would not expect them to be poorer equipped.”
The University of Oldenburg’s Henrik Mouritsen, a coauthor on the new study, says that his group has tried to replicate a number of different studies of magnetoreception by the Wiltschkos and other groups without success. “If we cannot replicate certain claims, we cannot really refer to those things as facts, because we cannot see that—and we have also published that we cannot see that.”
He agrees that the team’s current study doesn’t provide conclusive proof that Cry4 is the magnetoreceptor in robins, but adds that in combination with the rest of the literature (excluding papers his group has concluded are irreproducible), “in our view, the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to Cry4 being the hottest candidate.”
He emphasizes that the protein’s behavior in vitro matches up very well with theoretical predictions about magnetoreception. “I would say that it is astounding if what we measure in this molecule is just a coincidence,” he adds. “[I] think that the claim that what we have measured is unlikely to have anything to do with magnetic sensing in birds is . . . unwarranted.”
A better link between in vitro and in vivo
Thorsten Ritz, a physicist at the University of California, Irvine, who helped develop the original cryptochrome radical pair model of avian magnetoreception more than 20 years ago and was one of the reviewers on the new paper, which was submitted in mid-2019, tells The Scientist that while detailed descriptions of the proteins that are potentially involved are extremely important, “my personal sense is that we’re a little beyond just looking at one end of this, at just the physical chemistry, or just the birds—that’s how we started 50 years ago in this field.” Researchers should be working on developing new experimental systems that allow them to study everything from sensing a magnetic field through to some kind of phenotypic effect, he adds.
Hore says that although it’s challenging to do in vivo experiments with purported magnetoreceptors, it might be possible to inhibit Cry4 function in birds’ eyes and study the importance of the protein’s magnetosensitivity in vivo. He adds that the team is now working with mutant cryptochrome proteins to understand what makes robin Cry4 particularly sensitive to magnetic fields compared to chicken or pigeon cryptochrome.
They’re also interested in the role of a tyrosine amino acid that sits at the end of the tryptophan chain. “I think that could be quite important for the mechanism of sensing and signaling,” says Hore. “I’d like to find a way to make the in vitro experiments mimic the situation in vivo more closely to see if we can get evidence for the involvement of that tyrosine.”";11375;['h332hab', 'h33bvvm', 'h33cu8n', 'h33en65', 'h33f30b', 'h33fw9s', 'h33g052', 'h33h85l', 'h33j5wm', 'h33kjmy', 'h33lzso', 'h33ob6v', 'h33perb', 'h33pou6', 'h33qd47', 'h33qw1w', 'h33tqu0', 'h33vd5x', 'h33vf39', 'h33y7m6', 'h33yu2n', 'h33zu20', 'h3414bk', 'h3414c3', 'h3426m4', 'h342tbq', 'h347ai5', 'h34eruk', 'h34gszy', 'h34hbtp', 'h34ivzl', 'h34jmrz', 'h34kmdb', 'h34ku2j', 'h34mtuo', 'h34yevb', 'h34zlqk', 'h351hq8', 'h35fxm1', 'h36rhrp'];92;1;[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 1.0, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.375, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5];0.375;0.53125;0.45414755311462374;0.19515618744994995;15.0;21.25

IBM said the Q System One was ""Europe's most powerful quantum computer in the industrial context.""
The quantum computer is to be housed in Ehningen, which is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of Stuttgart. It will be operated by Germany's Fraunhofer research institute. It is the company's first quantum computer in use outside of the US.
'Miracle of technology'
Regular modern computers process functions in a binary fashion, carrying out tasks that use fragments of data that are only ever a 1 or 0. Quantum computers use subatomic particles to perform calculations at far greater speeds than existing supercomputers, and data can be both a 1 and 0 at the same time. The data fragments on a quantum computer, known as qubits (short for ""quantum bits""), significantly boost its computing power.
The machine is housed in a 9-foot (2.7 meter) tall glass cube to shield the qubits from noise and other physical disturbances, to which they can be sensitive.
Companies hope to harness the power of quantum computers to potentially develop new materials, medications or artificial intelligence (AI).
The computer has been running since February, but its launch event was postponed as a result of the pandemic.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who holds a PhD in quantum chemistry from her time as a scientist in former East Germany, called the computer a ""miracle of technology.”
Speaking via video, Merkel said it could play ""a key role in our efforts for technological and digital sovereignty, and of course for economic growth.""
Looking to the future
The German government announced last month that it planned to invest some €2 billion ($2.4 billion) in quantum technology research by 2025.
The Fraunhofer institute said it would work with German companies and other research organizations to use the quantum computer to deepen its understanding of quantum computing and experiment with practical uses.
The project, funded by German taxpayers, will cost about €40 million over the next four years.
The European Commission wants the European Union to develop its first quantum computer before the end of the decade.

I've already posted Q&As with two fellow speakers I shared housing with: biologist Rupert Sheldrake, who urges scientists to take telepathy more seriously; and physicist George Ellis, who deplores the philosophical philistinism of some fellow physicists. Below is my Q&A with another housemate, physicist Carlo Rovelli of Aix-Marseille University and the Intitut Universitaire de France. I interviewed Rovelli by phone in the early 1990s when I was writing a story for Scientific American about loop quantum gravity, a quantum-mechanical version of gravity proposed by Rovelli, Lee Smolin and Abhay Ashtekar. (General relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, is notoriously difficult to reconcile with quantum mechanics.) I was thrilled to meet Rovelli face to face, especially since he turned out to be, like Sheldrake and Ellis, a good as well as smart guy. Rovelli is the author of a leading textbook on quantum gravity and a biography about the ancient Greek philosopher Anaximander (discussed below). For more on Rovelli's views on physics and philosophy, see this 2012 conversation with him on Edge.org.
Horgan: Why did you become a physicist?
Rovelli: I was young in the sixties and seventies, and shared the dream of my generation: changing the world and make it more just and gentle. We lost. I did not know what to do next. I found physics, where, instead, revolutions succeed. I got in love with it. It has been a passion that hasn't ended.
Horgan: Has physics lived up to your expectations?
Rovelli: It has been much better than I expected. Infinite fun and enthusiasm. Investigating the secrets of the world. Thinking things that nobody else has thought before. Great adventures in thinking. Great companions of travel. Fantastic.
Horgan: What is loop quantum gravity?
Rovelli: It is, in my humble opinion, the best tentative theory of quantum gravity we have at present. We do not know if it is right. But we know there is a problem, and this is the best possible solution found so far for this problem.
Horgan: Is it still a viable contender as a unified theory?
Rovelli: ""Unified theory"" generally means a theory that unifies all forces and all fields: a ""theory of everything."" Loop quantum gravity doesn't have anything to do with this. [Horgan note: LQG doesn't include electromagnetism or the nuclear forces.] I think that for the moment we know nothing about a ""unified theory"" and the attempts to write it are by far premature and ill conceived. So, LQG is not a contender as a unified theory. Much more humbly, it is just a tentative solution for a simpler problem: describing the quantum aspects of gravity. Which is to say the quantum aspects of spacetime. This is hard enough. But it is a problem that we have chances to solve, because we have the ingredients.
Horgan: Do multiverse theories and quantum gravity theories deserve to be taken seriously if they cannot be falsified?
Rovelli: No.
Horgan: Do you ever think it's time for physicists to abandon the quest for a unified theory?
Rovelli: The ""quest for a unified theory"" is a misconception. Physicists never really searched for it. They stumbled upon string theory, which to some appeared as a possible unification of everything, and, for lack of imagination, put too much energy into strings. When the enthusiasm for strings begun to fade, many felt lost. Now that supersymmetry is not showing up where string theorists expected it, it is a disarray.
Horgan: Can physics—or science in general—ever completely solve the mystery of the universe?
Rovelli: What is the ""mystery of the universe""? There isn't a ""mystery of the universe."" There is an ocean of things we do not know. Many of them we'll figure out, if we continue to be somewhat rational and do not kill one another first (which is well possible.) There will always be plenty of things that we will not understand, I think, but what do I know? In any case, we are very very very far from any complete comprehension of everything we would like to know.
Horgan: Can science attain absolute truth?
Rovelli: I have no idea what ""absolute truth"" means. I think that science is the attitude of those who find funny the people saying they know something is absolute truth. Science is the awareness that our knowledge is constantly uncertain. What I know is that there are plenty of things that science does not understand yet. And science is the best tool found so far for reaching reasonably reliable knowledge.
Horgan: What's your opinion of the recent philosophy-bashing by Stephen Hawking, Lawrence Krauss and Neil deGrasse Tyson?
Rovelli: Seriously: I think they are stupid in this. I have admiration for them in other things, but here they have gone really wrong. Look: Einstein, Heisenberg, Newton, Bohr.... and many many others of the greatest scientists of all times, much greater than the names you mention, of course, read philosophy, learned from philosophy, and could have never done the great science they did without the input they got from philosophy, as they claimed repeatedly. You see: the scientists that talk philosophy down are simply superficial: they have a philosophy (usually some ill-digested mixture of Popper and Kuhn) and think that this is the ""true"" philosophy, and do not realize that this has limitations.
Here is an example: theoretical physics has not done great in the last decades. Why? Well, one of the reasons, I think, is that it got trapped in a wrong philosophy: the idea that you can make progress by guessing new theory and disregarding the qualitative content of previous theories. This is the physics of the ""why not?"" Why not studying this theory, or the other? Why not another dimension, another field, another universe? Science has never advanced in this manner in the past. Science does not advance by guessing. It advances by new data or by a deep investigation of the content and the apparent contradictions of previous empirically successful theories. Quite remarkably, the best piece of physics done by the three people you mention is Hawking's black-hole radiation, which is exactly this. But most of current theoretical physics is not of this sort. Why? Largely because of the philosophical superficiality of the current bunch of scientists.
Horgan: You have written about the Greek thinker Anaximander. Who was he, and why do you find him interesting?
Rovelli: He is the guy who understood that the Earth is a stone that floats in the middle of the Sky without falling down. He understood that the Sky is not just above out head: it is also under our feet. It surrounds us in every direction. He is the only one in the history of our planet who understood this, and convinced everybody else that this is the case. In fact, he has done much more than this, but this is his greatest achievement. I find him immensely interesting because he represents one of the main steps in the development of scientific thinking. He is a giant.
Horgan: Do you agree with philosopher Thomas Nagel that science needs a new paradigm to account for the emergence of life and consciousness in the cosmos?
Rovelli: No. When we do not understand something, people are tempted to think that ""some new paradigm"" is needed, or a ""great mystery"" is there. Then we understand it, and all fog dissolves.
Horgan: Do you believe in God?
Rovelli: No. But perhaps I should qualify the answer, because like this it is bit too rude and simplistic. I do not understand what ""to believe in God"" means. The people that ""believe in God"" seem like Martians to me. I do not understand them. I suppose this means that I ""do not believe in God"". If the question is whether I think that there is a person who has created Heavens and Earth, and responds to our prayers, then definitely my answer is no, with much certainty.
If the question is whether I believe that ""God"" is a powerful something in the people, which causes a lot of disasters but also a lot of good, then of course I believe it. In fact, I am extremely curious about religion. I think that we should study what is religion much more than what is done. There is a sort of taboo in this, a sort of respect towards people who ""believe in God"", which makes it difficult to understand better.
I think that viewing the ""belief in God"" just as a bunch of silly superstitions is wrong. The ""belief in God"" is one form of human religious attitude, and human religious attitude is something very general and universal about our functioning. Something which is important for man, and we have not yet understood.
Horgan: Are science and religion compatible?
Rovelli: Of course yes: you can be great in solving Maxwell's equations and pray to God in the evening. But there is an unavoidable clash between science and certain religions, especially some forms of Christianity and Islam, those that pretend to be repositories of ""absolute Truths."" The problem is not that scientists think they know everything. It is the opposite: scientists know that there are things we simply do not know, and naturally question those who pretend to know. Many religious people are disturbed by this, and have difficulty in coping with it. The religious person says, ""I know that God has created light saying, 'Fiat Lux.'"" The scientist does not believe the story. The religious people feel threatened. And here the clash develops. But not all religions are like that. Many forms of Buddhism, for instance, have no difficulty with the continual critical attitude of science. Monotheistic religions, and in particular Islam and Christianity, are sometimes less intelligent.
I have an idea about the source of the conflict: there is beautiful research by anthropologists in Australia which shows that religious beliefs are often considered a-temporal but in reality change continuously and adapt to new conditions, new knowledge and so on. This was discovered by comparing religious beliefs held by native Australians studied by anthropologists in the thirties and, much later, in the seventies. So, in a natural situation, religious beliefs adapt to the change in man's culture and knowledge. The problem with Islam and Christianity is that many centuries ago somebody had the idea of writing down beliefs. So now some religious people are stuck with the culture and knowledge of centuries ago. They are fish trapped in a pond of old water.
Horgan: Have you ever accepted money from a military organization?
Rovelli: No. In my country military service was compulsory when I was a young man. I refused to join the army and was briefly detained for this.
Horgan: Do you think physicists—and scientists in general--have a moral responsibility to oppose militarism?
Rovelli: I think that we have a moral responsibility to oppose war as human beings, not as physicists or scientists. I think that the problem is that everybody ""opposes the war"" in words, but then many people are ready to make exceptions to serve their interests, defend their power and economical superiority. And these people hide this behind ""feel good"" words like ""help people"" or ""fight terrorism"". I found this morally disgusting. I wish people were less religious and more moral .
Horgan: In 2002 I bet physicist Michio Kaku $1,000 that by 2020 ""no one will have won a Nobel Prize for work on superstring theory, membrane theory, or some other unified theory describing all the forces of nature.” Who do you think is going to win? [Horgan note: Lee Smolin was originally going to bet against me but backed out at the last minute, the big chicken.]
Rovelli: You. No doubt.
Postscript from Horgan: In the comments section, you can see that Carlo Rovelli posts responses to some early comments on his remarks. I'm copying his responses here for easier access.
A few answers from carlo rovelli:
- to “lakefield”: I actually loved these questions: finally general questions allowing ideas to be expressed, instead of the common boring technicalities.
- to “pupplesan”: I think what you do in your post about the “hard problem of consciousness is not characterising it, but rather anticipating a possible answer. Which might be right. Or not.
- to “Strangelove”: Yes, Archimedes and Eudoxus are also giants. Establishing ranking is not of much interest, I think. I had the misfortune that my US publisher chose the title “The First Scientist” for my book on Anaximander, raising a silly priority debate. I meant bringing attention to Anaximander’s wonderful achievements, not to open an empty discussions about who is greatest or the first! More on the substance of your post, I agree that the key is being testable, which is the main thing you say. But I think that the picture of science as “random guesses” then tested is not a good picture. The “guesses” that have a good chance of being later confirmed are those that have ground. Your example about the spherical Earth is very good: there had been a long sequence of observations, arguments and rational thinking (An example in Aristotle’s ‘On the Heavens’ is the round shade of the Earth on the Moon during lunar eclipses) that provided very strong plausibility to the idea. I think that a problem of today’s theoretical physics is the difficulty of appreciating the difference between a “random guess” and a “well motivated guess”.
- to “ZoranOstric”. You ask about a way to overcome this separation. I think a good starting point could be simply physicists stoping talking philosophy down. For centuries scientists were cultured people, who knew the main philosophical ideas of the past, knew well the history of science, and were very curious about the philosophers of their own times. Yes, I do think that knowing what people in analytical philosophy do now would be useful. There are many thinker in analytical philosophy nowadays that I have found very interesting for a physics (Butterfield, Price, Earman, Norton, Dorato, van Fraassen, Bitbol, Halvorson, Brown, Wuthrich, Myrvold, Ismael, Weinstein, Sauders… just to name a few at random). An example: people talking about “other worlds existing” could usefully read John Austin and David Lewis, at least to avoid using “exist” so superficially…
- to ""cshbar"", who asks: 'how [my] favored theory can be falsified?' Good question. Thanks. Answers in several steps:(i) In principle, Loop Quantum Gravity gives specific quantitative predictions, for instance regarding the possible values of the area of any surface, or cross section. Any measurement of a cross section that does not enter the set of the values predicted by theory falsifies the theory. (ii) These predictions are pretty general, and the situation is very different from string theory, which has zillions of vacua each with a different set of predictions, or multiuniverses, where it is not even very clear what a 'prediction' is going to be.(iii) In practice, it is difficult to test predictions, because the Planck length is small.(iv) But the claim of LQG is simple, and low key: it is not a theory we try to sell as the final theory of everything that everybody should buy; we present it is a tentative theory whose physical viability we ourselves we are far from sure about, until some empirical support comes in.(v) As for myself, predictions and testing the theory is what I am consider interesting and what I am working on. This is why I am trying to use the theory to compute the probability of black holes tunnelling into white holes, with the hope to see signals of this process in cosmic rays, and get hard testing. So, the short answer is: LQG is developed with the idea that what cannot be tested empirically is not good science.";15756;['cjxfedi', 'cjxfsl3', 'cjxg0aj', 'cjxg867', 'cjxgd37', 'cjxgff9', 'cjxgo8u', 'cjxj1kw', 'cjxj94x', 'cjxjypf', 'cjxlvly', 'cjxms8y', 'cjxnof5', 'cjxot6k', 'cjxp7zy', 'cjxq0f3', 'cjxq5gj', 'cjxsux9', 'cjxtpm2', 'cjxv0vw', 'cjxzh4j', 'cjxzxzw', 'cjy0iwx', 'cjy1pgd', 'cjy3cmt', 'cjy49d3', 'cjy4zj1', 'cjy6bgf', 'cjy6p9g', 'cjy70mx', 'cjy7mnn', 'cjy7taj', 'cjy8ee9', 'cjy8i5r', 'cjy8ru8', 'cjyagw0', 'cjybqot', 'cjyc90l', 'cjycty4', 'cjzu1p5'];44;1;[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.0, 0.875, 0.25, 0.25, 0.875, 0.875, 0.5, 0.0, 0.375, 0.125, 0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.75, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5];0.4125;0.45625;0.47285700798444347;0.2262983373778959;16.5;18.25

Google believes that this quantum computer, called Bristlecone, will be able to bring us to an age of quantum supremacy.
Ready For Quantum Supremacy
Google has teased before that it would build a 49-qubit quantum computer to achieve “quantum supremacy.” This achievement would show that quantum computers can perform some well-defined science problems faster than the fastest supercomputers in the world can.
In a recent announcement, Google said:
If a quantum processor can be operated with low enough error, it would be able to outperform a classical supercomputer on a well-defined computer science problem, an achievement known as quantum supremacy. These random circuits must be large in both number of qubits as well as computational length (depth). Although no one has achieved this goal yet, we calculate quantum supremacy can be comfortably demonstrated with 49 qubits, a circuit depth exceeding 40, and a two-qubit error below 0.5%. We believe the experimental demonstration of a quantum processor outperforming a supercomputer would be a watershed moment for our field, and remains one of our key objectives.
Not long after Google started talking about its 49-qubit quantum computer, IBM showed that for some specific quantum applications, 56 qubits or more may be needed to prove quantum supremacy. It seems Google wanted to remove all doubt, so now it’s experimenting with a 72-qubit quantum computer.
Don’t let the numbers fool you, though. Right now, the most powerful supercomputers can simulate only 46 qubits and for every new qubit that needs to be simulated, the memory requirements typically double (although some system-wide efficiency can be gained with new innovations).
Therefore, in order for us to simulate a 72-qubit quantum computer, we’d need millions of times more RAM (2^(72-46)). We probably won’t be able to use that much RAM in a supercomputer anytime soon, so if Bristlecone will be able to run any algorithm faster than our most powerful supercomputers, then the quantum supremacy era will have arrived.
High Number Of Qubits Is Not Enough
A high number of qubits is not the only thing that’s needed to achieve quantum supremacy. You also need qubits with low error rates so they don’t mess-up the calculations. A useful quantum computer is a function of both number of qubits and error rate.
According to Google, a minimum error rate for quantum computers needs to be in the range of less than 1%, coupled with close to 100 qubits. Google seems to have achieved this so far with 72-qubit Bristlecone and its 1% error rate for readout, 0.1% for single-qubit gates, and 0.6% for two-qubit gates.
Quantum computers will begin to become highly useful in solving real-world problems when we can achieve error rates of 0.1-1% coupled with hundreds of thousand to millions of qubits.
According to Google, an ideal quantum computer would have at least hundreds of millions of qubits and an error rate lower than 0.01%. That may take several decades to achieve, even if we assume a “Moore’s Law” of some kind for quantum computers (which so far seems to exist, seeing the progress of both Google and IBM in the past few years, as well as D-Wave).
That said, we may start seeing some ""useful"" applications of quantum computers well before that. For instance, breaking most existing cryptography may be possible when the quantum computers have only a few thousand qubits. If the current rate of progress for quantum computers holds, we may be able to reach that in about a decade.
Google is “cautiously optimistic” that the Bristlecone quantum computer will not only achieve quantum supremacy, but could also be used as a testbed for researching qubit scalability and error rates, as well as applications such as simulation, optimization, and machine learning.";3936;['dv8al0f', 'dv8li93', 'dv8mhxr', 'dv8ncil', 'dv8nh9a', 'dv8pnjl', 'dv8pwq8', 'dv8qfrx', 'dv8rub0', 'dv8tj25', 'dv8ughg', 'dv8vemv', 'dv8xrlf', 'dv8yvwz', 'dv8yzbr', 'dv8zslq', 'dv8zz1m', 'dv9031g', 'dv90rqz', 'dv91thx', 'dv91we3', 'dv92hfu', 'dv93r3c', 'dv94clp', 'dv964vg', 'dv9999p', 'dv99jqv', 'dv9gktu', 'dv9hpe5', 'dv9i2mi', 'dv9ign5', 'dv9ii63', 'dv9iqjo', 'dv9ksbs', 'dv9my5h', 'dv9pysj', 'dv9utx2', 'dv9wbnf', 'dvatttn', 'dvd72ck'];88;1;[0.75, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];[0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.125, 0.0, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5];0.4375;0.421875;0.4498263553861645;0.2818569839031845;17.5;16.875

Teleporting fundamental states between photons – massless particles of light – is quickly becoming old news, a trick we are still learning to exploit in computing and encrypted communications technology.
But what the latest research has achieved is quantum teleportation between particles of matter – electrons –something that could help connect quantum computing with the more traditional electronic kind.
""We provide evidence for 'entanglement swapping,' in which we create entanglement between two electrons even though the particles never interact, and 'quantum gate teleportation,' a potentially useful technique for quantum computing using teleportation,"" says physicist John Nichol from the University of Rochester in New York.
""Our work shows that this can be done even without photons.""
Entanglement is physics jargon for what seems like a pretty straightforward concept.
If you buy a pair of shoes from a shop and leave one behind, you'll automatically know which foot it belongs to the moment you get home. The shoes are – in a manner of speaking – entangled.
If the shopkeeper randomly pulls out its matching partner when you return, you'll think they either remembered your sale, made a lucky guess, or were perhaps a little 'spooky' in their prediction.
The real weirdness arises when we imagine your lonely shoe as being both left and right at the same time, at least until you look at it. At that very moment, the shoe's partner back at the shop also snaps into shape, as if your sneaky peek teleported across that distance.
It's a kind of serendipitous exchange that Einstein felt was a little too spooky for comfort. Nearly a century after physicists raised the possibility, we now know teleportation between entangled particles is how the Universe works on a fundamental level.
While it's not exactly a Star Trek-type teleportation that could beam whole objects across space, the mathematics describing this information jump are mighty useful in carrying out special kinds of calculations in computing.
Typical computer logic is made up of a binary language of bits, labelled either 1s and 0s. Quantum computing is built with qubits that can occupy both states at once – providing far greater possibilities that classical technology can't touch.
The problem is the Universe is like a big jumble of shoes, all threatening to turn your delicate game of 'guess which foot' into a nightmare gamble the moment any qubit interacts with its environment.
Manipulating photons to transmit their entangled states is made easier thanks to the fact they can be quickly separated at light speed over huge distances through a vacuum or down an optical fibre.
But separating entangled masses – such as pairs of electrons – is more of a challenge, given their clunky interactions as they bounce along are almost certain to ruin their mathematically pure quantum state.
It's a challenge well worth the effort, though.
""Individual electrons are promising qubits because they interact very easily with each other, and individual electron qubits in semiconductors are also scalable,"" says Nichol.
""Reliably creating long-distance interactions between electrons is essential for quantum computing.""
To achieve it, the team of physicists and engineers took advantage of some strange fine print in the laws that govern the ways the fundamental particles making up atoms and molecules hold their place.
Any two electrons that share the same quantum spin state can't occupy the same spot in space. But there is a bit of a loophole that says nearby electrons can swap their spins, almost as if your feet could swap shoes if you bring them close enough.
The researchers had previously shown that this exchange can be manipulated without needing to move the electrons at all, presenting a potential method for teleportation.
This latest advance helps bring the process closer to technological reality, overcoming hurdles that would connect quantum weirdness with existing computing technology.
""We provide evidence for 'entanglement swapping,' in which we create entanglement between two electrons even though the particles never interact, and 'quantum gate teleportation,' a potentially useful technique for quantum computing using teleportation,"" says Nichol.

Of course, we're still some way off replacing photons with electrons for this kind of quantum information transfer. The researchers haven't gone as far as measuring the states of electrons themselves, meaning there could still be all kinds of interference to iron out.

This is the essence of the Fermi Paradox, a question that has plagued astronomers and cosmologists almost since the birth of modern astronomy.
It is also the reasoning behind the Hart-Tipler Conjecture, one of the many (many!) proposed resolutions, which asserts that if advanced life had emerged in our galaxy sometime in the past, we would see signs of their activity everywhere we looked. Possible indications include self-replicating probes, megastructures, and other Type III-like activity.
On the other hand, several proposed resolutions challenge the notion that advanced life would operate on such massive scales. Others suggest that advanced extraterrestrial civilizations would be engaged in activities and locales that would make them less noticeable.
This makes sense from a computing standpoint and offers an explanation for the apparent lack of activity we see when we look at the cosmos.
The research was conducted by Gia Dvali, a theoretical physicist with the Max Planck Institute for Physics and the physics chair at Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich, and Zaza Osmanov, a professor of physics at the Free University of Tbilisi, and a researcher with the Kharadze Georgian National Astrophysical Observatory and the SETI Institute.
The paper that describes their findings recently appeared online and is being reviewed for publication in the International Journal of Astrobiology.
The first SETI survey (Project Ozma) was conducted in 1960 and was led by famed astrophysicist Dr. Frank Drake (who proposed the Drake Equation). This survey relied on the Green Bank Observatory's 26-meter (85-foot) radio telescope to listen for radio transmissions from the nearby star systems of Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani.
Since then, the vast majority of SETI projects have been geared towards the search for radio technosignatures, owing to the ability of radio waves to propagate through interstellar space. As Dvali and Osmanov explained to Universe Today via email:
""Currently, we are mainly looking for radio messages, and there have been several attempts to study the sky for finding the so-called Dyson sphere candidates – megastructures built around stars. On the other hand, the problem of SETI is so complex that one should test all possible channels.
""A whole ""spectrum"" of technosignatures might be much wider: for instance, the infrared or optical emission from megastructures also built around pulsars, white dwarfs, and black holes. A completely new ""direction"" must be the search for an anomalous spectral variability of these technosignatures, which might distinguish them from normal astrophysical objects.""
For many researchers, this limited focus is one of the main reasons SETI has failed to find any evidence of technosignatures. In recent years, astronomers and astrophysicists have recommended extending the search by looking for other technosignatures and methods – such as Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI).
These include directed energy (lasers), neutrino emissions, quantum communications, and gravitational waves, many of which are spelled out in the NASA Technosignature Report (released in 2018) and at the TechnoClimes 2020 workshop.
For their study, Dvali and Osmanov suggest looking for something altogether different: evidence of large-scale quantum computing. The benefits of quantum computing are well-documented, which include the ability to process information exponentially faster than digital computing and being immune to decryption.
Given the rate at which quantum computing is advancing today, it is entirely logical to assume that an advanced civilization could adapt this technology to a much grander scale. Said Dvali and Osmanov:
""No matter how advanced is a civilization or how different is their particle composition and chemistry from ours, we are unified by laws of quantum physics and gravity. These laws tell us that the most efficient storers of quantum information are black holes.
""Although our recent studies show that theoretically, there may exist devices created by non-gravitational interactions that also saturate the capacity of information storage (so-called ""saturons""), the black holes are the clear champions. Correspondingly, any sufficiently advanced ETI is expected to use them for information storage and processing.""
This idea builds on the work of Nobel-prize winner Roger Penrose, who famously proposed that limitless energy could be extracted from a black hole by tapping into the ergosphere. This space lies just outside the event horizon, where infalling matter forms a disk that is accelerated to near the speed of light and emits tremendous amounts of radiation.
Several researchers have suggested that this may be the ultimate power source for advanced ETIs, either by feeding matter onto an SMBH (and harnessing the resulting radiation) or simply harnessing the energy they already put out.
Two possibilities for this latter scenario involve harnessing the angular momentum of their accretions disks (the ""Penrose Process"") or capturing the heat and energy generated by their hypervelocity jets (perhaps in the form of a Dyson Sphere).
In their later paper, Dvali and Osamov suggest that black holes could be the ultimate source of computation. This is based on the notions that: a) a civilization's advancement is directly correlated to its level of computational performance, and b) that there exist certain universal markers of computational advancement which can be used as potential technosignatures
for SETI.
Using the principles of quantum mechanics, Dvali and Osomanov explained how black holes would be the most efficient capacitors for quantum information. These black holes would likely be artificial in nature and micro-sized rather than large and naturally occurring (for the sake of computing efficiency).
As a result, they argue, these black holes would be more energetic than naturally-occurring ones:
""By analyzing the simple scaling properties of information retrieval time, we showed that the optimization of the information volume and processing time suggests that it is maximally beneficial for ETI to invest energy in the creation of many microscopic black holes as opposed to a few large ones.
""First, the micro-black holes radiate with much higher intensity and in the higher energy spectrum of Hawking radiation. Secondly, such black holes must be manufactured by means of high-energy particle collisions in accelerators. This manufacturing necessarily provides an accompanying high-energy radiation signature.""
Hawking radiation, named in honor of the late and great Stephen Hawking, is theorized to be released just outside the event horizon of a black hole due to relativistic quantum effects. The emission of this radiation reduces the mass and rotational energy of black holes, theoretically resulting in their eventual evaporation.
The resulting Hawking radiation, said Dvali and Osomanov, would be ""democratic"" in nature, meaning that it would produce many different species of subatomic particles that are detectable by modern instruments:
""The great thing about Hawking radiation is that it is universal in all the existing particle species. Thereby, ETI quantum computers must radiate ""ordinary"" particles such as neutrinos and photons. Neutrinos, in particular, are excellent messengers due to their extraordinary penetration ability, which avoids the possibility of screening.
""This, in particular, offers novel fingerprints of ETI in the form of a flux of very high energy neutrinos coming both from Hawking radiation of information storing micro black holes as well as from the collision 'factories' that manufacture them. The Hawking component of radiation is expected to be a superposition of black body spectra of very high energies.
""In the paper, we have shown that the IceCube observatory can potentially observe such technosignatures. However, this is just one potential example of a very exciting new direction for SETI.""
In many respects, this theory echoes the logic of the Barrow Scale, proposed by astrophysicist and mathematician John D. Barrow in 1998. A revision of the Kardashev Scale, the Barrow Scale suggests that civilizations should be characterized not by their physical mastery of outer space (i.e., planet, solar system, galaxy, etc.) but of inner space – i.e., the molecular, atomic, and quantum realms.
This Scale is central to the Transcension Hypothesis, a proposed resolution to Fermi's Paradox that suggests that ETIs would have ""transcended"" beyond anything we would recognize.
Herein lies another exciting aspect of this theory, which is how it offers another possible resolution to the Fermi Paradox. As they explained:
""Up until now, we have completely overlooked a natural direction for SETI in form of high energy neutrinos and other particles produced by the Hawking radiation of artificial black holes. Thereby, various experimental searches for such high energy particles can potentially shed an extremely important light on the presence of advanced ETI within the observable part of the Universe.""
In short, it could be that we see a ""Great Silence"" when we look into the cosmos because we've been looking for the wrong technosignatures.
After all, if extraterrestrial life has had a jump on humanity (which seems reasonable given the age of the Universe), it stands to reason they would have outgrown radio communications and digital computing a long time ago. Another advantage to this theory is that it need not apply to all ETIs to explain why we haven't heard from any civilizations to date.
Given the exponential rate at which computing progresses (using humanity as a template), advanced civilizations might have a short window in which they broadcast in radio wavelengths. This is a key part of the Drake Equation: the L parameter, which refers to the length of time civilizations have to release detectable signals into space.
In the meantime, this study offers another potential technosignature for SETI surveys to look for in the coming years. The Paradox persists, but we need only find one indication of advanced life to resolve it.";10252;['j8hvwor', 'j8iacxl', 'j8id6hv', 'j8ig1dd', 'j8j0xha', 'j8j0zhe', 'j8j1fbd', 'j8j2skt', 'j8jecpr', 'j8jf13k', 'j8jf9f2', 'j8jfi7f', 'j8jw8sc', 'j8k23az', 'j8k39zy', 'j8kiog3', 'j8kkf1e', 'j8kkflq', 'j8ky4fu', 'j8kzyb9', 'j8l34kt', 'j8l8bz8', 'j8lapwp', 'j8ldi8m', 'j8ln5ij', 'j8lojtx', 'j8lsiel', 'j8lx850', 'j8lydub', 'j8lz5co', 'j8m18d3', 'j8m8r8n', 'j8m9fzq', 'j8md131', 'j8mklru', 'j8mqks6', 'j8muwo1', 'j8n8z3l', 'j8q0hq1', 'j8qo5c6'];86;1;[0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0];0.275;0.45;0.41003048667141817;0.32210246816812815;11.0;18.0

Quantum mechanics boasts all sorts of strange features, one being quantum superposition – the peculiar circumstance in which particles seem to be in two or more places or states at once. Now, an international group of physicists led by Stevens Institute of Technology, University of Vienna and University of Queensland flip that description on its head, showing that particles are not the only objects that can exist in a state of superposition – so can time itself.
“The sequence of events can become quantum mechanical,” said co-author Igor Pikovski, a physicist at the Center for Quantum Science and Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology. “ We looked at quantum temporal order where there is no distinction between one event causing the other or vice versa. So at the same time, A can cause B and B can cause A, in a quantum loop that blurs the lines of cause and effect.”
The work, reported in the August 22 issue of Nature Communications, is among the first to reveal the quantum properties of time, whereby the flow of time doesn’t observe a straight arrow forward, but one where cause and effect can co-exist both in the forward and backward direction. In the upcoming era of quantum computers, the work holds particular promise: quantum computers that exploit the quantum order of performing operations might beat devices that operate using only fixed sequences.
Pikovski and colleagues merged two seemingly conflicting theories – quantum mechanics and general relativity – to conduct a Gedanken experiment, a way of using the imagination to investigate the nature of things. The team, consisting of Pikovski, Magdalena Zych, Fabio Costa and Caslav Brukner, started by asking the question, “what would a clock measure if it was influenced by a massive object in a quantum superposition state, i.e. both near and far at the same time?”
According to general relativity, the presence of a massive object slows down the flow of time, such that a clock placed close to a massive object will run slower compared to an identical one that is farther away.
Based on that observation, the Gedanken experiment goes like this: imagine a pair of starships training for a mission. They are asked to fire at each other at a specified time and dodge the fire at another time, whereby each ship knows the exact time when to fire and when to dodge. If either ship fires too early, one will destroy the other, establishing an unmistakable time order between the firing events. That is, starship A fires before starship B, and starship A survives and starship B is destroyed.
However, if a powerful agent could place a sufficiently massive object, say a planet, closer to one starship it would slow down its flow of time. As a result, the starship would be in line of fire of the attack and be destroyed.
Quantum mechanics complicates the matter. When placing the planet in a state of superposition near one starship or the other, both can be destroyed or survive at the same time. The sequence of events exists in a state of superposition, such that each starship simultaneously destroys the other as two separate events, llustrating for the first time how this quantum scenario can occur and how it can be verified.
“Moving planets around is hard,” said Pikovski. “But imagining it helped us examine a quantum aspect of time that was previously unknown.”

The quantum computer has the potential to revolutionize the 21st century, solving problems so massively complex they would baffle today’s computers. But a single quantum computer is still no match for the more than billion classical computers currently in use. Quantum computers need a quantum internet, and researchers may just have found the perfect — and practical — material to built that network.
A team at the Australian National University details this big challenge facing dreamers who want to create a quantum internet in a paper published Monday in Nature Physics.
How can one store quantum information in a way that can be transmitted across the planet? Being able to keep quantum bits, or qubits, entangled over tens of thousands of miles is a huge challenge, considering it’s only recently that researchers were able to move beyond a few meters.
But it is more an engineering problem than a theoretical one, and their work suggests a crystal treated with the element erbium just might be the answer. These crystals allowed the researchers to store quantum information successfully for 1.3 seconds.
That may not sound like much, but it’s actually a whopping 10,000 times longer than what has been accomplished before. And when you consider information traveling at the speed of light needs far less than a second to travel around the world, 1.3 seconds is already long enough to start thinking about a global quantum internet.
Erbium is a common enough element found in fluorescent lights, older-model televisions, and lasers. It’s already used in existing fiber optic networks because it naturally operates at the right wavelength to greatly boost communication signals.
It turns out the same principle can work for a quantum communications network. Using erbium-treated crystals means there would be no need to build an entirely new network, as the researchers say quantum information transmitted by using such crystals would be compatible with the planet’s existing telecommunications system.
Any other material than erbium would operate at a different wavelength, meaning a quantum internet would need to convert qubits from wavelength to another and then back again as part of any transmission, which makes an already fiendishly complicated challenge a nearly impossible one.

A paper being published in a US physics journal suggests it may be possible to view ""cracks"" in the universe that would support the theory of ""quantum graphity"", considered to be the holy grail of physics.
The team of researchers from the University of Melbourne and RMIT say that instead of thinking of the start of the universe as being a big bang, we should imagine it as a cooling of water into ice.
""Think of the early universe as being like a liquid,"" Melbourne University theoretical physics researcher James Quach said.
""Then as the universe cools, it `crystalises'.
""The reason we use the water analogy is water is without form.
""In the beginning there wasn't even space, space did not exist because there was no form.""
Their research rests on a school of thought that has emerged recently to suggest space is made of indivisible building blocks, like atoms, that can be thought of as similar to pixels that make up images on a computer screen.
Mr Quach says the standing model for the origins of the universe, the big bang, needs to be rewritten.
He hopes experimentalists will be able to find evidence to support the theory put forward by the Melbourne team of researchers, that would replace it.
""The biggest problem with the big bang model is the bang itself,"" Mr Quach says.
""At the bang, physics breaks down.

Scientists from MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology), Moscow Pedagogical State University and the University of Manchester have created a highly sensitive terahertz detector based on the effect of quantum-mechanical tunneling in graphene. The sensitivity of the device is already superior to commercially available analogs based on semiconductors and superconductors, which opens up prospects for applications of the graphene detector in wireless communications, security systems, radio astronomy, and medical diagnostics. The research results are published in Nature Communications.
Information transfer in wireless networks is based on transformation of a high-frequency continuous electromagnetic wave into a discrete sequence of bits. This technique is known as signal modulation. To transfer the bits faster, one has to increase the modulation frequency. However, this requires synchronous increase in carrier frequency. A common FM-radio transmits at frequencies of a hundred megahertz, a Wi-Fi receiver uses signals of roughly five gigahertz frequency, while the 5G mobile networks can transmit up to 20 gigahertz signals. This is far from the limit, and further increase in carrier frequency admits a proportional increase in data transfer rates. Unfortunately, picking up signals with hundred gigahertz frequencies and higher is an increasingly challenging problem.
A typical receiver used in wireless communications consists of a transistor-based amplifier of weak signals and a demodulator that rectifies the sequence of bits from the modulated signal. This scheme originated in the age of radio and television, and becomes inefficient at frequencies of hundreds of gigahertz desirable for mobile systems. The fact is that most of the existing transistors aren't fast enough to recharge at such a high frequency.
An evolutionary way to solve this problem is just to increase the maximum operation frequency of a transistor. Most specialists in the area of nanoelectronics work hard in this direction. A revolutionary way to solve the problem was theoretically proposed in the beginning of 1990's by physicists Michael Dyakonov and Michael Shur, and realized, among others, by the group of authors in 2018. It implies abandoning active amplification by transistor, and abandoning a separate demodulator. What's left in the circuit is a single transistor, but its role is now different. It transforms a modulated signal into bit sequence or voice signal by itself, due to non-linear relation between its current and voltage drop.
In the present work, the authors have proved that the detection of a terahertz signal is very efficient in the so-called tunneling field-effect transistor. To understand its work, one can just recall the principle of an electromechanical relay, where the passage of current through control contacts leads to a mechanical connection between two conductors and, hence, to the emergence of current. In a tunneling transistor, applying voltage to the control contact (termed as ''gate'') leads to alignment of the energy levels of the source and channel. This also leads to the flow of current. A distinctive feature of a tunneling transistor is its very strong sensitivity to control voltage. Even a small ""detuning"" of energy levels is enough to interrupt the subtle process of quantum mechanical tunneling. Similarly, a small voltage at the control gate is able to ""connect"" the levels and initiate the tunneling current.
""The idea of strong reaction of a tunneling transistor to low voltages is known for about fifteen years,"" says Dr. Dmitry Svintsov, one of the authors of the study, head of the laboratory for optoelectronics of two-dimensional materials at the MIPT center for photonics and 2-D materials. ""But it's been known only in the community of low-power electronics. No one realized before us that the same property of a tunneling transistor can be applied in the technology of terahertz detectors. Georgy Alymov (co-author of the study) and I were lucky to work in both areas. We realized then: if the transistor is opened and closed at a low power of the control signal, then it should also be good in picking up weak signals from the ambient surrounding. ""
The created device is based on bilayer graphene, a unique material in which the position of energy levels (more strictly, the band structure) can be controlled using an electric voltage. This allowed the authors to switch between classical transport and quantum tunneling transport within a single device, with just a change in the polarities of the voltage at the control contacts. This possibility is of extreme importance for an accurate comparison of the detecting ability of a classical and quantum tunneling transistor.
The experiment showed that the sensitivity of the device in the tunneling mode is few orders of magnitude higher than that in the classical transport mode. The minimum signal distinguishable by the detector against the noisy background already competes with that of commercially available superconducting and semiconductor bolometers. However, this is not the limit—the sensitivity of the detector can be further increased in 'cleaner' devices with a low concentration of residual impurities. The developed detection theory, tested by the experiment, shows that the sensitivity of the optimal detector can be a hundred times higher.
""The current characteristics give rise to great hopes for the creation of fast and sensitive detectors for wireless communications,"" says the author of the work, Dr. Denis Bandurin. And this area is not limited to graphene and is not limited to tunnel transistors. We expect that, with the same success, a remarkable detector can be created, for example, based on an electrically controlled phase transition. Graphene turned out to be just a good launching pad here, just a door, behind which is a whole world of exciting new research.""
The results presented in this paper are an example of a successful collaboration between several research groups. The authors note that it is this format of work that allows them to obtain world-class scientific results. For example, earlier, the same team of scientists demonstrated how waves in the electron sea of graphene can contribute to the development of terahertz technology. ""In an era of rapidly evolving technology, it is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve competitive results,"" comments Dr. Georgy Fedorov, deputy head of the nanocarbon materials laboratory, MIPT, ""Only by combining the efforts and expertise of several groups can we successfully realize the most difficult tasks and achieve the most ambitious goals, which we will continue to do.""";6774;['gm3zmda', 'gm413hh', 'gm41tuv', 'gm42tyl', 'gm43peo', 'gm47kiy', 'gm48f3e', 'gm4aq6i', 'gm4bako', 'gm4df1b', 'gm4hftf', 'gm4hna7', 'gm4iwji', 'gm4jn31', 'gm4ktz8', 'gm4uun5', 'gm4ymgc', 'gm5103e', 'gm52yxe', 'gm55b6i', 'gm56f2m', 'gm5llc3', 'gm5p5eu', 'gm5sccc', 'gm5vdxk', 'gm5wjbh', 'gm626qr', 'gm63t62', 'gm66nol', 'gm6a20q', 'gm6c218', 'gm6ct1q', 'gm6kvgz', 'gm73l2k', 'gm777ig', 'gm77yy9', 'gm7pikl', 'gm7xl5k', 'gm8ot5o', 'gmbtove'];75;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.375, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.14375;0.50625;0.3106822130409142;0.1995111212439046;5.75;20.25

Absolutely, according to a new experiment carried out between satellites in orbit and a station on the ground.
The team of scientists was able to exchange several carefully managed photons in pulses of infrared light, carried between Russian GLONASS satellites and the Space Geodesy Centre on the ground run by the Italian Space Agency.
Getting these signals to pass through some 20,000 kilometres (12,427 miles) of air and space without any interference or data loss is no easy task – but the signs are promising that such a global network could indeed be functional.
""Space quantum communications (QC) represent a promising way to guarantee unconditional security for satellite-to-ground and inter-satellite optical links, by using quantum information protocols as quantum key distribution (QKD),"" says one of the researchers, Giuseppe Vallone from the University of Padova in Italy.
The quantum key distribution or QKD method Vallone mentions refers to data encrypted using the power of quantum mechanics: thanks to the delicate nature of the technology, any interference is quickly detected, making QKD communications impossible to intercept.
In fact, hacking into a quantum mechanics message would cause it to self-destruct.
So far so good in theory, but keeping these secure channels open across long distances has proved tricky.
The key to the successful data exchange here was the use of passive retro-reflectors mounted on the satellites to keep the long-distance light signals intact, breaking the previous record distance for this type of quantum communication by an extra 15,000 kilometres (9,321 miles).
While satellites placed higher in orbit, like the GLONASS ones, are more difficult to communicate reliably with, they pass within sight of ground stations more regularly, potentially enabling an unhackable quantum network that can span the globe.
We're only just getting started with this type of technology – not least because scientists are still trying to figure out if it can actually work – and for the moment it's not clear exactly what a quantum internet would be used for or how it might be operated.
One idea is that it might become a specialised, very secure extension to the normal internet, used by a small selection of apps and devices.
What we do now know is that quantum communications are possible between the ground and high orbit satellites, extending the potential reach of the new technology.
That's important as the satellite networks we rely on continue to get developed and upgraded.
""Satellite-based technologies enable a wide range of civil, scientific and military applications like communications, navigation and timing, remote sensing, meteorology, reconnaissance, search and rescue, space exploration and astronomy,"" says Vallone.
""The core of these systems is to safely transmit information and data from orbiting satellites to ground stations on Earth.

Discovery opens up new 'dimension' in transmitting information""]";[nan];2019-08-22;Andrew Griffin;Scientists announce major breakthrough in 'quantum teleportation';"Scientists have made a major breakthrough in quantum teleportation, successfully transferring something far more complex than ever before.
Quantum teleportation is a still mysterious phenomena that can see information flung across space.
The effect is not the same as the teleportation often seen in science fiction – where matter is moved through space – but instead is the transfer information about the quantum state of a particle. It could have huge and unimagined effects on the way we organise and transmit information, including the possibility of a vastly more complicated quantum internet.
Until now, scientists have only been able to teleport quantum bits, or qubits. Those are the simplest possible piece of quantum information, where a particle can be in two states at once.
But a qutrit – which scientists have now successfully teleported – adds a whole extra dimension. If a qubit is polarised in two ways at once, a qutrit is polarised in three directions – a vastly more complicated unit, and a far greater challenge for the scientists involved.
It means, in effect, that scientists have more detailed information that can be teleported. A qubit could be 0 or 1; a qutrit can be 0, 1 or 2.
Sending a qutrit rather than a qubit means a vast increase in complexity, because of the nature of the process.
But it also means that the effect could be far more useful. The extra information that can be transferred could power technologies such as a possible quantum internet, allowing for instant and very secure communication.
“The higher the dimensions of your quantum system, the more secure you can ensure your communication is and the more information you can encode,” Ciarán Lee, from University College London, told New Scientist. “But going from a qubit to a qutrit is especially difficult — the tricks you use for qubits have to do with a nice symmetry that qutrits don’t have.”
The researchers report in their new paper, published in Physical Review Letters, that the demonstrations of their technique had a 75 per cent fidelity.

If we can harness it, quantum technology promises fantastic new possibilities. But first, scientists need to coax quantum systems to stay yoked for longer than a few millionths of a second.
A team of scientists at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering announced the discovery of a simple modification that allows quantum systems to stay operational—or ""coherent""—10,000 times longer than before. Though the scientists tested their technique on a particular class of quantum systems called solid-state qubits, they think it should be applicable to many other kinds of quantum systems and could thus revolutionize quantum communication, computing and sensing.
""This breakthrough lays the groundwork for exciting new avenues of research in quantum science,"" said study lead author David Awschalom, the Liew Family Professor in Molecular Engineering, senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory and director of the Chicago Quantum Exchange. ""The broad applicability of this discovery, coupled with a remarkably simple implementation, allows this robust coherence to impact many aspects of quantum engineering. It enables new research opportunities previously thought impractical.""
Down at the level of atoms, the world operates according to the rules of quantum mechanics—very different from what we see around us in our daily lives. These different rules could translate into technology like virtually unhackable networks or extremely powerful computers; the U.S. Department of Energy released a blueprint for the future quantum internet in an event at UChicago on July 23. But fundamental engineering challenges remain: Quantum states need an extremely quiet, stable space to operate, as they are easily disturbed by background noise coming from vibrations, temperature changes or stray electromagnetic fields.
Thus, scientists try to find ways to keep the system coherent as long as possible. One common approach is physically isolating the system from the noisy surroundings, but this can be unwieldy and complex. Another technique involves making all of the materials as pure as possible, which can be costly. The scientists at UChicago took a different tack.
""With this approach, we don't try to eliminate noise in the surroundings; instead, we ""trick"" the system into thinking it doesn't experience the noise,"" said postdoctoral researcher Kevin Miao, the first author of the paper.
In tandem with the usual electromagnetic pulses used to control quantum systems, the team applied an additional continuous alternating magnetic field. By precisely tuning this field, the scientists could rapidly rotate the electron spins and allow the system to ""tune out"" the rest of the noise.
""To get a sense of the principle, it's like sitting on a merry-go-round with people yelling all around you,"" Miao explained. ""When the ride is still, you can hear them perfectly, but if you're rapidly spinning, the noise blurs into a background.""
This small change allowed the system to stay coherent up to 22 milliseconds, four orders of magnitude higher than without the modification—and far longer than any previously reported electron spin system. (For comparison, a blink of an eye takes about 350 milliseconds). The system is able to almost completely tune out some forms of temperature fluctuations, physical vibrations, and electromagnetic noise, all of which usually destroy quantum coherence.
The simple fix could unlock discoveries in virtually every area of quantum technology, the scientists said.
""This approach creates a pathway to scalability,"" said Awschalom. ""It should make storing quantum information in electron spin practical. Extended storage times will enable more complex operations in quantum computers and allow quantum information transmitted from spin-based devices to travel longer distances in networks.""
Though their tests were run in a solid-state quantum system using silicon carbide, the scientists believe the technique should have similar effects in other types of quantum systems, such as superconducting quantum bits and molecular quantum systems. This level of versatility is unusual for such an engineering breakthrough.
""There are a lot of candidates for quantum technology that were pushed aside because they couldn't maintain quantum coherence for long periods of time,"" Miao said. ""Those could be re-evaluated now that we have this way to massively improve coherence.

A new study in Nature says no. A cleverly-designed quantum device developed by Xanadu, a company based in Toronto, Canada, obliterated conventional computers on a benchmark task that would otherwise take over 9,000 years.
For the quantum chip Borealis, answers came within 36 microseconds.
Xanadu’s accomplishment is the latest to demonstrate the power of quantum computing over conventional computers—a seemingly simple idea dubbed quantum advantage.
Theoretically, the concept makes sense. Unlike conventional computers, which calculate in sequence using binary bits—0 or 1—quantum devices tap into the weirdness of the quantum world, where 0 and 1 can both exist at the same time with differing probabilities. The data is processed in qubits, a noncommittal unit that simultaneously performs multiple calculations thanks to its unique physics.
Translation? A quantum computer is like a hyper-efficient multitasker, whereas conventional computers are far more linear. When given the same problem, a quantum computer should be able to trounce any supercomputer in any problem in terms of speed and efficiency. The idea, dubbed “quantum supremacy,” has been the driving force to push for a new generation of computers completely alien to anything previously made.
The problem? Proving quantum supremacy is extremely difficult. As quantum devices increasingly leave the lab to solve more real-world problems, scientists are embracing an intermediate benchmark: quantum advantage, which is the idea that a quantum computer can beat a conventional one at just one task—any task.
Back in 2019, Google broke the internet showcasing the first example of a quantum computer, Sycamore, solving a computational problem in just 200 seconds with 54 qubits—compared to a conventional supercomputer’s estimate of 10,000 years. A Chinese team soon followed with a second fascinating showcase of quantum computational advantage, with the machine spitting out answers that would take a supercomputer over two billion years.
Yet a crucial question remains: are any of these quantum devices even close to being ready for practical use?
A Drastic Redesign
It’s easy to forget that computers rely on physics. Our current system, for example, taps into electrons and cleverly-designed chips to perform their functions. Quantum computers are similar, but they rely on alternative particle physics. Initial generations of quantum machines looked like delicate, shimmering chandeliers. While absolutely gorgeous, compared to a compact smartphone chip, they’re also completely impractical. The hardware often requires tightly-controlled climates—for example, near absolute zero temperature—to reduce interference and boost the computer’s efficacy.
The core concept of quantum computing is the same: qubits processing data in superposition, a quantum physics quirk that allows them to encode 0s, 1s, or both at the same time. The hardware that supports the idea vastly differs.
Google’s Sycamore, for example, uses superconducting metal loops—a setup popular with other tech giants including IBM, which introduced Eagle, a powerful 127-qubit quantum chip in 2021 that’s about the size of a quarter. Other iterations from companies such as Honeywell and IonQ took a different approach, tapping into ions—atoms with one or more electrons removed—as their main source for quantum computing.
Another idea relies on photons, or particles of light. It’s already been proven useful: the Chinese demonstration of quantum advantage, for example, used a photonic device. But the idea’s also been shunned as a mere stepping stone towards quantum computing rather than a practical solution, largely because of difficulties in engineering and setup.
A Photonic Revolution
Xanadu’s team proved naysayers wrong. The new chip, Borealis, is marginally similar to the one in the Chinese study in that it uses photons—rather than superconducting materials or ions—for computation.
But it has a huge advantage: it’s programmable. “Previous experiments typically relied on static networks, in which each component is fixed once fabricated,” explained Dr. Daniel Jost Brod at the Federal Fluminense University at Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, who was not involved in the study. The earlier quantum advantage demonstration in the Chinese study used a static chip. With Borealis, however, the optical elements “can all be readily programmed,” making it less of a single-use device and more of an actual computer potentially capable of solving multiple problems. (The quantum playground is available on the cloud for anyone to experiment and explore once you sign up.)
The chip’s flexibility comes from an ingenious design update, an “innovative scheme [that] offers impressive control and potential for scaling,” said Brod.
The team zeroed in on a problem called Gaussian boson sampling, a benchmark for evaluating quantum computing prowess. The test, while extraordinarily difficult computationally, doesn’t have much impact on real-world problems. However, like chess or Go for measuring AI performance, it acts as an unbiased judge to examine quantum computing performance. It’s a “gold standard” of sorts: “Gaussian boson sampling is a scheme designed to demonstrate the advantages of quantum devices over classical computers,” explained Brod.
The setup is like a carnival funhouse mirror tent in a horror movie. Special states of light (and photons)—amusingly called “squeezed states”—are tunneled onto the chip embedded with a network of beam splitters. Each beam splitter acts like a semi-reflective mirror: depending on how the light hits, it splits into multiple daughters, with some reflecting back and others passing through. At the end of the contraption is an array of photon detectors. The more beam splitters, the more difficult it is to calculate how any individual photon will end up at any given detector.
As another visualization: picture a bean machine, a peg-studded board encased in glass. To play, you drop a puck into the pegs at the top. As the puck falls, it randomly hits different pegs, eventually landing in a numbered slot.
Gaussian boson sampling replaces the pucks with photons, with the goal of detecting which photon lands in which detector slot. Due to quantum properties, the possible resulting distributions grow exponentially, rapidly outpacing any supercomputer powers. It’s an excellent benchmark, explained Brod, largely because we understand the underlying physics, and the setup suggests that even a few hundred photons can challenge supercomputers.
Taking up the challenge, the new study reimagined a photonic quantum device with an admirable 216 qubits. Contradicting classic designs, the device calculated photons in bins of arrival time rather than the previous standard of direction. The trick was to introduce loops of optical fibers to delay photons so they can interfere at specific spots important for quantum computation.
These tweaks led to a vastly slimmed-down device. The usual large network of beam splitters—normally needed for photon communications—can be reduced to just three to accommodate all the necessary delays for photons to interact and compute the task. The loop designs, along with other components, are also “readily programmable” in that a beam splitter can be fine-tuned in real time—like editing computer code, but at the hardware level.
The team also aced a standard sanity check, certifying that the output data was correct.
For now, studies that reliably show quantum supremacy remain rare. Conventional computers have a half century head start. As algorithms keep evolving on conventional computers—especially those that tap into powerful AI-focused chips or neuromorphic computing designs—they may even readily outperform quantum devices, leaving them struggling to catch up.
But that’s the fun of the chase. “Quantum advantage is not a well-defined threshold, based on a single figure of merit. And as experiments develop, so too will techniques to simulate them —we can expect record-setting quantum devices and classical algorithms in the near future to take turns in challenging each other for the top spot,” said Brod.
“It might not be the end of the story,” he continued. But the new study “is a leap forward for quantum physics in this race.”";8308;['ibsl79x', 'ibsnnz7', 'ibsnodk', 'ibsq1pe', 'ibsri8e', 'ibsro6o', 'ibss0lr', 'ibssc83', 'ibssujq', 'ibsu5e3', 'ibsu63q', 'ibsvrza', 'ibswc9m', 'ibt02cd', 'ibtclc0', 'ibtee4g', 'ibtfl00', 'ibtfldv', 'ibtic69', 'ibtjpvf', 'ibtl697', 'ibtrvz9', 'ibtstul', 'ibtu9o7', 'ibtv4rn', 'ibtw57y', 'ibtwtkc', 'ibtycz7', 'ibtz9qw', 'ibu4i7q', 'ibu92pg', 'ibu9git', 'ibua4yh', 'ibuh8y1', 'ibuk86k', 'ibuva05', 'ibux3qw', 'ibv5cyq', 'ibvrxsy', 'ibx6dou'];75;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25];[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.125, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 0.625, 1.0];0.28125;0.496875;0.39205986468905485;0.29379986278928044;11.25;19.875

Together with researchers from Google, the scientists set out to measure the speed of simulation in one of D-Wave's quantum annealing processors, and found that performance increased with both simulation size and problem difficulty, to reach a million-fold speedup over what could be achieved with a classical CPU.
The calculation that D-Wave and Google's teams tackled is a real-world problem; in fact, it has already been resolved by the 2016 winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics, Vadim Berezinskii, J. Michael Kosterlitz and David Thouless, who studied the behavior of so-called ""exotic magnetism"", which occurs in quantum magnetic systems.
The Nobel Prize winners used advanced mathematical methods to describe, in the 1970s, the properties of a two-dimensional quantum magnet, which shed light on the strange – or ""exotic"" – states that matter can take on.
Instead of proving quantum supremacy, which happens when a quantum computer runs a calculation that is impossible to resolve with classical means, D-Wave's latest research demonstrates that the company's quantum annealing processors can lead to a computational performance advantage.
""This work is the clearest evidence yet that quantum effects provide a computational advantage in D-Wave processors,"" said Andrew King, director of performance research at D-Wave.
D-Wave's processors are based on quantum annealing technology, which is a quantum computing technique used to find solutions to optimization problems. While some argue that the scope of the problems that can be resolved by the technology is limited, quantum annealing processors are easier to control and operate than their gate-based equivalents, which is why D-Wave's technology has already reached much higher numbers of qubits than can be found in the devices built by big players like IBM or Google.
To simulate exotic magnetism, King and his team used the D-Wave 2,000-qubit system, which was recently revised to reduce noise, to model a programmable quantum magnetic system, just like Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless did in the 1970s to observe the unusual states of matter. The researchers also programmed a standard classical algorithm for this kind of simulation, called a ""path-integral Monte Carlo"" (PIMC), to compare the quantum results with CPU-run calculations. As the numbers show, the quantum simulation outperformed classical methods by a margin.
""What we see is a huge benefit in absolute terms,"" said King. ""This simulation is a real problem that scientists have already attacked using the algorithms we compared against, marking a significant milestone and an important foundation for future development. This wouldn't have been possible today without D-Wave's lower noise processor.""
Equally as significant as the performance milestone, said D-Wave's team, is the fact that the quantum annealing processors were used to run a practical application, instead of a proof-of-concept or an engineered, synthetic problem with little real-world relevance. Until now, quantum methods have mostly been leveraged to prove that the technology has the potential to solve practical problems, and is yet to make tangible marks in the real world.
In contrast, D-Wave's latest experiment resolved a meaningful problem that scientists are interested in independent of quantum computing. The findings have already attracted the attention of scientists around the world.
""The search for quantum advantage in computations is becoming increasingly lively because there are special problems where genuine progress is being made. These problems may appear somewhat contrived even to physicists,"" said Gabriel Aeppli, professor of physics at ETH Zürich and EPF Lausanne.
""But in this paper from a collaboration between D-Wave Systems, Google, and Simon Fraser University, it appears that there is an advantage for quantum annealing using a special purpose processor over classical simulations for the more 'practical' problem of finding the equilibrium state of a particular quantum magnet.""
D-Wave, however, stayed clear of claiming quantum advantage, which happens when a quantum processor can demonstrate superiority over all possible classical competition; King stressed that it is still possible to design highly specialized algorithms to simulate the model once the properties of the model are already known.
The real significance of the experiment lies in the proof that a computational advantage can already be achieved using existing quantum methods to solve a valuable materials science problem.
""These experiments are an important advance in the field, providing the best look yet at the inner workings of D-Wave computers, and showing a scaling advantage over its chief classical competition,"" said King. ""All quantum computing platforms will have to pass this kind of checkpoint on the way to widespread adoption.""

In particular, in a double-slit experiment, individual particles that are shot through a pair of slits create a pattern as if they each went through both slits simultaneously and interfered with themselves. Researchers have now shown for the first time that antimatter behaves in the same unintuitive way.
Antimatter particles correspond to the regular particles that we are used to, such as protons and electrons, but with the opposite electrical charge and magnetic properties. But when antimatter and matter meet, they both disappear in a flash of energy, which makes antimatter rare and difficult to study.
A new experiment uses positrons — the antimatter counterpart of electrons — to create a situation similar to a traditional double-slit experiment. While scientists have been able to see the quantum interference of electrons for decades, this is the first time they have been able to observe it for antimatter. They present their results in an article published today in the journal Scientific Advances.
The researchers used positrons that were emitted by a radioactive material and then accelerated and formed into a beam. Instead of traveling through just two slits, as in the classic experiment, the beam went through two sequential gratings with different spacing between the slits. This setup helped magnify the effects the researchers needed to measure. The positrons that survived the trip hit a detector, where they formed an interference pattern.
The difference in how many positrons were detected in the high and low points of the pattern depended on the particles’ energy. When the researchers analyzed this dependence, they were able to show that the pattern must have come from the positrons behaving like waves. Since, on average, fewer than one positron should have been travelling through the gratings at any time, the researchers also note that the interference pattern must have come from the individual particles interfering with themselves.
Researchers believe that more experiments like this will open new windows on the behavior of antimatter, including how gravity affects it. While Einstein’s theory of relativity predicts that gravity will affect antimatter in the same way it affects matter, other theories propose differences.";2355;['emvh5xo', 'emvrkxl', 'emvtl69', 'emvuj7e', 'emw223j', 'emw4bj0', 'emw4g1u', 'emw9lt2', 'emwrjux', 'emwt03i', 'emxe2bo', 'emxnl6x', 'emxno77', 'emxrzja', 'emy0lt4', 'emy2w8g', 'emy4nwl', 'emy5swg', 'emyadj0', 'emydcev', 'emyg1od', 'emygb5c', 'emyrnkd', 'emytjnd', 'emyua3e', 'emyvhe4', 'emyxeqm', 'emyzp3e', 'emyzvum', 'emz0jin', 'emz3k1y', 'emz52ic', 'emzciat', 'emzgqrn', 'emzkgs7', 'emzm8ku', 'emzmm49', 'emzo9bx', 'emzu3tu', 'en0ad6n'];70;1;[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0];[1.0, 1.0, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5];0.54375;0.49375;0.4805189252256356;0.19754350786598884;21.75;19.75

A new Department of Energy open-access quantum computing testbed is ready for the public. Scientists from Indiana University recently became the first team to begin using Sandia National Laboratories’ Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed, or QSCOUT.
Quantum computers are poised to become major technological drivers over the coming decades. But to get there, scientists need to experiment with quantum machines that relatively few universities or companies have. Now, scientists can use Sandia’s QSCOUT for research that might not be possible at their home institutions, without the cost or restrictions of using a commercial testbed.
“QSCOUT serves a need in the quantum community by giving users the controls to study the machine itself, which aren’t yet available in commercial quantum computing systems. It also saves theorists and scientists from the trouble of building their own machines. We hope to gain new insights into quantum performance and architecture as well as solve problems that require quantum computation,” said Sandia physicist and QSCOUT lead Susan Clark.
She said the new testbed is a rare machine in three ways: first, as a free, open-access testbed; second, as one made with trapped ion technology; and third, as a platform that gives users an uncommon amount of control over their research.
Last month, Sandia began running the testbed’s first user experiment for scientists from Indiana University. Researchers from IBM, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the University of New Mexico and the University of California, Berkeley, have also been selected to begin experiments soon. Their projects range from testing benchmarking techniques to developing algorithms that could someday solve problems in chemistry too complex for normal computers.
Researchers interested in using the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed are invited to sign up for notifications by emailing [email protected]. Sandia expects to select the next round of projects in the spring, subject to change.
Sandia soliciting proposals
Now, Sandia is getting ready for more research proposals. Anyone can submit a proposal to use QSCOUT, and computing time is free thanks to funding from the DOE Office of Science, Advanced Scientific Computing Research program. The next group of projects is expected to be selected in the spring.
On top of providing an exceptional research opportunity, QSCOUT has a rare design for a testbed. Most commercial testbeds use technology called superconducting circuits. Such machines need to be kept at ultralow temperatures, making them expensive to build and operate. But Sandia’s testbed uses what is called an ion trap instead. This means Sandia’s testbed can run at warmer temperatures. Trapped ions also yield clearer signals than circuits and hold on to information longer, enabling scientists to perform different types of experiments and compare the two platforms.
Trapped ions are held inside QSCOUT in a so-called “trap on a chip,” a flat, bow tie-shaped device, about 2 cm (0.8 inches) long, overlaid on a semiconductor chip.

Indeed, a company called ID Quantique sells an off-the-shelf system that has begun to attract banks and other organisations interested in perfect security.
These systems have an important limitation, however. The current generation of quantum cryptography systems are point-to-point connections over a single length of fibre, So they can send secure messages from A to B but cannot route this information onwards to C, D, E or F. That’s because the act of routing a message means reading the part of it that indicates where it has to be routed. And this inevitably changes it, at least with conventional routers. This makes a quantum internet impossible with today’s technology
Various teams are racing to develop quantum routers that will fix this problem by steering quantum messages without destroying them. We looked at one of the first last year. But the truth is that these devices are still some way from commercial reality.
Today, Richard Hughes and pals at Los Alamos National Labs in New Mexico reveal an alternative quantum internet, which they say they’ve been running for two and half years. Their approach is to create a quantum network based around a hub and spoke-type network. All messages get routed from any point in the network to another via this central hub.
This is not the first time this kind of approach has been tried. The idea is that messages to the hub rely on the usual level of quantum security. However, once at the hub, they are converted to conventional classical bits and then reconverted into quantum bits to be sent on the second leg of their journey.
So as long as the hub is secure, then the network should also be secure.
The problem with this approach is scalability. As the number of links to the hub increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to handle all the possible connections that can be made between one point in the network and another.
Hughes and co say they’ve solved this with their unique approach which equips each node in the network with quantum transmitters–i.e., lasers–but not with photon detectors which are expensive and bulky. Only the hub is capable of receiving a quantum message (although all nodes can send and receiving conventional messages in the normal way).
That may sound limiting but it still allows each node to send a one-time pad to the hub which it then uses to communicate securely over a classical link. The hub can then route this message to another node using another one time pad that it has set up with this second node. So the entire network is secure, provided that the central hub is also secure.
The big advantage of this system is that it makes the technology required at each node extremely simple–essentially little more than a laser. In fact, Los Alamos has already designed and built plug-and-play type modules that are about the size of a box of matches. “Our next-generation [module] will be an order of magnitude smaller in each linear dimension,” they say.
Their ultimate goal is to have one of these modules built in to almost any device connected to a fibre optic network, such as set top TV boxes, home computers and so on, to allow perfectly secure messaging.
Having run this system now for over two years, Los Alamos are now highly confident in its efficacy.
Of course, the network can never be more secure than the hub at the middle of it and this is an important limitation of this approach. By contrast, a pure quantum internet should allow perfectly secure communication from any point in the network to any other.
Another is that this approach will become obsolete as soon as quantum routers become commercially viable. So the question for any investors is whether they can get their money back in the time before then. The odds are that they won’t have to wait long to find out.";3987;['c9tcui7', 'c9te3m8', 'c9te5j8', 'c9tejff', 'c9tep0i', 'c9tet3b', 'c9tety4', 'c9teu33', 'c9tf71e', 'c9tfddq', 'c9tfgf5', 'c9tfhw8', 'c9tfmg4', 'c9tfq4b', 'c9tfymg', 'c9tg2tp', 'c9tg38u', 'c9tg5fd', 'c9tg89a', 'c9tg9bw', 'c9tgagw', 'c9tgf80', 'c9tgqoz', 'c9tgy8h', 'c9th3a6', 'c9th5yw', 'c9th93k', 'c9thaqn', 'c9thbmw', 'c9thcp0', 'c9thklu', 'c9thpmn', 'c9tigli', 'c9tijfm', 'c9tk1fe', 'c9tknrs', 'c9tm74q', 'c9txjup', 'c9u28e5', 'c9wca2r'];67;1;[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 1.0, 0.75];[0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.375, 0.875, 0.0, 0.625, 0.625, 0.625];0.3;0.475;0.4115519408288582;0.2698379143115363;12.0;19.0

According to the theory, gravity is not a fundamental force that ""just is,"" but rather a phenomenon that springs from the entanglement of quantum bodies, similar to the way temperature is derived from the motions of individual particles.']";[nan];2018-05-07;Tyler Krueger;The case against dark matter;"Verlinde believes that this is an indication that he is on to something.
“That fact kind of hints that it has something to do with the Hubble expansion [of the universe], which at present is due to the presence of dark energy,” he says.
The Hubble constant describes the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. This acceleration is unexplained, but has been attributed to “dark energy,” which Verlinde says can be used to explain away the idea of dark matter.
“Dark energy is quite an important part of my theory,” Verlinde says. “I don’t do away with everything that’s called ‘dark,’ I just explain what is what we now call ‘dark matter’ by thinking about what the influence of dark energy would be, and that [dark energy] actually gives the same effect.”
It should be noted that Verlinde is tackling the problem with dark matter from a specific point of view as a string theorist and is working to fit it into that perspective. Mark Van Raamsdonk, a professor of physics at the University of British Columbia, says that this method should be approached with caution.
“This possibility is intriguing, but as far as I'm aware, it's not based on a precise model that is mathematically consistent,” Van Raamsdonk says. “Rather, he's using his intuition to piece together a set of ideas and provide a story for how things might work. He is a very accomplished physicist, so I think his intuition is worth paying attention to.”
Early days
So far, the ideas that Verlinde confidently stand by have proven to be mathematically and observationally valid — at least, as far as galaxy rotation curves go. The real project will be building a theory that describes more than the rotation of galaxies. Sabine Hossenfelder, a research fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, says that a major challenge will be describing the evolution of the early universe.
Currently, theories that incorporate particle dark matter correctly predict the observed temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background. “Unfortunately, Verlinde’s emergent gravity model does not allow the necessary analysis [to prove its validity] — at least not yet,” she wrote in a Forbes
article.
Verlinde is aware of the young theory’s shortcomings, but is confident that he can address them in the future.
“I only focused mostly on trying to explain these rotation curves, but dark matter has been used in many other parts of trying to understand the early universe,” Verlinde says. “I have to develop an explanation of how galaxies form, but also these fluctuations in what we see in the cosmic microwave background. If I want to describe the evolution of the universe, I have to calculate much more what is happening on longer timescales. That is the next step for me.”
Searching for support
Pitching this idea around the world has been quite a task for Verlinde. Given that the idea goes so strongly against popular belief, he has only a handful of allies even amongst his own teammates.
“I have to sell my ideas to various audiences, not just to cosmologists and people that are dealing with dark matter in other ways, but also my string theory colleagues,” he says. “I think people are slowly starting to see the advantages of the logic of my reasoning.”
“There is a lot of work still to be done, but I think this is a better theory than to just assume that there is dark matter. Because if dark matter has so many forms in which people can imagine it’s there, and there are a zoo of those theories and nobody really knows which one it is, maybe all of those are wrong indeed.”
Regardless of how Verlinde’s theory fares overall in the pursuit of understanding, the outcome has some exciting prospects.
“In any case, trying to understand the implications of these new connections between gravity and [quantum] entanglement, is very exciting and many of us are working hard to see where this will lead,” Van Raamsdonk says. “Even if Verlinde's specific explanation for dark matter doesn't turn out to be correct, we are already learning new things about gravity and black holes, and I'm optimistic that we will learn something exciting about cosmology, dark energy, or the Big Bang.”";4174;['dylzmyg', 'dym0lw1', 'dym0xxg', 'dym0ysu', 'dym174f', 'dym7k2x', 'dym7vko', 'dymb7nx', 'dymbh1l', 'dymde20', 'dymmlol', 'dymmodl', 'dymn9c2', 'dymnx3l', 'dymqsq9', 'dymsa1b', 'dymsftw', 'dymshl3', 'dymt8gm', 'dymtasu', 'dymtdiv', 'dymtlkj', 'dymtvsr', 'dymuphn', 'dymwjo6', 'dymyi5j', 'dymyr2i', 'dyn1y14', 'dyn23o6', 'dyn2ql5', 'dyn3cck', 'dyn40bd', 'dyn6aow', 'dyn81oy', 'dyn8m7t', 'dyn9aim', 'dyn9w11', 'dynkrnh', 'dyovvjl', 'e1mx6r4'];66;1;[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0];[1.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.625, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.125, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 1.0, 0.625, 0.0, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0];0.68125;0.56875;0.42200229560986985;0.3061224224064614;27.25;22.75

The acquisition was revealed this week by Richard Murray, the CEO of quantum computing firm Orca. Part of the reason Orca's product caught the MoD's interest, according to Murray, is that some of their devices can fit on a standard computer shelf and work at ambient temperature.
Murray told the outlet, ""It lends itself to all of those sorts of things, plus it's more durable."" ""I mean, maybe a fighter plane one day. I believe we're concentrating on a larger-scale platform that can be deployed on the ground.""
But there's a major issue: it's unclear what these computers are expected to accomplish on board any type of military equipment, especially because experts have yet to demonstrate that the technology has any innovative, real-world uses.
""This equipment we're giving to them surely won't accomplish anything a conventional computer won't,"" Murray told New Scientist. ""I suppose, in that view, it's a research instrument."" ""Right now, a lot of activity is being supported.
That's a little hazy. Quantum computers have already been proven to dramatically accelerate the solution of extremely particular mathematical problems.
Even less obvious is how those talents may be used to assist in a combat situation.
""Through applications such as picture identification and sensor management,"" an Orca representative told New Scientist, ""our hope is that this technology will make communication on the battlefield substantially simpler.""
""This technology will make information processing for command decisions on the battlefield more nimble, while also reducing the hazards of data exchange with an undeployable processor outside the battlefield,"" says the company.
We can't help but think that Orca's agreement with the Ministry of Defense is an issue in search of a solution.
At this moment, it's anyone's guess if quantum computers will allow tanks to become smarter and offer the UK military a large enough advantage on the battlefield.";2102;['icbkcv0', 'icblnce', 'icbmwo7', 'icbncdn', 'icbo6cy', 'icbp6cx', 'icbpj54', 'icbrr68', 'icbt4km', 'icbtik5', 'icbufne', 'icbv5zb', 'icbv67g', 'icbvnlr', 'icbx05u', 'icbx5i8', 'icbxeyu', 'icc0ggm', 'icc2jbk', 'icc2ogl', 'icc3fu4', 'iccdgm1', 'iccgeh3', 'iccnbdy', 'iccykgb', 'icd08yr', 'icd2exw', 'icddb58', 'icddf2p', 'icdi81k', 'icdufvr', 'icenaxp', 'icermb1', 'icf15zh', 'icf9rwu', 'icfc95m', 'icfdr9l', 'icfhgfp', 'icfhp1q', 'icfnwx1'];63;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0];[0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.125, 0.375, 0.0, 0.5, 0.125, 0.375, 0.0, 0.125, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.375, 0.5, 0.125, 0.625, 0.0, 0.625, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0];0.26875;0.26875;0.37661112237957073;0.28027609155973326;10.75;10.75

Experts say technology is getting closer to commercialization
It's not what you'd expect to find on the 29th floor of a Toronto office building. Instead of cubicles, a complex arrangement of lasers, mirrors and optical fibres run from floor to ceiling, making up the quantum computer called Borealis.
And Borealis recently hit a milestone by solving a colossal math problem.
""If we ran [the problem] on the most powerful supercomputer out there, it would take 9,000 years. For Borealis, it takes less than a second, which is quite incredible,"" says Christian Weedbrook, CEO of Xanadu, the company that built Borealis.
Weedbrook said it's just the third time a quantum computer has tackled something out of reach for an ordinary computer, a scenario called quantum advantage. The first time was by Google in 2019, the second by a team of Chinese researchers in 2020. Xanadu's achievement was published earlier this summer in the magazine Nature.
For years, quantum computers have mostly been the focus of academics and government. Now, experts say we could be near a turning point where the technology is closer to commercialization.
""It's a really nice step showing that the technology is mature … and could be a candidate for more wide-scale adoption of quantum computers,"" said Anne Broadbent, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa where she researches quantum computing.
Weedbrook said the potential for quantum computers is almost limitless, opening the door to ""solving important business problems in industries from finance to drug discovery and material design.""
Exponential possibilities
The concepts used in quantum computing may seem mind-bending, and they're very powerful. Ordinary computers encode information using zeros and ones, called binary digits — or bits for short. Using quantum physics, these supercomputers can use zeros, ones, or any value in between, in something known as quantum digits — or qubits. This allows them to perform calculations much faster on problems that are more complex.
But the big difference between the two types of computers is how they actually approach a problem. If a regular computer were to try to get through a maze, it would consider each possible route one at a time. A quantum computer would consider all the routes at once.
""Just adding one [qubit] doubles the computational capacity of your system,"" says Stephanie Simmons, an associate professor of physics at Simon Fraser University and a founder of Vancouver-based quantum startup Photonic. ""It's exponential … so the scale is off the charts and that's the kind of power that we're hoping to leverage.""
In July, Simmons and her team also had an innovation published in Nature: a silicon chip that holds 150,000 qubits. Since silicon is already so widely used in technology, Simmons says it will be easier to produce these beefier chips on a larger scale.
""What we see next is the commercialization of quantum, and so we'll start to see little glimmers and then all of a sudden it's going to change everything we do.""
The race is on to build a universal quantum computer that can solve a wide array of problems. Startups in the sector are booming, with 23 quantum businesses based in Canada, according to McKinsey & Co., a global management consultant. The U.S. is the only country further ahead, sitting at 59 quantum-related startups.
Weedbrook said the growth in this field offers an opportunity to attract scientific talent to the country.
""Xanadu is kind of doing … a brain gain of sorts,"" he said. ""We have over half the people that started it are actually from overseas.""
American corporate heavyweights like IBM, Google and Microsoft are making a big commercial push, as are Amazon and Honeywell. And governments are increasingly making quantum computing a priority. The U.S. just signed the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides about $280 billion US for quantum, computing and artificial intelligence research and development. Meanwhile, China and the EU are also investing heavily in this technology.
""We're looking at a scenario where there's international competition that is very strong,"" said Broadbent, the Ottawa professor. ""Canada has been traditionally ahead in many areas … we want to keep that effort going.""
Canada committed $360 million in the 2021 federal budget towards building a national quantum strategy. Simmons said she hopes that with continued investment ""we could really make a big difference in terms of keeping the jobs here, keeping the talent here and actually benefiting from this economic windfall.""
Getting practical
While quantum computers are still in their nascent stage, experts already point to them as having the potential to solve complex problems like climate change and cybersecurity. The technology is beginning to creep into business plans too, with Goldman Sachs using quantum computers to improve calculations in options financing and Volkswagen looking to use them to optimize its manufacturing.
Prof. Daniel Gottesman, a theoretical computer scientist at the University of Maryland, acknowledges there is still plenty of hype in the industry.
""There's a lot of reason to hope for the future of quantum computing, but there's also uncertainty as well … progress could slow down,"" he said.
Still he predicts quantum computers will live up to expectations; it's just a matter of when. ""It will be some time before we get ones that are big enough to do things that are useful for anything — and even longer before we get ones that are useful for lots of things.""
The technology does face hurdles, including cost and the scale of production, but Simmons expects quantum computing to make a big difference.

The advance marks a long step toward a fully quantum mechanical internet—although such a network is still years away.
The achievement springs not from one particular breakthrough, but from the careful implementation of multiple techniques, says David Awschalom, a physicist at the University of Chicago. ""I'm very impressed that they've integrated these various technologies into a full system,"" he says. ""It's a beautiful piece of work.""
Entanglement links the strange states of tiny quantum mechanical objects. For example, a top can spin either clockwise or counterclockwise, but an atom can spin both ways at once—at least until it is measured and that two-way state collapses one way or the other. Two atoms can be entangled so that each is in an uncertain two-way state, but their spins are definitely correlated, say, in opposite directions. So if physicists measure the first atom and find it spinning clockwise, they know instantly the other one must be spinning counterclockwise, no matter how far away it is.
Entanglement would be key to a fully quantum internet that would let quantum computers of the future communicate with one another and be immune to hacking. If hackers messed with communication, they would spoil the entanglement, revealing their presence. Various companies already sell systems that send messages in quantum states of light that are largely unhackable. But to use such links, the information must still be decoded at each network node, which is potentially vulnerable. In a quantum internet, any node could be entangled with any other, so messages between them couldn't be decoded at intermediate nodes.
But developers must first stretch entanglement over greater distances. Previously, researchers had demonstrated entanglement of two bits of matter over 1.3 kilometers of optical fiber. Now, Xiao-Hui Bao, Jian-Wei Pan, and colleagues at the University of Science and Technology of China, Beijing, have demonstrated entanglement over fiber optic links of up to 50 kilometers, as they report this week in Nature.
The details are dizzying, but the basic idea of the experiment is relatively simple. Researchers start with two identical stations in a single lab, each containing a cloud of rubidium atoms. Prodding each cloud with a laser, they generate a photon whose polarization, which can corkscrew clockwise or counterclockwise, is entangled with the cloud's internal state. They then send the photons down two parallel optical fibers to a third station in another lab 11 kilometers away, where the photons interact in a way that instantly passes the original entanglement connection to the two faraway atom clouds.
To do that, physicists take advantage of the fact that, according to quantum mechanics, a measurement can affect the state of the measured object. At the destination lab, the physicists set up a measurement of the photons' polarizations that, even as it consumes the photons, it also ""projects"" them into a specific entangled state with 25% probability. For those trials, the measurement instantly passes the entanglement back to the atom clouds. The researchers performed a variant of the experiment that extended the link from 22 kilometers to 50 kilometers, albeit with fibers wound on spools.
To make the experiment work, the team had to get several elements just right, Pan says. A major hurdle was avoiding absorption of the photons in the optical fiber. To do that, Pan and colleagues used another laser pulse and a device called a waveguide to stretch the photons' wavelength 60% to the sweet spot for transmission down a standard optical fiber.
At the same, the researchers made life easier for themselves because the atoms clouds were actually less than 1 meter apart and merely connected by a long optical fiber. That closeness made synchronizing the experiment significantly simpler. So, strictly speaking, the record of entangling atomic-scale particles separated by 1.3 kilometers still stands, says, Ronald Hanson, a physicist at Delft University of Technology, who led that earlier effort.
Still, Hanson says, the experiment is significant because, for a network, the setup link is about half of the basic element called a quantum repeater. A repeater would consist of two systems like the one in the experiment placed end to end. Once physicists had entangled the atom clouds at the ends of each system, they could perform additional measurements on clouds in the middle that would swap the entanglement to the clouds on the ends, stretching the entanglement twice as far. ""This experiment is a big step toward a quantum repeater,"" Hanson says.
But several aspects of the work need to be improved before it can be used to make a quantum repeater, Hanson says. In particular, the atom clouds do not yet hold their delicate quantum states long enough to allow the multiple linking needed in a quantum repeater. Pan agrees, but says his group is working on that and urges patience.

That requires multi-million-dollar refrigeration and as soon as you plug them into conventional electronic circuits they’ll instantly overheat.
But now researchers led by Professor Andrew Dzurak at UNSW Sydney have addressed this problem.
“Our new results open a path from experimental devices to affordable quantum computers for real world business and government applications,” says Professor Dzurak.
Getting warmer
The researchers’ proof-of-concept quantum processor unit cell, on a silicon chip, works at 1.5 Kelvin – 15 times warmer than the main competing chip-based technology being developed by Google, IBM, and others, which uses superconducting qubits.
“This is still very cold, but is a temperature that can be achieved using just a few thousand dollars’ worth of refrigeration, rather than the millions of dollars needed to cool chips to 0.1 Kelvin,” explains Dzurak.
“While difficult to appreciate using our everyday concepts of temperature, this increase is extreme in the quantum world.”
Quantum computers are expected to outperform conventional ones for a range of important problems, from precision drug-making to search algorithms. Designing one that can be manufactured and operated in a real-world setting, however, represents a major technical challenge.
The UNSW researchers believe that they have overcome one of the hardest obstacles standing in the way of quantum computers becoming a reality.
In a paper published in the journal Nature today, Dzurak’s team, together with collaborators in Canada, Finland and Japan, report a proof-of-concept quantum processor unit cell that, unlike most designs being explored worldwide, doesn’t need to operate at temperatures below one-tenth of one Kelvin.
Dzurak’s team first announced their experimental results via the academic pre-print archive in February last year. Then, in October 2019, a group in the Netherlands led by a former post-doctoral researcher in Dzurak’s group, Menno Veldhorst, announced a similar result using the same silicon technology developed at UNSW in 2014. The confirmation of this ‘hot qubit’ behaviour by two groups on opposite sides of the world has led to the two papers being published ‘back-to-back’ in the same issue of Nature today.
Qubit pairs are the fundamental units of quantum computing. Like its classical computing analogue – the bit – each qubit characterises two states, a 0 or a 1, to create a binary code. Unlike a bit, however, it can manifest both states simultaneously, in what is known as a “superposition”.
Cheaper and easier to integrate
The unit cell developed by Dzurak’s team comprises two qubits confined in a pair of quantum dots embedded in silicon. The result, scaled up, can be manufactured using existing silicon chip factories, and would operate without the need for multi-million-dollar cooling. It would also be easier to integrate with conventional silicon chips, which will be needed to control the quantum processor.
A quantum computer that is able to perform the complex calculations needed to design new medicines, for example, will require millions of qubit pairs, and is generally accepted to be at least a decade away. This need for millions of qubits presents a big challenge for designers.
“Every qubit pair added to the system increases the total heat generated,” explains Dzurak, “and added heat leads to errors. That’s primarily why current designs need to be kept so close to absolute zero.”
The prospect of maintaining quantum computers with enough qubits to be useful at temperatures much colder than deep space is daunting, expensive and pushes refrigeration technology to the limit.
The UNSW team, however, have created an elegant solution to the problem, by initialising and “reading” the qubit pairs using electrons tunnelling between the two quantum dots.
The proof-of-principle experiments were performed by Dr Henry Yang from the UNSW team, who Dzurak describes as a “brilliant experimentalist”.

Even at absolute zero, when the thermal jiggling of matter is frozen, all things must still buzz to the tune of quantum mechanics. Now this subtle jittering has been detected in a small silicon bar, the first solid object ever to reveal its quantum vibrations.
This phenomenon, called zero-point fluctuation, is a consequence of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, which says that we can never pin down the precise position and motion of any object. So far zero-point energy has only been seen directly in single atoms or small collections of particles.
The new experiment uses a silicon bar about 12 micrometres long and less than a micrometre across. Oskar Painter at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and colleagues cooled the bar to within half a degree of absolute zero and then used a laser to detect its motion.
Some photons from this laser got a shift in energy when they hit the vibrating bar. Ordinary thermal vibrations can either boost or reduce photon energy, but the zero-point quantum vibration is different. Because it is the lowest energy state possible, it can only absorb energy. Painter’s group detected this bias towards lower-energy scattered light, a clear signature of a quantum twang (Physical Review Letters, DOI: 10.1103/physrevlett.108.033602).

In theory and to some extent in practice its tenets demand that a particle can appear to be in two places at once—a paradoxical phenomenon known as superposition—and that two particles can become “entangled,” sharing information across arbitrarily large distances through some still-unknown mechanism.
Perhaps the most famous example of quantum weirdness is Schrödinger’s cat, a thought experiment devised by Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. The Austrian physicist imagined how a cat placed in a box with a potentially lethal radioactive substance could, per the odd laws of quantum mechanics, exist in a superposition of being both dead and alive—at least until the box is opened and its contents observed.
As far-out as that seems, the concept has been experimentally validated countless times on quantum scales. Scaled up to our seemingly simpler and certainly more intuitive macroscopic world, however, things change. No one has ever witnessed a star, a planet or a cat in superposition or a state of quantum entanglement. But ever since quantum theory’s initial formulation in the early 20th century, scientists have wondered where exactly the microscopic and macroscopic worlds cross over. Just how big can the quantum realm be, and could it ever be big enough for its weirdest aspects to intimately, clearly influence living things? Across the past two decades the emergent field of quantum biology has sought answers for such questions, proposing and performing experiments on living organisms that could probe the limits of quantum theory.
Those experiments have already yielded tantalizing but inconclusive results. Earlier this year, for example, researchers showed the process of photosynthesis—whereby organisms make food using light—may involve some quantum effects. How birds navigate or how we smell also suggest quantum effects may take place in unusual ways within living things. But these only dip a toe into the quantum world. So far, no one has ever managed to coax an entire living organism—not even a single-celled bacterium—into displaying quantum effects such as entanglement or superposition.
So a new paper from a group at the University of Oxford is now raising some eyebrows for its claims of the successful entanglement of bacteria with photons—particles of light. Led by the quantum physicist Chiara Marletto and published in October in the Journal of Physics Communications, the study is an analysis of an experiment conducted in 2016 by David Coles from the University of Sheffield and his colleagues. In that experiment Coles and company sequestered several hundred photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria between two mirrors, progressively shrinking the gap between the mirrors down to a few hundred nanometers—less than the width of a human hair. By bouncing white light between the mirrors, the researchers hoped to cause the photosynthetic molecules within the bacteria to couple—or interact—with the cavity, essentially meaning the bacteria would continuously absorb, emit and reabsorb the bouncing photons. The experiment was successful; up to six bacteria did appear to couple in this manner.
Marletto and her colleagues argue the bacteria did more than just couple with the cavity, though. In their analysis they demonstrate the energy signature produced in the experiment could be consistent with the bacteria’s photosynthetic systems becoming entangled with the light inside the cavity. In essence, it appears certain photons were simultaneously hitting and missing photosynthetic molecules within the bacteria—a hallmark of entanglement. “Our models show that this phenomenon being recorded is a signature of entanglement between light and certain degrees of freedom inside the bacteria,” she says.
According to study co-author Tristan Farrow, also of Oxford, this is the first time such an effect has been glimpsed in a living organism. “It certainly is key to demonstrating that we are some way toward the idea of a ‘Schrödinger’s bacterium,’ if you will,” he says. And it hints at another potential instance of naturally emerging quantum biology: Green sulfur bacteria reside in the deep ocean where the scarcity of life-giving light might even spur quantum-mechanical evolutionary adaptations to boost photosynthesis.
There are many caveats to such controversial claims, however. First and foremost, the evidence for entanglement in this experiment is circumstantial, dependent on how one chooses to interpret the light trickling through and out of the cavity-confined bacteria. Marletto and her colleagues acknowledge a classical model free of quantum effects could also account for the experiment’s results. But, of course, photons are not classical at all—they are quantum. And yet a more realistic “semiclassical” model using Newton’s laws for the bacteria and quantum ones for photons fails to reproduce the actual outcome Coles and his colleagues observed in their laboratory. This hints that quantum effects were at play in both the light and the bacteria. “It’s a little bit indirect, but I think it’s because they’re only trying to be so rigorous in ruling out things and claiming anything too much,” says James Wootton, a quantum computing researcher at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory who was not involved in either paper.
The other caveat: the energies of the bacteria and the photon were measured collectively, not independently. This, according to Simon Gröblacher of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands who was not part of this research, is somewhat of a limitation. “There seems to be something quantum going on,” he says. “But…usually if we demonstrate entanglement, you have to measure the two systems independently” to confirm any quantum correlation between them is genuine.
Despite these uncertainties, for many experts, quantum biology’s transition from theoretical dream to tangible reality is a question of when, not if. In isolation and collectively, molecules outside of biological systems have already exhibited quantum effects in decades’ worth of laboratory experiments, so seeking out these effects for similar molecules inside a bacterium or even our own bodies would seem sensible enough. In humans and other large multicellular organisms, however, such molecular quantum effects should be averaged out to insignificance—but their meaningful manifestation within far smaller bacteria would not be too shocking. “I’m a little torn about how surprising [this finding] is,” Gröblacher says. “But it’s obviously exciting if you can show this in a real biological system.”
Several research groups, including those led by Gröblacher and Farrow, are hoping to take these ideas even further. Gröblacher has designed an experiment that could place a tiny aquatic animal called a tardigrade in superposition—a proposition much more difficult than entangling bacteria with light owing to a tardigrade’s hundreds-fold–larger size. Farrow is looking at ways to improve on the bacterial experiment; in 2019 he and his colleagues hope to entangle two bacteria together, rather than independently with light. “The long-term goals are foundational and fundamental,” Farrow says. “This is about understanding the nature of reality, and whether quantum effects have a utility in biological functions. At the root of things, everything is quantum,” he adds, with the big question being whether quantum effects play a role in how living things work.
It might be, for example, that “natural selection has come up with ways for living systems to naturally exploit quantum phenomena,” Marletto notes, such as the aforementioned example of bacteria photosynthesizing in the light-starved deep sea. But getting to the bottom of this requires starting small. The research has steadily been climbing toward macrolevel experiments, with one recent experiment successfully entangling millions of atoms. Proving the molecules that make up living things exhibit meaningful quantum effects—even if for trivial purposes—would be a key next step.

Researchers from University of Copenhagen have developed a new technique that keeps quantum bits of light stable at room temperature instead of only working at -270 degrees. Their discovery saves power and money and is a breakthrough in quantum research.
As almost all our private information is digitalized, it is increasingly important that we find ways to protect our data and ourselves from being hacked. Quantum Cryptography is the researchers’ answer to this problem, and more specifically a certain kind of qubit – consisting of single photons: particles of light.
Single photons or qubits of light, as they are also called, are extremely difficult to hack. However, in order for these qubits of light to be stable and work properly they need to be stored at temperatures close to absolute zero – that is minus 270 C – something that requires huge amounts of power and resources.
Yet in a recently published study, researchers from University of Copenhagen, demonstrate a new way to store these qubits at room temperature for a hundred times longer than ever shown before.
“We have developed a special coating for our memory chips that helps the quantum bits of light to be identical and stable while being in room temperature. In addition, our new method enables us to store the qubits for a much longer time, which is milliseconds instead of microseconds – something that has not been possible before. We are really excited about it,” says Eugene Simon Polzik, professor in quantum optics at the Niels Bohr Institute.
This is why single photons are hard to hack:
- When we write emails or communicate with our bank, each letter is converted into optical codes of photons. A message containing many photons makes it possible for a hacker to tap into your message and steal a part of those photons and information.
- That is why researchers are working on being able to write emails using single photons (qubits of light), which are much harder to steal, because they cannot be divided in smaller parts. Therefore, it is easy to detect if someone is stealing your message.
The special coating of the memory chips makes it much easier to store the qubits of light without big freezers, which are troublesome to operate and require a lot of power. Therefore, the new invention will be cheaper and more compatible with the demands of the industry in the future.
“The advantage of storing these qubits at room temperature is that it does not require liquid helium or complex laser-systems for cooling. Also it is a much more simple technology that can be implemented more easily in a future quantum internet,” says Karsten Dideriksen, a UCPH-PhD on the project.
A special coating keeps the qubits stable
Normally warm temperatures disturb the energy of each quantum bit of light.
“In our memory chips, thousands of atoms are flying around emitting photons also known as qubits of light. When the atoms are exposed to heat, they start moving faster and collide with one another and with the walls of the chip. This leads them to emit photons that are very different from each other. But we need them to be exactly the same in order to use them for safe communication in the future,” explains Eugene Polzik and adds:
“That is why we have developed a method that protects the atomic memory with the special coating for the inside of the memory chips. The coating consists of paraffin that has a wax like structure and it works by softening the collision of the atoms, making the emitted photons or qubits identical and stable. Also we used special filters to make sure that only identical photons were extracted from the memory chips”.
Even though the new discovery is a breakthrough in quantum research, it stills needs more work.
“Right now we produce the qubits of light at a low rate – one photon per second, while cooled systems can produce millions in the same amount of time. But we believe there are important advantages to this new technology and that we can overcome this challenge in time,” Eugene concludes.
Different kinds of quantum bits:
- There are different types of quantum bits that are used for different purposes. Qubits of light consist of photons (particles of light) which are constantly flying around at a high speed. This type of qubit is ideal for quantum communication, because it can travel far without being disturbed.
- In contrast, stationary qubits (they are bound to a specific place) such as superconducting qubits and ionic qubits are well suited for quantum computing.";4568;['h2de6uc', 'h2do81h', 'h2dvwyh', 'h2dzuec', 'h2e314g', 'h2ealkg', 'h2ebpg4', 'h2edrng', 'h2eehu9', 'h2eeptb', 'h2efum8', 'h2ehins', 'h2eia97', 'h2elp87', 'h2ey2rt', 'h2ey6kc', 'h2f0uvv', 'h2f0w61', 'h2f2rzi', 'h2f30w6', 'h2f38e6', 'h2f3u8m', 'h2f47u4', 'h2f6pmy', 'h2fa67t', 'h2fbkee', 'h2fdm6m', 'h2ff94k', 'h2fht84', 'h2fj0uo', 'h2fk8yi', 'h2fnswo', 'h2ftcbj', 'h2ftduo', 'h2fwy2h', 'h2fyyu2', 'h2fzd0a', 'h2g6o7z', 'h2g9264', 'h2gtld4'];62;1;[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25];[1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.875, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.875, 0.875];0.4375;0.55625;0.44633927678392815;0.2957379541080245;17.5;22.25

The research could lay the groundwork for ""a viable quantum internet — a network in which information stored in qubits is shared over long distances through entanglement"" that could ""transform the fields of data storage, precision sensing and computing,"" according to a Fermilab statement.
The team — a collaboration between the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab, the University of Calgary, and other partners —managed to teleport qubits of photons over 44 kilometers of fiber.
The process doesn't actually involve teleportation in the traditional sense. Quantum teleportation is the transfer of quantum states from one location to another. Through quantum entanglement, two particles in separate locations are connected by an invisible force, famously referred to as ""spooky action at a distance"" by Albert Einstein.
Regardless of the distance, the encoded information shared by the ""entangled"" pair of particles can be passed between them.
By sharing these quantum qubits, the basic units of quantum computing, researchers are hoping to create networks of quantum computers that can share information at blazing-fast speeds.
""This is an advancement towards a more readily available scaling up of such systems in different locations, to build a bigger system,"" Christoph Simon, professor of physics at the University of Calgary and co-author of the accompanying study published in the Physical Review journal earlier this month, said in the university's statement about the research.
But keeping this information flow stable over long distances has proven extremely difficult. The previous world record was held by researchers at the University of Calgary, covering a distance of just six kilometers, as VICE reports.
Researchers are now hoping to scale up such a system, using both entanglement to send information and quantum memory to store it as well.

No word on pricing just yet, but I wouldn't expect much change from $15 million—the cost of a non-universal D-Wave quantum computer.
In other news, IBM has also opened up an API (sample code available on Github) that gives developers easier access to the five-qubit quantum computer currently connected to the IBM cloud. Later in the year IBM will release a full SDK, further simplifying the process of building quantum software.
You can't actually do much useful computation with five qubits, mind you, but fortunately IBM also has news there: the company's quantum simulator can now simulate up to 20 qubits. The idea is that developers should start thinking about potential 20-qubit quantum scenarios now, so they're ready to be deployed when IBM builds the actual hardware.
Speaking of hardware, it seems IBM has accelerated its universal quantum computing roadmap somewhat. In May last year IBM said it would like to build a 50-qubit computer ""in the next decade."" Now we're down to ""the next few years.""
IBM has also fleshed out its quantum computing roadmap a little, providing some guidance on how it will actually build a universal 50-qubit computer:
IBM’s roadmap to scale to practical quantum computers is based on a holistic approach to advancing all parts of the system. IBM will leverage its deep expertise in superconducting qubits, complex high performance system integration, and scalable nanofabrication processes from the semiconductor industry to help advance the quantum mechanical capabilities.
Despite the aggressive roadmap, however, there is no evidence that any scaling has, in fact, occurred. Recal the original publication, which involved nine computational qubits, and a total of 1000 qubits. Now IBM wants their quantum computer to be fully interconnected, so 50 computational qubits requires 1,225 connections. Each link seems to require 48 qubits for control, so 58,800 qubits. This is quite a jump for 1000 qubits on a board.
Comparing to D-Wave, which also produces boards with around 1000 qubits, they always end up with one or two non-functional qubits. In this case, it is most likely that a non-functional qubit will be in the connection between two computational qubits, rendering not one, but two nodes useless.
We'll be a lot more confident in IBM's scaling when we see actual papers with increasing numbers of computational qubits.
Other than D-Wave, IBM doesn't have much competition in the quantum computing space—and as we've explained in the past, both companies appear to be approaching quantum computing quite differently. IBM has set its sights on building a true universal quantum computer, which can be used to solve any quantum algorithm under the sun. D-Wave seems more focused on scaling up the number of qubits and ensuring its system can integrate easily with classical computers, but not ensuring its qubits are actually qubits.
While exact pricing, availability, and specs are still a long way off, it's fairly safe to assume that IBM's quantum computers will be about the same price as a D-Wave (~$15 million) or perhaps a little dearer. Both systems are fundamentally the same thing: a fancy chip inside a box that contains a multi-stage dilution refrigerator from a company like BlueFors.
Dilution refrigerators take about 24 hours to cool down, but they can then keep the chip at close-to-absolute-zero (~5mK, -273.145°C)—a prerequisite for current quantum computing chips—almost indefinitely.
And finally, a random factoid: the photo on the right shows me standing on a ladder next to one of IBM's dilution refrigerators at IBM Research headquarters in upstate New York back in 2013.";3758;['deko5rh', 'dekoptn', 'dekoqy3', 'dekp9c4', 'dekpb25', 'dekpsjx', 'dekqlgo', 'dekr4u7', 'dekr6ky', 'dekrnuh', 'deks447', 'deksd7m', 'dekt6sa', 'dekv3db', 'dekx05j', 'dekxfqm', 'dekxwn4', 'dekzie8', 'del1n9l', 'del20mq', 'del3v63', 'del5acx', 'del6vws', 'del8pyy', 'del8vrr', 'delc0ph', 'delcx33', 'deldwni', 'delepld', 'delkxp3', 'dellpdf', 'delpe71', 'delsowj', 'delvx6f', 'dely4hp', 'delynw8', 'delz99u', 'dem1mix', 'dem4bxq', 'dem5wep'];61;1;[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.75, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0];0.375;0.4625;0.4743416490252569;0.2579970930068787;15.0;18.5

Post-Quantum Cryptography (opens in new tab) is an emerging field of research, with researchers devising mechanisms to shore up current encryption algorithms against the seemingly unlimited computing performance promised by quantum computers.
The NSA however has expressed its reservations about the potential of quantum computing in a FAQ titled Quantum Computing and Post-Quantum Cryptography. 
“NSA does not know when or even if a quantum computer of sufficient size and power to exploit public key cryptography (a CRQC) will exist,” said the security agency in response to whether it is worried about the potential of adversarial use of quantum computing.
Public-key encryption drives most of the standards and protocols on the internet and the cloud, which help ensure the integrity of the data even when it’s been hijacked by snoopers.
In the FAQ, the NSA describes a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) as a quantum computer that’s capable of actually attacking real world cryptographic systems, something that’s currently infeasible.
While it agrees that such a computer would be “devastating” to the digital security infrastructure, it seems to suggest that it doesn’t believe such a CRQC would ever materialize.
However, the growing research in quantum computing has moved the agency to also support the development of post-quantum cryptographic standards, along with plans for eventual transition to such standards.
However, speaking to industry experts, The Register concludes that research on cryptography standards aren’t much of a concern to cybersecurity (opens in new tab) specialists.
“In a world where users will divulge their passwords (opens in new tab) in return for chocolate or in response to an enticing phishing email (opens in new tab), the risk of quantum computers might not be our biggest threat,” Martin Lee, a technical lead at Cisco's Talos security division told The Register.

Applying a quantum theory of gravity to black holes eliminates the baffling singularity at their core, leaving behind what looks like an entry point to another universe'];[nan];2013-05-29;Katia Moskvitch;Quantum gravity takes singularity out of black holes;"Falling into a black hole may not be as final as it seems. Apply a quantum theory of gravity to these bizarre objects and the all-crushing singularity at their core disappears.
In its place is something that looks a lot like an entry point to another universe. Most immediately, that could help resolve the nagging information loss paradox that dogs black holes.
Though no human is likely to fall into a black hole anytime soon, imagining what would happen if they did is a great way to probe some of the biggest mysteries in the universe. Most recently this has led to something known as the black hole firewall paradox – but black holes have long been a source of cosmic puzzles.
According to Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, if a black hole swallows you, your chances of survival are nil. You’ll first be torn apart by the black hole’s tidal forces, a process whimsically named spaghettification.
Eventually, you’ll reach the singularity, where the gravitational field is infinitely strong. At that point, you’ll be crushed to an infinite density. Unfortunately, general relativity provides no basis for working out what happens next. “When you reach the singularity in general relativity, physics just stops, the equations break down,” says Abhay Ashtekar of Pennsylvania State University.
The same problem crops up when trying to explain the big bang, which is thought to have started with a singularity. So in 2006, Ashtekar and colleagues applied loop quantum gravity to the birth of the universe. LQG combines general relativity with quantum mechanics and defines space-time as a web of indivisible chunks of about 10-35 metres in size. The team found that as they rewound time in an LQG universe, they reached the big bang, but no singularity – instead they crossed a “quantum bridge” into another older universe. This is the basis for the “big bounce” theory of our universe’s origins.
Information paradox
Now Jorge Pullin at Louisiana State University and Rodolfo Gambini at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay, have applied LQG on a much smaller scale – to an individual black hole – in the hope of removing that singularity too. To simplify things, the pair applied the equations of LQG to a model of a spherically symmetrical, non-rotating “Schwarzschild” black hole.
In this new model, the gravitational field still increases as you near the black hole’s core. But unlike previous models, this doesn’t end in a singularity. Instead gravity eventually reduces, as if you’ve come out the other end of the black hole and landed either in another region of our universe, or another universe altogether. Despite only holding for a simple model of a black hole, the researchers – and Ashtekar – believe the theory may banish singularities from real black holes too.
That would mean that black holes can serve as portals to other universes. While other theories, not to mention some works of science fiction, have suggested this, the trouble was that nothing could pass through the portal because of the singularity. The removal of the singularity is unlikely to be of immediate practical use, but it could help with at least one of the paradoxes surrounding black holes, the information loss problem.
A black hole soaks up information along with the matter it swallows, but black holes are also supposed to evaporate over time. That would cause the information to disappear forever, defying quantum theory. But if a black hole has no singularity, then the information needn’t be lost – it may just tunnel its way through to another universe. “Information doesn’t disappear, it leaks out,” says Pullin.";3643;['ca82dlf', 'ca8az1n', 'ca8btrd', 'ca8c4l4', 'ca8c7y6', 'ca8efbr', 'ca8eg6q', 'ca8ev7q', 'ca8fqb8', 'ca8g22j', 'ca8gedg', 'ca8ghbp', 'ca8glfn', 'ca8gtd8', 'ca8h6ti', 'ca8h7id', 'ca8h8pi', 'ca8hbir', 'ca8hllr', 'ca8hnk5', 'ca8hop5', 'ca8hr73', 'ca8hsu9', 'ca8i1d3', 'ca8i8ej', 'ca8icj2', 'ca8j1lq', 'ca8jen0', 'ca8jwb3', 'ca8l8si', 'ca8lrlz', 'ca8ocqw', 'ca8p6os', 'ca8pis8', 'ca8pkb4', 'ca8t4lh', 'ca8w624', 'ca90dhx', 'ca93fcn', 'ca9ah20'];60;1;[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0];[0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.125, 0.125, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.0, 0.25];0.53125;0.54375;0.49430348724240253;0.2925507434617113;21.25;21.75

The technology would allow information to be “transported” in an instant. It would help bring about a promised quantum computing revolution as well as bringing radical change in how networks function.
But, to get there, scientists must first figure out the basic technology so that it can be used in more complex networks.
Now scientists say they have done some of that fundamental work, in a new study that reports a success in teleporting quantum information between two nodes of a network that are not connected to each other.
In the study, scientists created a three-node quantum network, giving each of those nodes a name: Alice, Bob and Charlie. In the network, Alice was connected to Bob, and Bob was connected to Charlie – but Charlie was not connected to Bob.
Scientists say they have successfully shared information between Alice and Bob, despite the fact they are not connected.
So far, researchers have only been able to demonstrate connections between neighbouring nodes, and the new study represents the first success of this kind.
Now scientists hope it represents a first step towards building a larger quantum network built on the sharing of quantum information.
That future is still “some way off”, researchers away from the new study say. But the paper offers a “potential path forward” to building real world applications of the technology.
“This achievement is not only a win for fundamental science, but also represents an advance in the real-world problem solving required to move this fascinating quantum application to the next step,” write Oliver Slattery and Yong-Su Kim in an accompanying article.
Actually building such systems will require more robust systems, as well as new interfaces that should improve the efficiency of the system.
That will be crucial to bring the breakthroughs in the work to more complex quantum systems, the authors say.

One of the cornerstones of quantum theory is the principle that you cannot measure any property of an object without affecting the object itself. Indeed, detecting the very existence of a photon until now has usually meant destroying it. Physicists, however, have now devised a way to detect single photons of visible light without bringing about their demise. Others had done the same with microwave photons, but this is the first time that it has been done in the part of the spectrum that could matter for a future 'quantum Internet'.
The conventional way to detect a single particle of light is to catch it with a sensor, absorbing its energy but destroying the particle in the process.
In recent years, physicists have developed methods to extract part of the information from a particle’s quantum state — for example showing that it is more likely to be in one place than in another — in a set of methods known as weak measurement. But in doing so, they reduce the amount of information carried by the quantum state itself.
The new technique instead definitively detects whether the photon is there at all, while potentially leaving further quantum information intact, says Stephan Ritter, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching, Germany, and a co-author of the study. The researchers observe a trace of the photon — the 'envelope' containing the information — and pass it on without reading what is inside, he explains.
This could be useful in applications such as quantum networks, which promise to transport data with unbreakable encryption, but require delicate quantum states to be transmitted without any disturbance. Quantum networks encode information in quantum bits, or qubits, which can occupy multiple states simultaneously as if they were living separate histories in parallel universes at the same time. Thus, unlike the information-carrying bits in conventional computers, qubits can be in a superposition of both '0' and '1' at the same time. But any disturbance will force the qubit to pick one of the two states, destroying the richer information.
Optical trickery
In their experiments, described today in Science1, Ritter and his colleagues set up an optical cavity consisting of two mirrors facing each other just half a millimetre apart, which can confine between them photons of specific 'resonant' energies. Inside, the team trapped a single atom in a superposition of two states, one of which was resonant with the cavity. An atom in this resonant state prevents photons of the same energy from entering the cavity.
When the team fired a photon at the cavity, the atom’s dual personality caused two things to happen at once. In one of the 'parallel universes' of its superposition, the one in which the atom was resonant with the cavity, the photon did not enter: it just bounced back from the outside of one of the mirrors. In the other parallel universe, the photon entered the cavity, bounced between the two mirrors, and then exited again the same way it came in. The overall quantum state of the photon was not affected, but the state of the atom was: The phase between the coupled and the uncoupled state was shifted by 180 degrees. By reading this shift, the researchers could detect the passage of the photon, explains Ritter.
Serge Haroche, a physicist at the Collège de France in Paris, pioneered a similar technique2 in the 1990s as part of research for which he went on to win a Nobel prize in 2012. However, he and his collaborators were able to achieve the feat only with photons in the microwave range, which are not suitable for quantum communications.
Philippe Grangier, a physicist at the Institute of Optics in Palaiseau, France, says that Ritter's technique might form part of a toolbox needed to create a quantum repeater, a key component of a future quantum Internet.
However, Gilles Nogues, a physicist at the Néel Institute in Grenoble, France, who worked with Haroche on the microwave-photon experiments, says that this stage is some way off. For any quantum applications to work, the device needs to operate with photons in superpositions of states, something that Ritter's team has yet to demonstrate. ""Non-destructive measurements are boring as long as you just measure 0 or 1. But they become fascinating as soon as you use them on a quantum superposition of those two values,"" he says.";4434;['cdevwss', 'cdexu6z', 'cdey13h', 'cdey1d1', 'cdey3kt', 'cdey728', 'cdeybft', 'cdeziof', 'cdezywk', 'cdf0g8b', 'cdf0njg', 'cdf0siy', 'cdf0wym', 'cdf17i2', 'cdf20qj', 'cdf2733', 'cdf28k0', 'cdf2cbm', 'cdf2mfq', 'cdf2ow1', 'cdf2p3v', 'cdf2yli', 'cdf33ny', 'cdf349i', 'cdf3j6y', 'cdf3mt6', 'cdf50yj', 'cdf54st', 'cdf5hvv', 'cdf6o3q', 'cdf7te3', 'cdf7xbm', 'cdf81mu', 'cdf8zex', 'cdfgmw3', 'cdfhlwj', 'cdfi537', 'cdfjnyj', 'cdfm1mu', 'cdgn8fe'];59;1;[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.375, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.375, 1.0, 1.0, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0];0.53125;0.4125;0.48472769417478095;0.28939592256975566;21.25;16.5

Quantum entanglement is a state where electrons are spatially separated, but able to affect one another. It's been proposed that birds' eyes contain entanglement-based compasses.
Conclusive proof doesn't yet exist, but multiple lines of evidence suggest it. Findings like this one underscore just how sophisticated those compasses may be.
""How can a living system have evolved to protect a quantum state as well -- no, better -- than we can do in the lab with these exotic molecules?"" asked quantum physicist Simon Benjamin of Oxford University and the National University of Singapore, a co-author of the new study. ""That really is an amazing thing.""
Many animals -- including not only birds, but some mammals, fish, reptiles, even crustaceans and insects -- navigate by sensing the direction of Earth's magnetic field. Physicist Klaus Schulten of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign proposed in the late 1970s that bird navigation relied on some geomagnetically sensitive, as-yet-unknown biochemical reaction taking place in their eyes.
Research since then has revealed the existence of special optical cells containing a protein called cryptochrome. When a photon enters the eye, it hits cryptochrome, giving a boost of energy to electrons that exist in a state of quantum entanglement.
One of the electrons migrates a few nanometers away, where it feels a slightly different magnetic field than its partner. Depending on how the magnetic field alters the electron's spin, different chemical reactions are produced. In theory, the products of many such reactions across a bird's eye could create a picture of Earth's magnetic field as a varying pattern of light and dark.
>'N@C60 is quite a sexy, interesting, promising molecule.'
However, these quantum states are notoriously fragile. Even in laboratory systems, atoms are cooled to near–absolute-zero temperatures to maintain entanglement for more than a few thousandths of a second. Biological systems would seem too warm and too wet to hold quantum states for long, yet that's exactly what they appear to do.
Researchers led by University of California, Irvine physicist Thorsten Ritz (.pdf) showed in 2004 that, although robins had no trouble pointing their beaks toward Africa under the influence of Earth's magnetic field alone, adding a second, shifting field destroyed their inner compasses. That second field was so weak -- less than one-third of 1 percent of Earth's field -- that it could only have influenced a quantum-sensitive system.
""It shouldn’t be the case that the birds would even know that this had happened,"" Benjamin said. ""If someone changed the brightness of the scene that you’re seeing by a-third of 1 percent, you would struggle to know that it even happened. It certainly wouldn’t muck up your vision.
In a new paper in Physical Review Letters, Benjamin and colleagues built a mathematical model of Ritz's experiment, including the Earth's magnetic field, the slight secondary field, and the quantum systems that might make up the birds' magnetic sense.";3271;['c1egwpd', 'c1eh028', 'c1eh442', 'c1eh4p3', 'c1eh6up', 'c1eh8d0', 'c1ehe0n', 'c1ehelc', 'c1ehh3t', 'c1ehhib', 'c1ehi0j', 'c1ehle2', 'c1ehm7k', 'c1ehmi8', 'c1ehqor', 'c1ei7gy', 'c1ei7sj', 'c1ei9h9', 'c1ei9ja', 'c1eiczz', 'c1eiesi', 'c1eiggi', 'c1einq3', 'c1eipbi', 'c1eis17', 'c1eise9', 'c1eitmb', 'c1ej07a', 'c1ej3x1', 'c1ej42d', 'c1ej55h', 'c1ej966', 'c1ejen3', 'c1ejeqd', 'c1ejfgd', 'c1ejrma', 'c1ejycv', 'c1ejzjc', 'c1ek9nr', 'c1ekiqp'];58;1;[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75];[1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.875, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0];0.425;0.496875;0.4847679857416329;0.3301130251519924;17.0;19.875

Particles of light, or photons, could be transmitted over vast, interstellar distances without losing their quantum nature, researchers report June 28 in Physical Review D. That means scientists searching for extraterrestrial signals could also look for quantum messages (SN: 1/28/19).
Scientists are currently developing Earth-based quantum communication, a technology that uses quantum particles to send information and has the potential to be more secure than standard, or classical, communication (SN: 6/15/17). Intelligent extraterrestrials, if they’re out there, may have also adopted quantum communication, says theoretical physicist Arjun Berera.
A major obstacle to quantum communication is decoherence, in which a quantum particle loses its quantumness as it interacts with its surroundings. “Quantum states you generally think of as very delicate, and if there’s any kind of external interaction, you kind of destroy that state,” Berera says.
Since the average density of matter in space is much less than on Earth, particles could be expected to travel farther before succumbing to decoherence. So Berera and theoretical physicist Jaime Calderón Figueroa, both of the University of Edinburgh, calculated how far light — in particular, X-rays — could travel unscathed through interstellar space.
X-ray photons could more than traverse the Milky Way, potentially traveling hundreds of thousands of light-years or even more, the researchers found.
Based on the findings, Berera and Calderón Figueroa considered strategies to search for E.T.’s quantum dispatches. One potential type of communication to search for is quantum teleportation, in which the properties of a distant particle can be transferred to another (SN: 7/7/17). Since the technology requires both quantum and classical signals, scientists could look for such simultaneous signals to identify any alien quantum missives.";1967;['if2kpqk', 'if2mihr', 'if2rorz', 'if2t1n3', 'if2wqrr', 'if33sdl', 'if35ykf', 'if3azag', 'if3h3or', 'if3i3e3', 'if3ij2n', 'if3mj7e', 'if3sbop', 'if3v1b3', 'if3vuuf', 'if401te', 'if41fty', 'if45kbs', 'if4a6nv', 'if4alty', 'if4eaai', 'if4s62w', 'if4v6e3', 'if50h74', 'if52dgs', 'if52v6l', 'if55z1o', 'if5gkuc', 'if5las7', 'if5ukpq', 'if5v6gr', 'if60r7y', 'if65ibv', 'if67tqk', 'if6c6ma', 'if6l0nk', 'if6lrjm', 'if6o2wb', 'if6skel', 'if6utz4'];55;1;[1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.25];[0.5, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.125, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.0];0.38125;0.421875;0.43656149337750805;0.27054271266289914;15.25;16.875

Yale University scientists have found a way to observe quantum information while preserving its integrity, an achievement that offers researchers greater control in the volatile realm of quantum mechanics and greatly improves the prospects of quantum computing.
Quantum computers would be exponentially faster than the most powerful computers of today.
""Our experiment is a dress rehearsal for a type of process essential for quantum computing,"" said Michel Devoret, the Frederick William Beinecke Professor of Applied Physics & Physics at Yale and principal investigator of research published Jan. 11 in the journal Science. ""What this experiment really allows is an active understanding of quantum mechanics. It's one thing to stare at a theoretical formula and it's another thing to be able to control a real quantum object.""
In quantum systems, microscopic units called qubits represent information. Qubits can assume either of two states—""0"" or ""1""—or both simultaneously. Correctly recognizing, interpreting, and tracking their state is necessary for quantum computing. However, the act of monitoring them usually damages their information content.
The Yale physicists successfully devised a new, non-destructive measurement system for observing, tracking and documenting all changes in a qubit's state, thus preserving the qubit's informational value. In principle, the scientists said, this should allow them to monitor the qubit's state in order to correct for random errors.
""As long as you know what error process has occurred, you can correct,"" Devoret said. ""And then everything's fine. You can basically undo the errors.""
""That's the key,"" said Michael Hatridge, a postdoctoral associate in physics at Yale and lead author of the Science paper, ""the ability to talk to the qubit and hear what it's telling you.""
He continued: ""A major problem with quantum computing is the finite lifetime of information stored in the qubits, which steadily decays and which must be corrected. We now know that it is possible to do this correction by feedback involving a continuous measurement.

Amazon is also in the mix. The company the AWS Center for Quantum Computing last year and has via Amazon Web Services since 2019. It's expanding that work to what it says is an essential aspect of helping quantum tech reach its full potential: quantum networking. As such, the company has the AWS Center for Quantum Networking (CQN).
As with quantum computing, it's early days for quantum networking. It will likely before researchers start getting the most out of quantum tech. However, Amazon has more resources than most to invest in the field.
Amazon notes that quantum networks will be able to connect quantum devices using single photons rather than laser beams (which are utilized in modern optical communications). However, along with enabling certain capabilities of quantum networks, there are some hurdles to overcome when it comes to using a single photon. Quantum mechanics limits the amplification of a single photon, which restricts the range of a network. ""Also, the weakness of single photons complicates interfacing them with today’s quantum computing devices,"" CQN research scientists Denis Sukachev and Mihir Bhaskar wrote in a blog post.
Researchers at the center will work on new technologies, such as quantum repeaters and transducers, to allow for the creation of global quantum networks. They'll develop hardware, software and apps for quantum networks.
Among the potential applications of quantum networking is ""enabling global communications protected by quantum key distribution with privacy and security levels not achievable using conventional encryption techniques,"" Sukachev and Bhaskar wrote.

In a new paper in the journal Science Advances, an international team of quantum physicists argue that thanks to the unusual rules of quantum mechanics, facts themselves could depend on who's looking at them. In other words, reality could be twisted by observation.
On a quantum level, it's long been understood that particles can be in several states at once. That changes once those particles are observed, breaking the so-called ""superposition"" — a mind-bending principle most famously described by the ""Schrödinger's cat"" thought experiment.
Say you tossed a coin in a closed room and your friend is outside that room trying to figure out the outcome of your coin toss. Once you've tossed the coin, you know for a fact what the result is. Your friend, however, cannot tell the outcome from the outside: to them, the two states, ""heads"" or ""tails,"" are ""superimposed.""
Quantum physicists describe this difference in established facts as a contradiction — your friend observes a superimposed state, while you observe a definite answer.
In an experimental test at the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, the researchers built a small-scale quantum computer. Their aim was to scientifically prove that measurements in quantum mechanics are actually subjective to a particular observer.
They measured the polarization of three pairs of photons. One pair acted as two coins, meaning each one can be either heads or tails depending on its polarization. Then they used the two remaining pairs to measure the first pair's polarization in each of the two boxes — acting, essentially, as ""observers."" Two separate photons outside of each box act as a control.
After weeks of calculations, the researchers found something strange: the polarization states didn't match up. The inside and outside photon observers couldn't agree on the outcome or polarization state of each photon inside the box.
""Eventually, we succeeded in showing that quantum mechanics might indeed be incompatible with the assumption of objective facts — we violated the inequality!"" lead researchers Alessandro Fedrizzi and Massimiliano Proietti, quantum physicists at Heriot-Watt University, wrote in a recent piece for The Conversation.
""The insight we gained is that quantum observers may indeed be entitled to their own facts,"" wrote Fedrizzi in a September statement. That brings up the question: do the rules of quantum mechanics apply to much larger objects? Or are the rules different for single atoms or photons?
It's a fascinating experiment that seemingly brings up more questions than it's able to answer.
""Clearly these are all deeply philosophical questions about the fundamental nature of reality,"" wrote Fedrizzi and Proietti in The Conversation.

A happy accident in the laboratory has led to a breakthrough discovery that not only solved a problem that stood for more than half a century, but has major implications for the development of quantum computers and sensors.In a study published today in Nature, a team of engineers at UNSW Sydney has done what a celebrated scientist first suggested in 1961 was possible, but has eluded everyone since: controlling the nucleus of a single atom using only electric fields.
""This discovery means that we now have a pathway to build quantum computers using single-atom spins without the need for any oscillating magnetic field for their operation,"" says UNSW's Scientia Professor of Quantum Engineering Andrea Morello. ""Moreover, we can use these nuclei as exquisitely precise sensors of electric and magnetic fields, or to answer fundamental questions in quantum science.""
That a nuclear spin can be controlled with electric, instead of magnetic fields, has far-reaching consequences. Generating magnetic fields requires large coils and high currents, while the laws of physics dictate that it is difficult to confine magnetic fields to very small spaces—they tend to have a wide area of influence. Electric fields, on the other hand, can be produced at the tip of a tiny electrode, and they fall off very sharply away from the tip. This will make control of individual atoms placed in nanoelectronic devices much easier.
A new paradigm
Prof Morello says the discovery shakes up the paradigm of nuclear magnetic resonance, a widely used technique in fields as disparate as medicine, chemistry, or mining. ""Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is one of the most widespread techniques in modern physics, chemistry, and even medicine or mining,"" he says. ""Doctors use it to see inside a patient's body in great detail while mining companies use it to analyse rock samples. This all works extremely well, but for certain applications, the need to use magnetic fields to control and detect the nuclei can be a disadvantage.""
Prof Morello uses the analogy of a billiard table to explain the difference between controlling nuclear spins with magnetic and electric fields.
""Performing magnetic resonance is like trying to move a particular ball on a billiard table by lifting and shaking the whole table,"" he says. ""We'll move the intended ball, but we'll also move all the others.""
""The breakthrough of electric resonance is like being handed an actual billiards stick to hit the ball exactly where you want it.""
Amazingly, Prof Morello was completely unaware that his team had cracked a longstanding problem in finding a way to control nuclear spins with electric fields, first suggested in 1961 by a pioneer of magnetic resonance and Nobel Laureate, Nicolaas Bloembergen.
""I have worked on spin resonance for 20 years of my life, but honestly, I had never heard of this idea of nuclear electric resonance,"" Prof Morello says. ""We 'rediscovered' this effect by complete accident—it would never have occurred to me to look for it. The whole field of nuclear electric resonance has been almost dormant for more than half a century, after the first attempts to demonstrate it proved too challenging.""
Out of curiosity
The researchers had originally set out to perform nuclear magnetic resonance on a single atom of antimony—an element that possesses a large nuclear spin. One of the lead authors of the work, Dr. Serwan Asaad, explains: ""Our original goal was to explore the boundary between the quantum world and the classical world, set by the chaotic behaviour of the nuclear spin. This was purely a curiosity-driven project, with no application in mind.""
""However, once we started the experiment, we realised that something was wrong. The nucleus behaved very strangely, refusing to respond at certain frequencies, but showing a strong response at others,"" recalls Dr. Vincent Mourik, also a lead author on the paper.
""This puzzled us for a while, until we had a 'eureka moment' and realised that we were doing electric resonance instead of magnetic resonance.""
Dr. Asaad continued: ""What happened is that we fabricated a device containing an antimony atom and a special antenna, optimized to create a high-frequency magnetic field to control the nucleus of the atom. Our experiment demands this magnetic field to be quite strong, so we applied a lot of power to the antenna, and we blew it up!""
Game on
""Normally, with smaller nuclei like phosphorus, when you blow up the antenna it's 'game over' and you have to throw away the device,"" says Dr. Mourik.""But with the antimony nucleus, the experiment continued to work. It turns out that after the damage, the antenna was creating a strong electric field instead of a magnetic field. So we 'rediscovered' nuclear electric resonance.""
After demonstrating the ability to control the nucleus with electric fields, the researchers used sophisticated computer modelling to understand how exactly the electric field influences the spin of the nucleus. This effort highlighted that nuclear electric resonance is a truly local, microscopic phenomenon: the electric field distorts the atomic bonds around the nucleus, causing it to reorient itself.
""This landmark result will open up a treasure trove of discoveries and applications,"" says Prof Morello. ""The system we created has enough complexity to study how the classical world we experience every day emerges from the quantum realm. Moreover, we can use its quantum complexity to build sensors of electromagnetic fields with vastly improved sensitivity. And all this, in a simple electronic device made in silicon, controlled with small voltages applied to a metal electrode!""";5721;['fme9qb1', 'fmeeqcc', 'fmej4u7', 'fmepaax', 'fmepkoc', 'fmeq9px', 'fmeqstx', 'fmers0s', 'fmesyhu', 'fmf0nc6', 'fmf4lh9', 'fmfqnej', 'fmfz12z', 'fmfzpfr', 'fmfzrrc', 'fmg10c9', 'fmg4eiv', 'fmg78il', 'fmg84b3', 'fmg9ez5', 'fmgd0er', 'fmgf0vf', 'fmgl3gr', 'fmglxui', 'fmgmvox', 'fmgn1wu', 'fmgp7v2', 'fmgty4i', 'fmgwg0q', 'fmgwxfl', 'fmh10o4', 'fmhbxn0', 'fmhhgku', 'fmhqhjb', 'fmi0but', 'fmi1u23', 'fmi6ba2', 'fmj3zsl', 'fmjfa0r', 'fmjsoai'];51;1;[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.625, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.875, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.30625;0.5875;0.45582171679287065;0.220439901106855;12.25;23.5

Whether it’s photovoltaics or fusion, sooner or later, human civilization must turn to renewable energies. This is deemed inevitable considering the ever-growing energy demands of humanity and the finite nature of fossil fuels. As such, much research has been pursued in order to develop alternative sources of energy, most of which utilize electricity as the main energy carrier. The extensive R&D in renewables has been accompanied by gradual societal changes as the world adopted new products and devices running on renewables. The most striking change as of recently is the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. While they were hardly seen on the roads even 10 years ago, now millions of electric cars are being sold annually. The electric car market is one of the most rapidly growing sectors, and it helped propel Elon Musk to become the wealthiest man in the world.
Unlike traditional cars which derive energy from the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, electric vehicles rely on batteries as the storage medium for their energy. For a long time, batteries had far lower energy density than those offered by hydrocarbons, which resulted in very low ranges of early electric vehicles. However, gradual improvement in battery technologies eventually allowed the drive ranges of electric cars to be within acceptable levels in comparison to gasoline-burning cars. It is no understatement that the improvement in battery storage technology was one of the main technical bottlenecks which had to be solved in order to kickstart the current electric vehicle revolution.
However, despite the vast improvements in battery technology, today consumers of electric vehicles face another difficulty – slow battery charging speed. Currently, cars take about 10 hours to fully recharge at home. Even the fastest superchargers at the charging stations require up to 20-40 minutes to fully recharge the vehicles. This creates additional costs and inconvenience to the customers.
To address this problem, scientists looked for answers in the mysterious field of quantum physics. Their search has led to the discovery that quantum technologies may promise new mechanisms to charge batteries at a faster rate. Such concept of “quantum battery” has been first proposed in a seminal paper published by Alicki and Fannes in 2012. It was theorized that quantum resources, such as entanglement, can be used to vastly speed up the battery charging process by charging all cells within the battery simultaneously in a collective manner.
This is particularly exciting as modern large-capacity batteries can contain numerous cells. Such collective charging is not possible in classical batteries, where the cells are charged in parallel independently of one another. The advantage of this collective versus parallel charging can be measured by the ratio called the ‘quantum charging advantage’. Later, around the year 2017, it was noticed that there can be two possible sources behind this quantum advantage – namely ‘global operation’ (in which all the cells talk to all others simultaneously, i.e., “all sitting at one table”) and ‘all-to-all coupling’ (every cell can talk with every other, but a single cell, i.e., “many discussions, but every discussion has only two participants”). However, it is unclear whether both these sources are necessary and whether there are any limits to the charging speed that can be achieved.
Recently, scientists from the Center for Theoretical Physics of Complex Systems within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) further explored these questions. The paper, which was chosen as an “Editor’s Suggestion” in the journal Physical Review Letters, showed that all-to-all coupling is irrelevant in quantum batteries and that the presence of global operations is the only ingredient in the quantum advantage. The group went further to pinpoint the exact source of this advantage while ruling out any other possibilities and even provided an explicit way of designing such batteries.
In addition, the group was able to precisely quantify how much charging speed can be achieved in this scheme. While the maximum charging speed increases linearly with the number of cells in classical batteries, the study showed that quantum batteries employing global operation can achieve quadratic scaling in charging speed. To illustrate this, we will consider a typical electric vehicle with a battery that contains about 200 cells. Employing this quantum charging would lead to a 200 times speedup over classical batteries, which means that at home charging time would be cut from 10 hours to about 3 minutes. At high-speed charging stations, the charge time would be cut from 30 minutes to mere seconds.
Researchers say that consequences can be far-reaching and that the implications of quantum charging can go well beyond electric cars and consumer electronics. For example, it may find key uses in future fusion power plants, which require large amounts of energy to be charged and discharged in an instant. Of course, quantum technologies are still in their infancy and there is a long way to go before these methods can be implemented in practice. Research findings such as these, however, create a promising direction and can incentivize the funding agencies and businesses to further invest in these technologies. If employed, it is believed that quantum batteries would completely revolutionize the way we use energy and take us a step closer to our sustainable future.";5573;['i1qryn3', 'i1qvdmo', 'i1r0kv2', 'i1r2ehx', 'i1rgj9o', 'i1rihxt', 'i1rpkdm', 'i1ruep4', 'i1ruf5l', 'i1rx26g', 'i1s1c40', 'i1s5oq0', 'i1s703e', 'i1s8992', 'i1scwyw', 'i1sjfes', 'i1slja7', 'i1stqyn', 'i1sx7vl', 'i1sz4rm', 'i1t1h58', 'i1t2574', 'i1t3ui9', 'i1t4ksj', 'i1t54li', 'i1t5e99', 'i1t5tt0', 'i1t65xn', 'i1t67t4', 'i1t6n7g', 'i1t7qzb', 'i1tcoz3', 'i1tght7', 'i1tm334', 'i1tmut3', 'i1tn8xe', 'i1too43', 'i1tsblg', 'i1u9qcg', 'i1xytn5'];51;1;[0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];[0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.875, 0.0, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0];0.25;0.29375;0.42204857540335333;0.2978438139360964;10.0;11.75

For this reason, and because experiments cannot be shielded from Earth’s gravity, measurements of the gravitational field of a test object are difficult to do in the laboratory — even for objects that have multi-kilogram masses. But writing in Nature, Westphal et al.1 report the detection of the gravitational coupling between two masses of only about 90 milligrams.
The weak, strong and electromagnetic interactions have been unified in the standard model of physics, but the gravitational force cannot be integrated into that model. The best model currently available to describe gravity is the general theory of relativity. This theory has not failed any test so far, but something is odd about it, because it cannot be explained in terms of quantum mechanics.
For most scientific purposes, however, we do not need to use the general theory of relativity to explain gravity — Isaac Newton’s law of universal gravitation2 works perfectly. Published in 1687, Newton’s law states that the gravitational attraction between two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This has proved to be correct not only for describing most astronomical observations, but also in laboratory experiments. For example, the trajectory of a freely falling object (such as an apple falling from a tree) can be measured with a precision of less than ten parts in one billion3, and the results are in good agreement with what would be expected from Newton’s law.
During the twentieth century, however, doubts emerged about the general correctness of this law: an anomalous velocity distribution of stars in galaxies was observed4 in the early 1930s, and could not be explained using Newton’s law alone5. Even the general theory of relativity cannot account for this phenomenon. One explanation is to postulate the existence of dark matter6 — an invisible, but gravity-generating, component of the Universe. However, nobody really knows what this dark matter is made of.
Another explanation, which is controversial but easier to integrate into models than is dark matter, is that Newton’s gravitational law needs a correction. One theory that attempts such a correction was proposed in the 1980s, and is called modified Newtonian dynamics7. The basis of this theory is that gravitational field strength (the acceleration due to gravity) does not follow Newton’s inverse-square law over large distances.
A further mystery is that the gravitational force is about 36 orders of magnitude weaker than the electromagnetic force. This is called the hierarchy problem8.
A framework known as string theory, which was developed in part to provide a quantum-theoretical description of gravity, addresses this problem by proposing that there are more spatial dimensions than the three that we can observe. Gravity — unlike the three other fundamental forces — is assumed to permeate these extra dimensions. If true, then this could explain why the gravitational force is so much weaker than the electromagnetic force9. Another consequence would be that, over a certain spatial range, the gravitational force cannot be described by Newton’s inverse-square law.
A further peculiar thing about gravity is that independent measurements of Newton’s gravitational constant (G, a fundamental constant used in calculations of gravitational effects) have varied broadly10. Experimental determinations of other fundamental constants, such as the Boltzmann constant11 or the speed of light12, have converged as the number and precision of the measurements has increased. This has not happened for G.
Westphal and colleagues’ experiments might take us a step closer to understanding the mysteries of gravity. They have investigated the gravitational force using a miniature version of a torsion balance — a device that was first used by Henry Cavendish in 1798 to measure Earth’s density13 (an experiment that is equivalent to measuring G), and which is still the gold-standard device for determining G14.
A torsion balance consists of a horizontal bar suspended at the middle from a vertically hanging wire, and with test masses attached to the ends. Earth’s gravitational attraction acts in the vertical direction, along which the wire has a large stiffness. But in the horizontal direction, the wire is easily twisted and has a tiny spring constant — very weak forces applied at right angles to the bar cause large rotations of the bar. The balance therefore generates an almost gravity-free environment (more accurately described as a microgravity) in the horizontal plane. This is perfect for detecting small forces, such as the gravitational pull exerted on the bar by a nearby object (the source mass).
In typical determinations of G, the source masses were heavy (several kilograms), to compensate for the weakness of the gravitational force. By contrast, Westphal and co-workers used gold spheres only 92 milligrams in mass (Fig. 1), about the mass of 4 houseflies. This is the lowest source mass ever used in such an experiment.
A calculation using Newton’s law of gravitation shows that the force acting between two spherical masses of 90?mg with a centre-of-mass separation of 2.5 millimetres (approximately the parameters of Westphal and colleagues’ experiment) is only about 9?×?10–14 newtons. This is roughly the same force that acts on a mass of 9 picograms (1?pg is 10–12?g) in Earth’s gravity field; to put that into perspective, 9?pg is about one-third the mass of a human red-blood cell15. The big challenge was therefore to extract this extremely small gravitational signal from background ‘noise’ in the experiment, and from the effects of other forces (such as electromagnetic interactions) that become stronger than gravitational forces when the source and test masses are separated by small distances.
Westphal et al. therefore modulated the signal by periodically varying the position of the source mass with respect to the test mass in the torsion balance. As a consequence of the time-dependent gravitational interaction, the balance oscillated in the horizontal plane at the frequency of the signal modulation (12.7 millihertz). Because the gravitational field of a spherical mass is nonlinear (a consequence of Newton’s inverse-square law), the balance is also stimulated to oscillate at higher frequencies that are multiples of the modulation frequency (known as higher harmonics). This effect could be clearly identified in the experiment, thus providing a signature of the gravitational coupling between the masses.
The detection of such a minuscule gravitational signal is itself an exciting result, but the authors went even further by determining a value for G from their experiment. Their estimate deviates from the internationally agreed value (see go.nature.com/2bwkrqz) by about 9% — a small amount, given that the experimental uncertainties of their system have not yet not been optimized for precise measurements of G. The experiment is therefore the first to show that Newton’s law of gravity holds even for source masses as small as these.
The next step is to push on to even smaller masses — Westphal et al. suggest that gravitational fields of masses of the order of 10–8?kg could eventually be measured. However, much work will need to be done to achieve this goal. The first task will be to substantially reduce damping of the oscillations of the torsion balance, which won’t be easy. But if it can be done, then perhaps quantum gravitational effects will finally be observed.";7983;['gqhw089', 'gqhx6cs', 'gqhyndq', 'gqi0557', 'gqi0pjx', 'gqi4z7n', 'gqigexf', 'gqim0lr', 'gqimqt4', 'gqimzeu', 'gqirei7', 'gqisogx', 'gqitcbm', 'gqiwawi', 'gqixi4v', 'gqiyiqi', 'gqj2xk1', 'gqj7bud', 'gqj7d38', 'gqj9h94', 'gqjbul1', 'gqjjcq8', 'gqjjomp', 'gqjlaw3', 'gqjxvot', 'gqk1m2z', 'gqk2yok', 'gqk4264', 'gqk7x49', 'gqk9x4h', 'gqkcu4u', 'gqkei0g', 'gqkfclq', 'gqkgxpx', 'gqkjkuv', 'gqkm6z3', 'gqkncph', 'gqkq7w6', 'gqkrdqv', 'gqkujbn'];48;1;[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 0.5];0.475;0.540625;0.48989794855663554;0.24904112988620974;19.0;21.625

According to the application, AMD is researching a system that aims to use quantum teleportation to increase a quantum system's reliability, while simultaneously reducing the number of qubits necessary for a given calculation. The aim is to both alleviate scaling problems and calculation errors stemming from system instability.
There are two major hurdles on the road to quantum development and eventual quantum supremacy: scalability and stability. Quantum states are a fickle matter, so sensitive that they can decohere at the slightest provocation -- and a quantum system's sensitivity tends to increase with the presence of more qubits in a given system.
The AMD patent, titled ""Look Ahead Teleportation for Reliable Computation in Multi-SIMD Quantum Processor,"" aims to improve quantum stability, scalability, and performance in novel, more efficient ways. It describes a quantum architecture based on quantum processing regions: areas of the chip that hold or can hold qubits, lying in wait for their turn on the processing pipeline. AMD's approach aims to improve on existing quantum architectures by actually reducing the number of qubits needed to perform complex calculations -- via the science fiction-esque concept of quantum teleportation.
AMD's design aims to teleport qubits across regions, enabling workloads that would theoretically require in-order execution to become capable of being processed in an out-of-order philosophy. As a quick refresher, in-order execution features dependencies between one instruction and the next, meaning that a workload has to be processed sequentially, with later steps dependent on the previous step being fully processed and its result being known before the chip can move ahead with the computation.
As you may imagine, there are chip resources (in this case, qubits) that sit idle until it's their time to perform the next calculation step. On the other hand, Out-of-order execution analyzes a given workload, figures out which parts of it are dependent on previous results and which are not, and executes every step of the instruction that doesn't require a previous result, thus improving performance via increased parallelism.
AMD's patent also includes a look-ahead processor embedded into the architecture,
tasked to analyze the input workload, predict what steps can be tackled in parallel (and those that can't), and appropriately distribute the workload across qubits, using a quantum teleporting technique to deliver them to the required quantum processing, SIMD-based region.
How this quantum teleportation occurs isn't described in the patent -- it looks like AMD is playing its cards close to its chest on this one. Perhaps we're looking at the beginning of AMD's ""Zen 98"" design (that's a joke, to be clear), or maybe this will not materialize in an actual product. But it does show, beyond any doubt and surprising no one, that AMD is indeed working on quantum computing. That seems to be the next great computing race. And while AMD may or may not be backing the right horse to ride toward an eventual victory, at least it seems the company does plan to be a part of the race.";3372;['hb15ebw', 'hb1bi1m', 'hb1i0cp', 'hb26uor', 'hbb7ba5', 'hbbbw4n', 'hbbcfjc', 'hbbfdfb', 'hbblihw', 'hbblyct', 'hbbmmhm', 'hbbttfe', 'hbbwa8n', 'hbbxziw', 'hbby2cn', 'hbc1h5p', 'hbc5fvj', 'hbcaecx', 'hbcbhpi', 'hbcc4tp', 'hbcfgtk', 'hbckmhj', 'hbcmsel', 'hbcrvos', 'hbcxmjo', 'hbdiry7', 'hbdiu9a', 'hbdorx1', 'hbdqscg', 'hbdwd4c', 'hbdx7mh', 'hbe1f5f', 'hbedm9p', 'hbeua44', 'hbezb64', 'hbfgepp', 'hbfpxi1', 'hbfr83l', 'hbfx9fu', 'hbg8h3y'];49;1;[0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0];[1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.75, 0.75, 0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.23125;0.5625;0.40073175254776106;0.270993542358485;9.25;22.5

The Chicago network, which will soon be opened to academia and industry, will become one of the nation’s first publicly-available testbeds for quantum security technology.
The network is now actively running quantum security protocols using technology provided by Toshiba, distributing quantum keys over optic cable at a speed of over 80,000 quantum bits per second between Chicago and the western suburbs. Toshiba’s participation in the project makes the Chicago network a unique collaboration between academia, government and industry.
Researchers will use the Chicago network to test new communication devices, security protocols, and algorithms that will eventually connect distant quantum computers around the nation and the world. The work represents the next step towards a national quantum internet, which will have a profound impact on communications, computing, and national security.
A new 35-mile (56-kilometer) extension has built upon Argonne National Laboratory’s already 89-mile (144-kilometer) quantum loop, launched in 2020. The total network, announced today, is now composed of six nodes and 124 miles (200 kilometers) of optical fiber—transmitting particles carrying quantum-encoded information between the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory in suburban Lemont and two buildings on the South Side of Chicago, one on the UChicago campus and the other at the CQE headquarters in the Hyde Park neighborhood.

“Unless an alien civilization is doing experiments like these right now, anytime this experiment is running at Kyoto University it is making the coldest fermions in the universe,” said Rice University’s Kaden Hazzard, corresponding theory author of astudy published today in Nature Physics. “ Fermions are not rare particles. They include things like electrons and are one of two types of particles that all matter is made of.”
A Kyoto team led by study author Yoshiro Takahashi used lasers to cool its fermions, atoms of ytterbium, within about one-billionth of a degree of absolute zero, the unattainable temperature where all motion stops. That’s about 3 billion times colder than interstellar space, which is still warmed by the afterglow from the Big Bang.
“The payoff of getting this cold is that the physics really changes,” Hazzard said. “The physics starts to become more quantum mechanical, and it lets you see new phenomena.”
Atoms are subject to the laws of quantum dynamics just like electrons and photons, but their quantum behaviors only become evident when they are cooled within a fraction of a degree of absolute zero. Physicists have used laser cooling to study the quantum properties of ultracold atoms for more than a quarter century. Lasers are used to both cool the atoms and restrict their movements to optical lattices, 1D, 2D or 3D channels of light that can serve as quantum simulators capable of solving complex problems beyond the reach of conventional computers.
Takahashi’s lab used optical lattices to simulate a Hubbard model, an oft-used quantum model created in 1963 by theoretical physicist John Hubbard. Physicists use Hubbard models to investigate the magnetic and superconducting behavior of materials, especially those where interactions between electrons produce collective behavior, somewhat like the collective interactions of cheering sports fans who perform “the wave” in crowded stadiums.
“The thermometer they use in Kyoto is one of the important things provided by our theory,” said Hazzard, associate professor of physics and astronomy and a member of the Rice Quantum Initiative. “Comparing their measurements to our calculations, we can determine the temperature. The record-setting temperature is achieved thanks to fun new physics that has to do with the very high symmetry of the system.”
The Hubbard model simulated in Kyoto has special symmetry known as SU(N), where SU stands for special unitary group — a mathematical way of describing the symmetry — and N denotes the possible spin states of particles in the model. The greater the value of N, the greater the model’s symmetry and the complexity of magnetic behaviors it describes. Ytterbium atoms have six possible spin states, and the Kyoto simulator is the first to reveal magnetic correlations in an SU(6) Hubbard model, which are impossible to calculate on a computer.
“That’s the real reason to do this experiment,” Hazzard said. “Because we're dying to know the physics of this SU(N) Hubbard model.”
Study co-author Eduardo Ibarra-García-Padilla, a graduate student in Hazzard’s research group, said the Hubbard model aims to capture the minimal ingredients to understand why solid materials become metals, insulators, magnets or superconductors.
“One of the fascinating questions that experiments can explore is the role of symmetry,” Ibarra-García-Padilla said. “To have the capability to engineer it in a laboratory is extraordinary. If we can understand this, it may guide us to making real materials with new, desired properties.”
Takahashi’s team showed it could trap up to 300,000 atoms in its 3D lattice. Hazzard said accurately calculating the behavior of even a dozen particles in an SU(6) Hubbard model is beyond the reach of the most powerful supercomputers. The Kyoto experiments offer physicists a chance to learn how these complex quantum systems operate by watching them in action.
The results are a major step in this direction, and include the first observations of particle coordination in an SU(6) Hubbard model, Hazzard said.
“Right now this coordination is short-ranged, but as the particles are cooled even further, subtler and more exotic phases of matter can appear,” he said. “One of the interesting things about some of these exotic phases is that they are not ordered in an obvious pattern, and they are also not random. There are correlations, but if you look at two atoms and ask, ‘Are they correlated?' you won't see them. They are much more subtle. You can't look at two or three or even 100 atoms. You kind of have to look at the whole system.”
Physicists don’t yet have tools capable of measuring such behavior in the Kyoto experiment. But Hazzard said work is already underway to create the tools, and the Kyoto team’s success will spur those efforts.
“These systems are pretty exotic and special, but the hope is that by studying and understanding them, we can identify the key ingredients that need to be there in real materials,” he said.

Different colors represent the six possible spin states of each atom. The simulator uses up to 300,000 atoms, allowing physicists to directly observe how particles interact in quantum magnets whose complexity is beyond the reach of even the most powerful supercomputer.

Jeremy has been at the company since 2000.
Right now, we [Dwave Systems] have a 1000 qubit processor in our lab. Dwave has a plan to release it later in 2014. The major thing that’s changing aside from some of the design details is the scale of the problem you can represent, going from a 500-variable graph to a 1000-variable graph. Complexity of that is growing tremendously. [It leads to an] unimaginable exponential blowup of the number of solutions. That scale of problems is getting that much harder for classical algorithms to solve.
[After that] we’re planning to release a 2000-bit processor design. That’s pushing into a scale of territory where we’re tackling problems that are very difficult for people to solve [with conventional methods]. The community is working on getting a few qubits to work at the scale they’re trying to work at.
Dwave saw that between that 128 qubit and 512 qubit, there was a 300,000x improvement in performance. That kind of performance gain is really unprecedented.
There are algorithms related to the factoring problem that can be run on Dwave hardware and they have done some basic work along those lines. It’s simply not a particularly interesting market segment for a business. Dwave has focused on problems that can connect to things like machine learning, financial modeling, logistics and scheduling.

The focus of their worry was what Schrödinger later dubbed entanglement: the inability to describe two quantum systems or particles independently, after they have interacted.
Until his death, Einstein remained convinced that entanglement showed how quantum mechanics was incomplete. Schrödinger thought that entanglement was the defining feature of the new physics, but this didn’t mean that he accepted it lightly. ‘I know of course how the hocus pocus works mathematically,’ he wrote to Einstein on 13 July 1935. ‘But I do not like such a theory.’ Schrödinger’s famous cat, suspended between life and death, first appeared in these letters, a byproduct of the struggle to articulate what bothered the pair.
The problem is that entanglement violates how the world ought to work. Information can’t travel faster than the speed of light, for one. But in a 1935 paper, Einstein and his co-authors showed how entanglement leads to what’s now called quantum nonlocality, the eerie link that appears to exist between entangled particles. If two quantum systems meet and then separate, even across a distance of thousands of lightyears, it becomes impossible to measure the features of one system (such as its position, momentum and polarity) without instantly steering the other into a corresponding state.
Up to today, most experiments have tested entanglement over spatial gaps. The assumption is that the ‘nonlocal’ part of quantum nonlocality refers to the entanglement of properties across space. But what if entanglement also occurs across time? Is there such a thing as temporal nonlocality?
The answer, as it turns out, is yes. Just when you thought quantum mechanics couldn’t get any weirder, a team of physicists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem reported in 2013 that they had successfully entangled photons that never coexisted. Previous experiments involving a technique called ‘entanglement swapping’ had already showed quantum correlations across time, by delaying the measurement of one of the coexisting entangled particles; but Eli Megidish and his collaborators were the first to show entanglement between photons whose lifespans did not overlap at all.
Here’s how they did it. First, they created an entangled pair of photons, ‘1-2’ (step I in the diagram below). Soon after, they measured the polarisation of photon 1 (a property describing the direction of light’s oscillation) – thus ‘killing’ it (step II). Photon 2 was sent on a wild goose chase while a new entangled pair, ‘3-4’, was created (step III). Photon 3 was then measured along with the itinerant photon 2 in such a way that the entanglement relation was ‘swapped’ from the old pairs (‘1-2’ and ‘3-4’) onto the new ‘2-3’ combo (step IV). Some time later (step V), the polarisation of the lone survivor, photon 4, is measured, and the results are compared with those of the long-dead photon 1 (back at step II).
The upshot? The data revealed the existence of quantum correlations between ‘temporally nonlocal’ photons 1 and 4. That is, entanglement can occur across two quantum systems that never coexisted.
What on Earth can this mean? Prima facie, it seems as troubling as saying that the polarity of starlight in the far-distant past – say, greater than twice Earth’s lifetime – nevertheless influenced the polarity of starlight falling through your amateur telescope this winter. Even more bizarrely: maybe it implies that the measurements carried out by your eye upon starlight falling through your telescope this winter somehow dictated the polarity of photons more than 9 billion years old.
Lest this scenario strike you as too outlandish, Megidish and his colleagues can’t resist speculating on possible and rather spooky interpretations of their results. Perhaps the measurement of photon 1’s polarisation at step II somehow steers the future polarisation of 4, or the measurement of photon 4’s polarisation at step V somehow rewrites the past polarisation state of photon 1. In both forward and backward directions, quantum correlations span the causal void between the death of one photon and the birth of the other.
Just a spoonful of relativity helps the spookiness go down, though. In developing his theory of special relativity, Einstein deposed the concept of simultaneity from its Newtonian pedestal. As a consequence, simultaneity went from being an absolute property to being a relative one. There is no single timekeeper for the Universe; precisely when something is occurring depends on your precise location relative to what you are observing, known as your frame of reference. So the key to avoiding strange causal behaviour (steering the future or rewriting the past) in instances of temporal separation is to accept that calling events ‘simultaneous’ carries little metaphysical weight. It is only a frame-specific property, a choice among many alternative but equally viable ones – a matter of convention, or record-keeping.
The lesson carries over directly to both spatial and temporal quantum nonlocality. Mysteries regarding entangled pairs of particles amount to disagreements about labelling, brought about by relativity. Einstein showed that no sequence of events can be metaphysically privileged – can be considered more real – than any other. Only by accepting this insight can one make headway on such quantum puzzles.
The various frames of reference in the Hebrew University experiment (the lab’s frame, photon 1’s frame, photon 4’s frame, and so on) have their own ‘historians’, so to speak. While these historians will disagree about how things went down, not one of them can claim a corner on truth. A different sequence of events unfolds within each one, according to that spatiotemporal point of view. Clearly, then, any attempt at assigning frame-specific properties generally, or tying general properties to one particular frame, will cause disputes among the historians. But here’s the thing: while there might be legitimate disagreement about which properties should be assigned to which particles and when, there shouldn’t be disagreement about the very existence of these properties, particles, and events.
These findings drive yet another wedge between our beloved classical intuitions and the empirical realities of quantum mechanics. As was true for Schrödinger and his contemporaries, scientific progress is going to involve investigating the limitations of certain metaphysical views. Schrödinger’s cat, half-alive and half-dead, was created to illustrate how the entanglement of systems leads to macroscopic phenomena that defy our usual understanding of the relations between objects and their properties: an organism such as a cat is either dead or alive. No middle ground there.
Most contemporary philosophical accounts of the relationship between objects and their properties embrace entanglement solely from the perspective of spatial nonlocality. But there’s still significant work to be done on incorporating temporal nonlocality – not only in object-property discussions, but also in debates over material composition (such as the relation between a lump of clay and the statue it forms), and part-whole relations (such as how a hand relates to a limb, or a limb to a person). For example, the ‘puzzle’ of how parts fit with an overall whole presumes clear-cut spatial boundaries among underlying components, yet spatial nonlocality cautions against this view. Temporal nonlocality further complicates this picture: how does one describe an entity whose constituent parts are not even coexistent?
Discerning the nature of entanglement might at times be an uncomfortable project. It’s not clear what substantive metaphysics might emerge from scrutiny of fascinating new research by the likes of Megidish and other physicists. In a letter to Einstein, Schrödinger notes wryly (and deploying an odd metaphor): ‘One has the feeling that it is precisely the most important statements of the new theory that can really be squeezed into these Spanish boots – but only with difficulty.’ We cannot afford to ignore spatial or temporal nonlocality in future metaphysics: whether or not the boots fit, we’ll have to wear ’em.";8366;['dzoddux', 'dzoiy0w', 'dzozfyr', 'dzozoi2', 'dzp8nqn', 'dzqnz6v', 'e73evvz', 'e73i7mw', 'e73izyh', 'e73jut3', 'e73k9t8', 'e73kll2', 'e73kp88', 'e73l59t', 'e73nk3c', 'e73p0bf', 'e73qx01', 'e73we24', 'e74073e', 'e7409np', 'e740la1', 'e7435jl', 'e74585o', 'e746jop', 'e749p4v', 'e74a7hy', 'e74bkdl', 'e74hz6j', 'e74ihg9', 'e74kkka', 'e74l0sy', 'e74o45f', 'e74uxof', 'e7538zj', 'e7553nb', 'e757ysr', 'e75ixw4', 'e75j7e6', 'e77glmw', 'e78iqsz'];48;1;[1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.875, 0.625, 0.875, 0.5, 0.625, 0.25, 0.625, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 0.5, 0.875, 0.0, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0];0.54375;0.528125;0.4772561550153125;0.2507605618413709;21.75;21.125

VANCOUVER — When the world’s largest defence contractor reportedly paid $10 million for a superfast quantum computer, the Burnaby, B.C., company that built it earned a huge vote of confidence.
Two years after Lockheed Martin acquired the first commercially viable quantum computer from D-Wave Systems, the American aerospace and technology giant is once again throwing its weight behind a technology many thought was still the stuff of science fiction.
Lockheed Martin has just upgraded its D-Wave One quantum computer to the D-Wave Two, a machine the company’s founder Geordie Rose said is 500,000 times faster than its predecessor, which was already faster than a conventional computer.
“I don’t think we would have been able to succeed to the extent that we have without them,” said Rose of Lockheed Martin’s investment.
Quantum computers operate at speeds unattainable by even today’s most powerful supercomputers, operations that are so fast, they can process millions of calculations in a fraction of the months, even years, traditional computers take.
They can even be taught and can recognize objects in images, a task standard computers struggle with.
The computers are so advanced that Ray Johnson, Lockheed’s chief technical officer, told the New York Times his company would use the technology to create and test complex radar, space and aircraft systems.
Rose wouldn’t say how much Lockheed Martin paid for the computer, but several tech blogs put the number at $10 million.
It’s a big win for D-Wave, said Rose, who has battled skeptics who questioned the legitimacy of his quantum technology — a technology he noted no other company is working on today.
If the company continues on the same path, it will release a new, faster commercial processor every two years, said Rose who graduated from the University of British Columbia with a PhD in theoretical physics.
“It will be like the Wright brothers taking off,” he said. “There will be an entirely new thing that wasn’t possible before.”
D-Wave set up in Burnaby because the city was already home to all of its founders, Rose said, and when they looked to expand and considered other cities, the reasons to stay multiplied.
Rose said while he plans to keep D-Wave in Burnaby, he finds it annoying that Metro Vancouver, with all of its obvious positive attributes, doesn’t have more depth in the technology sector.
“Canada has a beautiful system of supporting researchers and the generation of immensely valuable ideas,” said Rose. “But taking the bull by the horns and making it into a hundred-billion-dollar business just doesn’t happen.”";2802;['c99wafw', 'c99wfod', 'c99wxbz', 'c99wyzx', 'c99xl96', 'c99xz16', 'c99zfox', 'c9a1s9j', 'c9a2xao', 'c9a3c3d', 'c9a3cxz', 'c9a3dbv', 'c9a40hw', 'c9a551y', 'c9a5763', 'c9a57b2', 'c9a59b6', 'c9a5ca8', 'c9a5fzp', 'c9a5qbx', 'c9a5td7', 'c9a5w2q', 'c9a5y0x', 'c9a5ymr', 'c9a5zlm', 'c9a677r', 'c9a6865', 'c9a68be', 'c9a6a6q', 'c9a6cu4', 'c9a6e0o', 'c9a6jpu', 'c9a6k98', 'c9a6odg', 'c9a78f9', 'c9a7rj4', 'c9a935m', 'c9a9evv', 'c9ab1k8', 'c9ab47b'];47;1;[1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0];[0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.625, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.225;0.496875;0.3864906208435077;0.28018897083040223;9.0;19.875

How serious is this risk and is anyone doing anything to fix it?'];[nan];2021-08-21;Billy Bambrough;‘Urgent’ Warning Issued Over The Future Of Bitcoin Even As The Crypto Market Price Smashes Past $2 Trillion;"Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have seen a huge resurgence over the last year following the brutal so-called crypto winter that began in 2018.
The bitcoin price has this year climbed to never-before-seen highs, topping $60,000 per bitcoin before falling back slightly. Other smaller cryptocurrencies have risen at an even faster clip than bitcoin, with many making percentage gains into the thousands.
Now, as bitcoin and cryptocurrencies begin to carve out a place among traditional assets in investor portfolios, technologists have warned that advances in quantum computing could mean the encryption that underpins bitcoin is ""fundamentally"" undermined as soon as 2026—unless the software is updated.
""Quantum computers, expected to be operational by around 2026, will easily undermine any blockchain security systems because of their power,"" says the founder of quantum encryption company Arqit, David Williams, speaking over the phone. Arqit is gearing up for a September SPAC listing in New York.
""There needs to be rather more urgency,"" Williams adds.
Quantum computing, which sees traditional computer ""bits"" replaced with quantum particles (qubits) that can calculate information at vastly increased speed, has been in development since the 1990s. Researchers at universities around the world are now on the verge of creating a working quantum computer, with search giant Google and scientists from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, recently making headlines with breakthroughs.
Williams, pointing to problems previously identified by the cofounder of ethereum and creator of cardano, Charles Hoskinson, warns that upgrading to post-quantum algorithms will ""dramatically slow blockchains down"" and called for blockchain developers to adopt so-called quantum encryption keys.
""Blockchains are effectively fundamentally flawed if they don’t address the oncoming quantum age. The grownups in the room know what's coming.""
Others have also begun working on getting bitcoin and other blockchains ahead of quantum computing.
""If this isn't addressed before quantum computers pose a threat, the impact would be massive,"" says Duncan Jones, head of quantum cybersecurity at Cambridge Quantum Computing, speaking via email. ""Attackers could create fraudulent transactions and steal currency, as well as potentially disrupting blockchain operations.""
Earlier this month, Cambridge Quantum Computing, along with the Inter-American Development Bank and Tecnológico de Monterrey, identified four potential threats to blockchain networks posed by quantum computers and used a post-quantum cryptography layer to help protect them, including a new generation of quantum-proof cryptographic keys.
""Time is of the essence here,"" says Jones, pointing to Google chief executive Sundar Pichai's prediction that encryption could be broken in as little as five to 10 years. ""It's important for decentralized networks to start this migration process soon because it requires careful planning and execution. However, I'm hopeful the core developers behind these platforms understand the issues and will be addressing them.""
Recently, it's been reported that China is pulling ahead in the global quantum race, something Williams fears could undermine both traditional and crypto markets to the same degree as the 2008 global financial crisis.
""On day one, the creation of a quantum computer doesn't break everything,"" says Williams. ""It will probably initially happen in secret and the information will slowly leak out that the cryptography has been broken. Then there will be a complete loss of confidence, similar to how the global financial crisis saw confidence in the system disintegrate.""
With more than 11,000 different cryptocurrencies now listed on crypto data website CoinMarketCap and competition between bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies reaching fever pitch, adding protection against the coming quantum revolution could be beneficial.
""If any one blockchain company could deliver proof it's quantum-safe it would have an advantage,"" says Williams.";4070;['h9zrf7k', 'h9zrixc', 'h9zrizz', 'h9zrjuz', 'h9zrlfc', 'h9zrvge', 'h9zrwee', 'h9zs7mp', 'h9zsese', 'h9zsy7v', 'h9zt13o', 'h9zt4mn', 'h9zt7pw', 'h9zuapz', 'h9zue14', 'h9zui8q', 'h9zujy4', 'h9zuspc', 'h9zuxkq', 'h9zw5m7', 'h9zx37d', 'h9zxzd5', 'h9zy932', 'h9zyegi', 'h9zyf3m', 'ha00r1d', 'ha01xc1', 'ha03d92', 'ha05ijj', 'ha05n1l', 'ha0805n', 'ha0am3f', 'ha0au94', 'ha0e0xq', 'ha0o8yl', 'ha1hd6f', 'ha2tjek', 'ha3gcmj', 'ha48d5z', 'hc5jhq4'];45;1;[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.75, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.75, 1.0];[1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.625, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.375, 0.125, 0.125, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.125, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0];0.4375;0.496875;0.4357106264483344;0.34740949810706095;17.5;19.875

These quantum dots produce clean hydrogen fuel from water and sunlight – a sustainable source of energy. They introduce new eco-friendly and powerful materials to solar photocatalysis.
Quantum dots are true all-rounders. These material structures, which are only a few nanometers in size, display a similar behavior to that of molecules or atoms, and their form, size and number of electrons can be modulated systematically. This means that their electrical and optical characteristics can be customized for a number of target areas, such as new display technologies, biomedical applications as well as photovoltaics and photocatalysis.
Fuel production using sunlight and water
Another current line of application-oriented research aims to generate hydrogen directly from water and solar light. Hydrogen, a clean and efficient energy source, can be converted into forms of fuel that are used widely, including methanol and gasoline. The most promising types of quantum dots previously used in energy research contain cadmium, which has been banned from many commodities due to its toxicity. The team of Greta Patzke, Professor at the Department of Chemistry of the University of Zurich (UZH), and scientists from Southwest Petroleum University in Chengdu and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have now developed a new type of nanomaterials without toxic components for photocatalysis.
Indium-containing core with a thin layer of zinc sulfide
The three-nanometer particles consist of a core of indium phosphide with a very thin surrounding layer of zinc sulfide and sulfide ligands. “Compared to the quantum dots that contain cadmium, the new composites are not only environmentally friendly, but also highly efficient when it comes to producing hydrogen from light and water,” explains Greta Patzke. Sulfide ligands on the quantum dot surface were found to facilitate the crucial steps involved in light-driven chemical reactions, namely the efficient separation of charge carriers and their rapid transfer to the nanoparticle surface.
Great potential for eco-friendly applications
The newly developed cadmium-free nanomaterials have the potential to serve as a more eco-friendly alternative for a variety of commercial fields. “The water-soluble and biocompatible indium-based quantum dots can in the future also be tested in terms of biomass conversion to hydrogen.

It often feels like electronics will continue to get faster forever, but at some point the laws of physics will intervene to put a stop to that. Now scientists have calculated the ultimate speed limit – the point at which quantum mechanics prevents microchips from getting any faster.
It’s well known that nothing moves faster than light, and that holds true for electronics – systems that use light to control electricity, known as optoelectronics, are the fastest devices. And in the new study, researchers from TU Wien, TU Graz and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics have identified the upper limit for how fast optoelectronics could possibly get.
The team conducted experiments using semiconductor materials and lasers. The semiconductor is hit with an ultra-short laser pulse, which shifts electrons in the material into a higher energy state, allowing them to move around freely. Then, a second, slightly longer laser pulse sends them shooting off in a certain direction, producing an electrical current.
Using this technique, as well as complex computer simulations, the team hit semiconductors with shorter and shorter laser pulses. But at a certain point, the process begins to bump up against Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle – this is the strange quantum quirk where the more accurately you measure one characteristic of a particle, the less you can be sure of another.
In this case, using shorter laser pulses means the observers can tell exactly when the electrons gain energy, but that comes at the cost of being less certain about the amount of energy they gain. And that’s a major problem for electronic devices, because not knowing the exact energies of electrons means they can’t be controlled as precisely.
From this, the team calculated the absolute upper limit for how fast optoelectronic systems could possibly ever get – one Petahertz, which is a million Gigahertz. That’s a hard limit, one that can’t be engineered around because the barrier is baked into the very laws of quantum physics.
Of course, it’s unlikely we’ll ever actually have to directly worry about that anyway. The team says that other technological hurdles would arise long before optoelectronic devices reach the realm of PHz. But understanding the hard limit could help develop better electronics.";2366;['i2hw8ma', 'i2i5idw', 'i2i6u1v', 'i2i75pt', 'i2i8yle', 'i2i9wzx', 'i2ifcha', 'i2iiuht', 'i2ilbcb', 'i2imjrx', 'i2ioib1', 'i2ipyje', 'i2ixe7i', 'i2izfbl', 'i2j01xb', 'i2j2mm1', 'i2j3d63', 'i2j66zp', 'i2jcc5o', 'i2jds7m', 'i2jea9z', 'i2jh42p', 'i2jh62c', 'i2jkrkb', 'i2jmekg', 'i2jqfdv', 'i2ju95s', 'i2julwq', 'i2jylgw', 'i2k2k7p', 'i2k6xdm', 'i2k8j2o', 'i2kayx3', 'i2kdury', 'i2koe4v', 'i2kt8ga', 'i2ldudi', 'i2levlk', 'i2lrfhj', 'i2m5avu'];45;1;[1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.75, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.375, 0.25, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.625, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.38125;0.525;0.4506505713965089;0.23251344047172845;15.25;21.0

A device that eavesdrops on the quantum whispers of atoms could form the basis of a new type of quantum computer.
Stanford physicists have developed a “quantum microphone” so sensitive that it can measure individual particles of sound, called phonons.
The device, which is detailed July 24 in the journal Nature, could eventually lead to smaller, more efficient quantum computers that operate by manipulating sound rather than light.
“We expect this device to allow new types of quantum sensors, transducers and storage devices for future quantum machines,” said study leader Amir Safavi-Naeini, an assistant professor of applied physics at Stanford’s School of Humanities and Sciences.
Quantum of motion
First proposed by Albert Einstein in 1907, phonons are packets of vibrational energy emitted by jittery atoms. These indivisible packets, or quanta, of motion manifest as sound or heat, depending on their frequencies.
Like photons, which are the quantum carriers of light, phonons are quantized, meaning their vibrational energies are restricted to discrete values – similar to how a staircase is composed of distinct steps.
“Sound has this granularity that we don’t normally experience,” Safavi-Naeini said. “Sound, at the quantum level, crackles.”
The energy of a mechanical system can be represented as different “Fock” states – 0, 1, 2, and so on – based on the number of phonons it generates. For example, a “1 Fock state” consist of one phonon of a particular energy, a “2 Fock state” consists of two phonons with the same energy, and so on. Higher phonon states correspond to louder sounds.
Until now, scientists have been unable to measure phonon states in engineered structures directly because the energy differences between states – in the staircase analogy, the spacing between steps – is vanishingly small. “One phonon corresponds to an energy ten trillion trillion times smaller than the energy required to keep a lightbulb on for one second,” said graduate student Patricio Arrangoiz-Arriola, a co-first author of the study.
To address this issue, the Stanford team engineered the world’s most sensitive microphone – one that exploits quantum principles to eavesdrop on the whispers of atoms.
In an ordinary microphone, incoming sound waves jiggle an internal membrane, and this physical displacement is converted into a measurable voltage. This approach doesn’t work for detecting individual phonons because, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, a quantum object’s position can’t be precisely known without changing it.
“If you tried to measure the number of phonons with a regular microphone, the act of measurement injects energy into the system that masks the very energy that you’re trying to measure,” Safavi-Naeini said.
Instead, the physicists devised a way to measure Fock states – and thus, the number of phonons – in sound waves directly. “Quantum mechanics tells us that position and momentum can’t be known precisely – but it says no such thing about energy,” Safavi-Naeini said. “Energy can be known with infinite precision.”
Singing qubits
The quantum microphone the group developed consists of a series of supercooled nanomechanical resonators, so small that they are visible only through an electron microscope. The resonators are coupled to a superconducting circuit that contains electron pairs that move around without resistance. The circuit forms a quantum bit, or qubit, that can exist in two states at once and has a natural frequency, which can be read electronically. When the mechanical resonators vibrate like a drumhead, they generate phonons in different states.
“The resonators are formed from periodic structures that act like mirrors for sound. By introducing a defect into these artificial lattices, we can trap the phonons in the middle of the structures,” Arrangoiz-Arriola said.
Like unruly inmates, the trapped phonons rattle the walls of their prisons, and these mechanical motions are conveyed to the qubit by ultra-thin wires. “The qubit’s sensitivity to displacement is especially strong when the frequencies of the qubit and the resonators are nearly the same,” said joint first-author Alex Wollack, also a graduate student at Stanford.
However, by detuning the system so that the qubit and the resonators vibrate at very different frequencies, the researchers weakened this mechanical connection and triggered a type of quantum interaction, known as a dispersive interaction, that directly links the qubit to the phonons.
This bond causes the frequency of the qubit to shift in proportion to the number of phonons in the resonators. By measuring the qubit’s changes in tune, the researchers could determine the quantized energy levels of the vibrating resonators – effectively resolving the phonons themselves.
“Different phonon energy levels appear as distinct peaks in the qubit spectrum,” Safavi-Naeini said. “These peaks correspond to Fock states of 0, 1, 2 and so on. These multiple peaks had never been seen before.”
Mechanical quantum mechanical
Mastering the ability to precisely generate and detect phonons could help pave the way for new kinds of quantum devices that are able to store and retrieve information encoded as particles of sound or that can convert seamlessly between optical and mechanical signals.
Such devices could conceivably be made more compact and efficient than quantum machines that use photons, since phonons are easier to manipulate and have wavelengths that are thousands of times smaller than light particles.
“Right now, people are using photons to encode these states. We want to use phonons, which brings with it a lot of advantages,” Safavi-Naeini said. “Our device is an important step toward making a ‘mechanical quantum mechanical’ computer.”";5829;['euxeq7g', 'euxf7zg', 'euxkf5i', 'euxo8kj', 'euxpsej', 'euxv49m', 'euy5yu2', 'euybt5l', 'euyfyjj', 'euyi8st', 'euyivrp', 'euym16d', 'euyn8g8', 'euypm6c', 'euyrek5', 'euys066', 'euysafu', 'euz7mjj', 'ev0rq1k', 'ev1ahfn', 'ev1h0e6', 'ev1km4g', 'ev99w59', 'ev9clgu', 'ev9lkbc', 'ev9u9iq', 'ev9vjte', 'ev9zfgu', 'eva2eie', 'eva5n76', 'eva7put', 'evaa900', 'evagcpd', 'evaijsx', 'evajvn4', 'evavidj', 'evb8ws9', 'evbngnh', 'evbpwzx', 'evbsgqz'];46;1;[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 0.0, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 0.625, 0.375, 0.5, 0.125, 0.375, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5];0.54375;0.45;0.4706627640891088;0.2663409469082815;21.75;18.0

You won’t know if it’s happening until it’s too late, Professor Jintao Ding of Tsinghua University, a US citizen, explained. And the best thing about hacking Bitcoin, he explained, is that it isn’t against the law.
Crypto analysts have worried about the quantum invasion for some time. Motley Fool’s Zhiyuan Sun wrote in September, “The rise of quantum computing may soon give governments a means to crack down on Bitcoin and other types of cryptocurrencies… Governments could potentially decrypt digital currencies or launch hash attacks to take over their network for a regulatory shutdown with these machines.”
“Most governments like Bitcoin as much as we like walking with rocks in our shoes,” Sun added. No government dislikes Bitcoin as much as China, which banned onshore trading of cryptocurrencies in 2019 and forbade Chinese from trading on offshore crypto exchanges last September.
“Our modern information system relies completely on public key cryptography, including Bitcoin,” Ding told the “Data Wars” webinar, co-sponsored by the American Affairs journal and Asia Times. “If we have a quantum computer, our Zoom would be finished, and everything actually—the whole information system, because our fundamental security solution relies on it.”
Public key cryptography based on the RSA standard has been in use since the late 1970s. Each user has a public key for purposes of identification, and a private key – a password – for decryption.
The public key is based on two very large prime numbers, which are secret; only the recipient knows the prime numbers, which are required to decrypt the message. Factoring extremely large numbers into primes, decrypting the private key requires factoring extremely large numbers into primes, something that takes supercomputers a very long time to do.
As computers get faster, cryptography uses bigger numbers. But quantum computers will be able to factor extremely large numbers into primes very quickly. Maybe they already can—but if that’s the case, no one is saying so yet.
Today’s encryption methods “can be broken by quantum computers. We must work together to have a smooth transition from the current situation and find a solution. We have to do it. And the transition process will be very difficult,” Ding added.
Mathematicians have known that quantum computers would be able to break the RSA code quickly since 1994, when Peter Shor published an algorithm for factoring extremely large numbers into primes.
Development of such a quantum computer is inevitable, Ding argues. There are rumors in the tech world that machines capable of using Shor’s algorithm to break RSA already exist.
When will that happen? It might have happened already, but if it has, no-one will let on, Ding explained.
“Watch the movie ‘Imitation Game’ about [Alan] Turing,” the great British mathematician who led the team that broke the German Enigma code during World War II. British signals intelligence (GCHQ) didn’t reveal until the 1970s that it could read German coded messages in close to real time during World War II. “If I can read every message, why wouldn’t I keep quiet about it? I would be in a very good position. I think this is what I would do,” he said.
In 2019, I serialized a spy thriller in Asia Times under the title, The Quantum Supremacy, premised on just such a scenario.
What does that mean for Bitcoin? I asked Ding during the webinar.
He replied: “That’s a very good question. In my opinion, once you have a quantum computer, blockchain and Bitcoin are finished. Let me expand a bit. You don’t own Bitcoin. The owner is your private key. When they give you the money, they give it to an address. The address is a short form of your public key. They use that to verify the address. Only you have the private key; everyone knows the public key to verify that it is from you.”
“When they give you the money, they give it to an address,” Ding said. “ The address is a short form of your public key. We use that to verify when you give me the coins. But if I don’t know the private part key, if I only know the address. I cannot take anything.”
“But if I have a quantum computer,” Ding continued, “what I would do first is to get all the coins, because there’s no liability there. I wouldn’t attack banks—then there’s a big lawsuit, or you go to jail. But with a quantum computer, I just take the Bitcoin. It’s legal in my opinion. I didn’t do anything; I just see your public key and use your private key and assign the money to my own account.”
That’s the downside of anonymity. Your name and government ID number aren’t linked to a Bitcoin account (as they are to an ordinary bank account). Your proof of ownership is simply the fact that you have the private key (your password). If someone else hacks that, you have no legal recourse.
Bitcoins have another vulnerability, Ding said. “When I do a transaction, there’s 10 minutes delay because we have to confirm the transaction. In this period, if your transaction is delayed, if people have a quantum computer, then they can do a new transaction to replace your transaction, and then they can send it all the funds to themselves. Then you’re finished. They can just take all your Bitcoin right away.”
The professor doesn’t think that the cryptocurrency world’s efforts to enhance security will do much good. “Bitcoin did an update called Taproot,” he said. “This is actually very bad because in this case, because they are very much prone to attack from content within it.” Taproot creates an interface between Bitcoin and ordinary cash transactions, in order to reduce transaction costs.
If quantum computers capable of hacking your crypto account exist, they are in the hands of governments or large corporations with the resources to build them. If and when such quantum computers are functional, their owners won’t draw attention by stealing from individual bitcoin accounts.

What's more, the prototype NIST refrigerator, which measures a few inches in outer dimensions, enables researchers to place any suitable object in the cooling zone and later remove and replace it, similar to an all-purpose kitchen refrigerator. The cooling power is the equivalent of a window-mounted air conditioner cooling a building the size of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
""It's one of the most flabbergasting results I've seen,"" project leader Joel Ullom says. ""We used quantum mechanics in a nanostructure to cool a block of copper. The copper is about a million times heavier than the refrigerating elements. This is a rare example of a nano- or microelectromechanical machine that can manipulate the macroscopic world.""
The technology may offer a compact, convenient means of chilling advanced sensors below standard cryogenic temperatures—300 milliKelvin (mK), typically achieved by use of liquid helium—to enhance their performance in quantum information systems, telescope cameras, and searches for mysterious dark matter and dark energy.
As described in Applied Physics Letters, the NIST refrigerator's cooling elements, consisting of 48 tiny sandwiches of specific materials, chilled a plate of copper, 2.5 centimeters on a side and 3 millimeters thick, from 290 mK to 256 mK. The cooling process took about 18 hours. NIST researchers expect that minor improvements will enable faster and further cooling to about 100 mK.
The cooling elements are sandwiches of a normal metal, a 1-nanometer-thick insulating layer, and a superconducting metal. When a voltage is applied, the hottest electrons ""tunnel"" from the normal metal through the insulator to the superconductor. The temperature in the normal metal drops dramatically and drains electronic and vibrational energy from the object being cooled.
NIST researchers previously demonstrated this basic cooling method but are now able to cool larger objects that can be easily attached and removed. Researchers developed a micromachining process to attach the cooling elements to the copper plate, which is designed to be a stage on which other objects can be attached and cooled. Additional advances include better thermal isolation of the stage, which is suspended by strong, cold-tolerant cords.
Cooling to temperatures below 300 mK currently requires complex, large and costly apparatus. NIST researchers want to build simple, compact alternatives to make it easier to cool NIST's advanced sensors. Researchers plan to boost the cooling power of the prototype refrigerator by adding more and higher-efficiency superconducting junctions and building a more rigid support structure.";2890;['c8sug51', 'c8svdi1', 'c8swnpl', 'c8swnvn', 'c8sy56g', 'c8syd4p', 'c8syl1c', 'c8synj1', 'c8sz59x', 'c8sz669', 'c8sz66y', 'c8szibf', 'c8szkyk', 'c8szqtb', 'c8szslp', 'c8szuu6', 'c8t018p', 'c8t07ww', 'c8t0g9a', 'c8t0hgi', 'c8t0j2k', 'c8t0psn', 'c8t0vts', 'c8t12ji', 'c8t176u', 'c8t1n92', 'c8t1nzs', 'c8t1qpe', 'c8t1upt', 'c8t25dt', 'c8t26jc', 'c8t2b8p', 'c8t2vr5', 'c8t2w1h', 'c8t671t', 'c8t7jfx', 'c8t7lbu', 'c8ta02j', 'c8tan05', 'c8tjpef'];45;1;[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.75];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.375, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5];0.375;0.6125;0.45414755311462374;0.25890393971509973;15.0;24.5

The result eliminates one of the best examples of quantum speedup.'];[nan];2018-07-31;Kevin Hartnett July;Major Quantum Computing Advance Made Obsolete by Teenager | Quanta Magazine;"A teenager from Texas has taken quantum computing down a notch. In a paper posted online earlier this month, 18-year-old Ewin Tang proved that ordinary computers can solve an important computing problem with performance potentially comparable to that of a quantum computer.
In its most practical form, the “recommendation problem” relates to how services like Amazon and Netflix determine which products you might like to try. Computer scientists had considered it to be one of the best examples of a problem that’s exponentially faster to solve on quantum computers — making it an important validation of the power of these futuristic machines. Now Tang has stripped that validation away.
“This was one of the most definitive examples of a quantum speedup, and it’s no longer there,” said Tang, who graduated from the University of Texas, Austin, in spring and will begin a Ph.D. at the University of Washington in the fall.
In 2014, at age 14 and after skipping the fourth through sixth grades, Tang enrolled at UT Austin and majored in mathematics and computer science. In the spring of 2017 Tang took a class on quantum information taught by Scott Aaronson, a prominent researcher in quantum computing. Aaronson recognized Tang as an unusually talented student and offered himself as adviser on an independent research project. Aaronson gave Tang a handful of problems to choose from, including the recommendation problem. Tang chose it somewhat reluctantly.
“I was hesitant because it seemed like a hard problem when I looked at it, but it was the easiest of the problems he gave me,” Tang said.
The recommendation problem is designed to give a recommendation for products that users will like. Consider the case of Netflix. It knows what films you’ve watched. It knows what all of its other millions of users have watched. Given this information, what are you likely to want to watch next?
You can think of this data as being arranged in a giant grid, or matrix, with movies listed across the top, users listed down the side, and values at points in the grid quantifying whether, or to what extent, each user likes each film. A good algorithm would generate recommendations by quickly and accurately recognizing similarities between movies and users and filling in the blanks in the matrix.
In 2016 the computer scientists Iordanis Kerenidis and Anupam Prakash published a quantum algorithm that solved the recommendation problem exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm. They achieved this quantum speedup in part by simplifying the problem: Instead of filling out the entire matrix and identifying the single best product to recommend, they developed a way of sorting users into a small number of categories — do they like blockbusters or indie films? — and sampling the existing data in order to generate a recommendation that was simply good enough.
At the time of Kerenidis and Prakash’s work, there were only a few examples of problems that quantum computers seemed to be able to solve exponentially faster than classical computers. Most of those examples were specialized — they were narrow problems designed to play to the strengths of quantum computers (these include the “forrelation” problem Quanta covered earlier this year). Kerenidis and Prakash’s result was exciting because it provided a real-world problem people cared about where quantum computers outperformed classical ones.
“To my sense it was one of the first examples in machine learning and big data where we showed quantum computers can do something that we still don’t know how to do classically,” said Kerenidis, a computer scientist at the Research Institute on the Foundations of Computer Science in Paris.
Kerenidis and Prakash proved that a quantum computer could solve the recommendation problem exponentially faster than any known algorithm, but they didn’t prove that a fast classical algorithm couldn’t exist. So when Aaronson began working with Tang in 2017, that was the question he posed — prove there is no fast classical recommendation algorithm, and thereby confirm Kerenidis and Prakash’s quantum speedup is real.
“That seemed to me like an important ‘t’ to cross to complete this story,” said Aaronson, who believed at the time that no fast classical algorithm existed.
Tang set to work in the fall of 2017, intending for the recommendation problem to serve as a senior thesis. For several months Tang struggled to prove that a fast classical algorithm was impossible. As time went on, Tang started to think that maybe such an algorithm was possible after all.
“I started believing there is a fast classical algorithm, but I couldn’t really prove it to myself because Scott seemed to think there wasn’t one, and he was the authority,” Tang said.
Finally, with the senior thesis deadline bearing down, Tang wrote to Aaronson and admitted a growing suspicion: “Tang wrote to me saying, actually, ‘I think there is a fast classical algorithm,’” Aaronson said.
Throughout the spring Tang wrote up the results and worked with Aaronson to clarify some steps in the proof. The fast classical algorithm Tang found was directly inspired by the fast quantum algorithm Kerenidis and Prakash had found two years earlier. Tang showed that the kind of quantum sampling techniques they used in their algorithm could be replicated in a classical setting. Like Kerenidis and Prakash’s algorithm, Tang’s algorithm ran in polylogarithmic time — meaning the computational time scaled with the logarithm of characteristics like the number of users and products in the data set — and was exponentially faster than any previously known classical algorithm.
Once Tang had completed the algorithm, Aaronson wanted to be sure it was correct before releasing it publicly. “I was still nervous that once Tang put the paper online, if it’s wrong, the first big paper of [Tang’s] career would go splat,” Aaronson said.
Aaronson had been planning to attend a quantum computing workshop at the University of California, Berkeley, in June. Many of the biggest names in the field were going to be there, including Kerenidis and Prakash. Aaronson invited Tang to come out to Berkeley to informally present the algorithm in the days after the official conference ended.
On the mornings of June 18 and 19 Tang gave two lectures while fielding questions from the audience. By the end of four hours, a consensus emerged: Tang’s classical algorithm seemed correct. What many people in the room didn’t realize, however, was just how young the speaker was. “I did not know Ewin was 18, and I certainly did not get that from the talk. To me [Ewin] was someone who was giving a very mature talk,” Kerenidis said. The algorithm now faces a formal peer review before publication.
For quantum computing, Tang’s result is a setback. Or not. Tang has eliminated one of the clearest, best examples of a quantum advantage. At the same time, Tang’s paper is further evidence of the fruitful interplay between the study of quantum and classical algorithms.
“Tang is killing [Kerenidis and Prakash’s] quantum speedup, but then in another sense Tang is giving a big improvement and building on what they did. Tang never would have come up with this classical algorithm but for their quantum algorithm,” Aaronson said.";7276;['e3e4eov', 'e3ek1ze', 'e3ekyso', 'e3enhxu', 'e3eou1g', 'e3etd83', 'e3eug1w', 'e3fl8v3', 'e3g4zr8', 'e3g59bs', 'e3g6oid', 'e3g78w4', 'e3g899b', 'e3ge1m8', 'e3ggzql', 'e3ghk54', 'e3gicw6', 'e3gifdk', 'e3gm4m1', 'e3go6x8', 'e3gpixj', 'e3gw6mv', 'e3h63e7', 'e3h71wg', 'e3h7a2t', 'e3hkfn7', 'e3hkhzp', 'e3hno9o', 'e3hrdua', 'e3j2eub', 'e3jsn69', 'e3n2y78', 'fy93icn', 'fy94208', 'fy9tjka', 'fya2t7m', 'fya6o07', 'fyaz1yb', 'fyb8203', 'fyb95e7'];45;1;[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0];[1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 1.0, 0.375, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5];0.34375;0.559375;0.4318835925339142;0.2917987052318773;13.75;22.375

A team of physicists from the Harvard-MIT Center for Ultracold Atoms and other universities has developed a special type of quantum computer known as a programmable quantum simulator capable of operating with 256 quantum bits, or “qubits.”
The system marks a major step toward building large-scale quantum machines that could be used to shed light on a host of complex quantum processes and eventually help bring about real-world breakthroughs in material science, communication technologies, finance, and many other fields, overcoming research hurdles that are beyond the capabilities of even the fastest supercomputers today. Qubits are the fundamental building blocks on which quantum computers run and the source of their massive processing power.
“This moves the field into a new domain where no one has ever been to thus far,” said Mikhail Lukin, the George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Physics, co-director of the Harvard Quantum Initiative, and one of the senior authors of the study published on July 7, 2021, in the journal Nature. “We are entering a completely new part of the quantum world.”
According to Sepehr Ebadi, a physics student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the study’s lead author, it is the combination of system’s unprecedented size and programmability that puts it at the cutting edge of the race for a quantum computer, which harnesses the mysterious properties of matter at extremely small scales to greatly advance processing power. Under the right circumstances, the increase in qubits means the system can store and process exponentially more information than the classical bits on which standard computers run.
“The number of quantum states that are possible with only 256 qubits exceeds the number of atoms in the solar system,” Ebadi said, explaining the system’s vast size.
Already, the simulator has allowed researchers to observe several exotic quantum states of matter that had never before been realized experimentally, and to perform a quantum phase transition study so precise that it serves as the textbook example of how magnetism works at the quantum level.
These experiments provide powerful insights on the quantum physics underlying material properties and can help show scientists how to design new materials with exotic properties.
The project uses a significantly upgraded version of a platform the researchers developed in 2017, which was capable of reaching a size of 51 qubits. That older system allowed the researchers to capture ultra-cold rubidium atoms and arrange them in a specific order using a one-dimensional array of individually focused laser beams called optical tweezers.
This new system allows the atoms to be assembled in two-dimensional arrays of optical tweezers. This increases the achievable system size from 51 to 256 qubits. Using the tweezers, researchers can arrange the atoms in defect-free patterns and create programmable shapes like square, honeycomb, or triangular lattices to engineer different interactions between the qubits.
“The workhorse of this new platform is a device called the spatial light modulator, which is used to shape an optical wavefront to produce hundreds of individually focused optical tweezer beams,” said Ebadi. “These devices are essentially the same as what is used inside a computer projector to display images on a screen, but we have adapted them to be a critical component of our quantum simulator.”
The initial loading of the atoms into the optical tweezers is random, and the researchers must move the atoms around to arrange them into their target geometries. The researchers use a second set of moving optical tweezers to drag the atoms to their desired locations, eliminating the initial randomness. Lasers give the researchers complete control over the positioning of the atomic qubits and their coherent quantum manipulation.
Other senior authors of the study include Harvard Professors Subir Sachdev and Markus Greiner, who worked on the project along with Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Vladan Vuleti?, and scientists from Stanford, the University of California Berkeley, the University of Innsbruck in Austria, the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and QuEra Computing Inc. in Boston.
“Our work is part of a really intense, high-visibility global race to build bigger and better quantum computers,” said Tout Wang, a research associate in physics at Harvard and one of the paper’s authors. “The overall effort [beyond our own] has top academic research institutions involved and major private-sector investment from Google, IBM, Amazon, and many others.”
The researchers are currently working to improve the system by improving laser control over qubits and making the system more programmable. They are also actively exploring how the system can be used for new applications, ranging from probing exotic forms of quantum matter to solving challenging real-world problems that can be naturally encoded on the qubits.
“This work enables a vast number of new scientific directions,” Ebadi said. “We are nowhere near the limits of what can be done with these systems.”";5192;['h53eurx', 'h53fi2u', 'h53gjhn', 'h53o45d', 'h53pvw2', 'h53q2dw', 'h53r77v', 'h53weh3', 'h53wv8v', 'h53zfrz', 'h53zm2l', 'h5417nw', 'h541upk', 'h543btm', 'h543icc', 'h547wu5', 'h54bp1v', 'h54f5uz', 'h54jial', 'h54ktjr', 'h54m6r0', 'h54mjcr', 'h54ms5p', 'h54mzvo', 'h54pswn', 'h54xkdu', 'h552m8m', 'h555ip2', 'h55avhz', 'h55ui2z', 'h561efp', 'h565lby', 'h5677o5', 'h56lrmq', 'h574rc7', 'h574tvb', 'h5781jk', 'h57pg5t', 'h583rta', 'h58xw4l'];45;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.625, 0.5, 0.75, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5];0.21875;0.465625;0.39205986468905485;0.26807691876586465;8.75;18.625

Researchers working in Calgary, Canada and Hefei, China, used existing fiber optics networks to transmit small units of information across cities via quantum entanglement — Einstein's ""spooky action at a distance.""
Stepping Outside the Lab
According to quantum mechanics, some objects, like photons or electrons, can be entangled. This means that no matter how far apart they are, what happens to one will affect the other instantaneously. To Einstein, this seemed ridiculous, because it entailed information moving faster than the speed of light, something he deemed impossible. But, numerous experiments have shown that entanglement does indeed exist.
The challenge was putting it to use. A few experiments in the lab had previously managed to send information using quantum entanglement. But translating their efforts to the real world, where any number of factors could confound the process is a much more difficult challenge.
That’s exactly what these two teams of researchers have done. Their breakthrough, published in two separate papers today in Nature Photonics, promises to offer important advancements for communications and encryption technologies. Both experiments encode a message into a photon and send it to a way station of sorts.
There, the message is transferred to a different photon, which is entangled with a photon held by the receiver. This destroys the information held in the first photon, but transmits the information via entanglement to the receiver. When the way station measures the photon, it creates kind of key — a decoder ring of sorts — that can decrypt the entangled photon’s information. That key is then sent over an internet connection, where it is combined with the information contained within the entangled photon to reveal the message.
The two experiments weren't able to transmit very much information — the Calgary experiment was the quickest, and they only managed 17 photons a minute. The Hefei experiment was able to guess the state of the photons with better accuracy, however. While the Calgary researchers succeeded about 25 percent of the time, the Hefei researchers were right at most 50 percent of the time, due to their inclusion of an extra, albeit time-consuming, step in the process.
Because both methods possess their own advantages, they will likely each form the basis for further research. Nevertheless, both teams were able to use existing telecommunications infrastructure to accomplish something that had only been done in the lab before — a big step forward. The Calgary team sent photons over a distance of about 4 miles, while the Hefei team spanned almost 9.
Beam Me Up Scotty?
This isn't teleportation in the ""Star Trek"" sense — the photons aren't disappearing from one place and appearing in another. Instead, it's the information that's being teleported through quantum entanglement. The teleportation moniker is used because the initial message sent is destroyed when the photon carrying it gets measured, and it is only the information that gets teleported from one place to another.
One of the largest hurdles for both teams to overcome was the tendency of fiber optic cables to stretch and compress due to temperature changes. While this doesn't matter for regular telecommunications, for quantum communication, the photons that are sent must arrive at precisely the same time. Both teams of researchers used additional complex data inputs to ensure that their photons were arriving exactly the same as they started out.
Quantum teleportation over long distances has actually been accomplished before — in 2012, a team of researchers from Austria sent information almost 90 miles between two of the Canary Islands using lasers. Using lasers to send information can work in some situations, but adverse environmental conditions can disrupt the signal. This is why the internet today consists of a network of fiber optic cables instead.
Quantum teleportation’s biggest application will likely be as a means of encrypting information. Because the two photons communicate with each other by entanglement, there's no way for an outsider to read them. To decrypt a message, you would need the key, which is sent over the internet. Even if you intercepted the key, you would still only have half of the puzzle — to fully read it, you would need the entangled photons themselves.

A team of scientists at USC has verified that quantum effects are indeed at play in the first commercial quantum optimization processor. The team demonstrated that the D-Wave processor housed at the USC-Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center behaves in a manner that indicates that quantum mechanics plays a functional role in the way it works. The demonstration involved a small subset of the chip's 128 qubits.
This means that the device appears to be operating as a quantum processor -- something that scientists had hoped for but have needed extensive testing to verify.
The quantum processor was purchased from Canadian manufacturer D-Wave nearly two years ago by Lockheed Martin and housed at the USC Viterbi Information Sciences Institute (ISI). As the first of its kind, the task for scientists putting it through its paces was to determine whether the quantum computer was operating as hoped.
""Using a specific test problem involving eight qubits we have verified that the D-Wave processor performs optimization calculations (that is, finds lowest energy solutions) using a procedure that is consistent with quantum annealing and is inconsistent with the predictions of classical annealing,"" said Daniel Lidar, scientific director of the Quantum Computing Center and one of the researchers on the team, who holds joint appointments with the USC Viterbi School of Engineering and the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
Quantum annealing is a method of solving optimization problems using quantum mechanics -- at a large enough scale, potentially much faster than a traditional processor can.
Research institutions throughout the world build and use quantum processors, but most only have a few quantum bits, or ""qubits.""
Qubits have the capability of encoding the two digits of one and zero at the same time -- as opposed to traditional bits, which can encode distinctly either a one or a zero. This property, called ""superposition,"" along with the ability of quantum states to ""tunnel"" through energy barriers, are hoped to play a role in helping future generations of the D-Wave processor to ultimately perform optimization calculations much faster than traditional processors.
With 108 functional qubits, the D-Wave processor at USC inspired hopes for a significant advance in the field of quantum computing when it was installed in October 2011 -- provided it worked as a quantum information processor. Quantum processors can fall victim to a phenomenon called ""decoherence,"" which stifles their ability to behave in a quantum fashion.
The USC team's research shows that the chip, in fact, performed largely as hoped, demonstrating the potential for quantum optimization on a larger-than-ever scale.
""Our work seems to show that, from a purely physical point of view, quantum effects play a functional role in information processing in the D-Wave processor,"" said Sergio Boixo, first author of the research paper, who conducted the research while he was a computer scientist at ISI and research assistant professor at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
Boixo and Lidar collaborated with Tameem Albash, postdoctoral research associate in physics at USC Dornsife; Federico M. Spedalieri, computer scientist at ISI; and Nicholas Chancellor, a recent physics graduate at USC Dornsife. Their findings will be published in Nature Communications on June 28.
The news comes just two months after the Quantum Computing Center's original D-Wave processor -- known commercially as the ""Rainier"" chip -- was upgraded to a new 512-qubit ""Vesuvius"" chip. The Quantum Computing Center, which includes a magnetically shielded box that is kept frigid (near absolute zero) to protect the computer against decoherence, was designed to be upgradable to keep up with the latest developments in the field.
The new Vesuvius chip at USC is currently the only one in operation outside of D-Wave. A second such chip, owned by Google and housed at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, is expected to become operational later this year.
Next, the USC team will take the Vesuvius chip for a test drive, putting it through the same paces as the Rainier chip.";4219;['castvs0', 'casuwph', 'casvnm6', 'casxb2l', 'casze04', 'caszqa2', 'caszzec', 'cat0lwu', 'cat118p', 'cat1e8n', 'cat1xjo', 'cat1ynq', 'cat26la', 'cat29g2', 'cat2oj2', 'cat2ov2', 'cat2ui1', 'cat31uc', 'cat33lx', 'cat35tt', 'cat3auj', 'cat3jpc', 'cat3ml9', 'cat3pp8', 'cat3pu1', 'cat3rxp', 'cat3xkp', 'cat4f1l', 'cat4hvk', 'cat4jqe', 'cat4mo7', 'cat4pcg', 'cat4v1s', 'cat529i', 'cat596a', 'cat5bil', 'cat5ljo', 'cat5y2x', 'cat7x14', 'cat9po5'];43;1;[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.25, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0];0.35;0.496875;0.4602988159880492;0.28843259069494903;14.0;19.875

This network was built with off-the-shelf equipment, which would be compatible with existing internet infrastructure.
Qubits work by replacing traditional bits – the ‘1’s’ and ‘0’s’ used to encode digital information – with quantum bits, or qubits.
These are able to function as both a ‘1’ and a ‘0’ at the same time by existing in a state of superposition, meaning each new qubit added to the computer increases is power exponentially rather than linearly.
Quantum teleportation, therefore, is a transfer of quantum states from one location to the other. This transfer was done using quantum entanglement, where two particles are linked in such a way that information shared with one is shared with the other at exactly the same time.
This is because the particles exist in states of probabilities, where their exact position, momentum, and spin is not determined until the particle has been measured.
Photons behave in this way, becoming a wave or a particle depending on how they are measured.
“We wanted to push the envelope for this type of research and take important steps on a path to realise both real-life applications for quantum communications and networks and test fundamental physics ideas,” Panagiotis Spentzouris, head of the Quantum Science Program at Fermilab, told Motherboard.
“People on social media are asking if they should sign up for a quantum internet provider (jokingly of course),” Maria Spiropulu, Shang-Yi Ch’en professor of physics at Caltech, said. “We need (a lot) more R&D work.”
Quantum computers are capable of performing computations nearly 100 trillion times faster than the world’s most powerful supercomputer. Teams from the University of Science and Technology of China, as well as Google, have managed to achieve such feats using two different methods.
The US Department of Energy recently unveiled a blueprint for national quantum internet in Chicago, and the demonstration achieved by the scientists could “lay the foundation for the construction of a Chicago-area metropolitan quantum network,” Spentzouris said.

First step to a quantum internet.'];[nan];2014-04-22;Peter Reuell;Flipping the switch;"Harvard researchers have succeeded in creating quantum switches that can be turned on and off using a single photon, a technological achievement that could pave the way for creating highly secure quantum networks.
Built from single atoms, the first-of-their-kind switches could one day be networked via fiber-optic cables to form the backbone of a “quantum Internet” that allows for perfectly secure communications, said Professor of Physics Mikhail Lukin, who, together with Professor Vladan Vuletic of MIT, led a team consisting of graduate students Jeff Thompson and Lee Liu and postdoctoral fellows Tobias Tiecke and Nathalie de Leon to construct the new system. Their research is detailed in a recently published paper in the journal Nature.
“From a technical standpoint, it’s a remarkable accomplishment,” Lukin said of the advance. “Conceptually, the idea is very simple: Push the conventional light switch to its ultimate limit. What we’ve done here is to use a single atom as a switch that, depending on its state, can open or close the flow of photons … and it can be turned on and off using a single photon.”
Though the switches could be used to build a quantum computer, Lukin said it’s unlikely the technology will show up in the average desktop computer.
Where it will be used, he said, is in creating fiber-optical networks that use quantum cryptography, a method for encrypting communications using the laws of quantum mechanics to allow for perfectly secure information exchanges. Such systems make it impossible to intercept and read messages sent over a network, because the very act of measuring a quantum object changes it, leaving behind telltale signs of the spying.
“It’s unlikely everyone would need this type of technology,” he said. “But there are some realistic applications that could someday have transformative impact on our society. At present, we are limited to using quantum cryptography over relatively short distances — tens of kilometers. Based on the new advance, we may eventually be able to extend the range of quantum cryptography to thousands of kilometers.”
Importantly, Tiecke said, their system is highly scalable, and could one day allow for the fabrication of thousands of such switches in a single device.
“What we’ve really done is take ideas that people have been exploring, and still are exploring, in macroscopic systems where the light bounces back and forth on two centimeter-size mirrors to interact with an atom. We’ve taken that and shrunk it down,” said Thompson. “For two decades, researchers have been working on coupling two or three of these macroscopic systems and [creating] a simple network. But it’s very easy for us to create three or four, or 10,000 of these optical circuits. What the present paper shows is, at least technologically, the way forward.”
That is one way, Lukin believes, for quantum systems to make the same transition that conventional computers made decades ago.
“Conventional computers were initially built using vacuum tubes, and people eventually developed integrated circuits used in modern computers,” he said. “Where quantum systems stand today, the best systems are still analogous to vacuum tubes. They typically use vacuum chambers to isolate and hold single atoms using electromagnetic fields.
“But it’s very clear, if we want to scale these systems up, we have to think about using integrated circuits,” he continued. “What Jeff and Tobias have done is create a hybrid system. We take atoms in vacuum chambers and combine them with integrated circuits.”
Though fabricated in a way similar to how traditional computer chips are made, the integrated circuits built by Thompson and Tiecke don’t run on electricity, but on light.
The chips use nanophotonic technology — essentially the ability to create “wiring” that can channel and control the pathway of light — to build optical circuits that can then be connected to fiber optic cables.
After placing the optical circuits in a vacuum chamber, researchers used “optical tweezers” — precisely focused lasers — to capture a single atom and cool it to a fraction above absolute zero. They then move the atom to within a few hundred nanometers of the chip.
Simply bringing the two parts together, however, isn’t enough. To create quantum switches that one day may be at the heart of quantum networks, the researchers bombard the atom with microwaves and lasers, causing it to enter a quantum superposition state, meaning it can occupy multiple quantum states, corresponding to on and off states of the switch, at once.
“For this to work, the atom switch must be prepared in this special superposition state,” Lukin explained. “This superposition state is extremely fragile — so fragile that when a single photon hits it, it actually changes its phase. That change of phase is what allows it to act like a valve, and be turned on or off.”
While it’s unlikely the switches will become standard equipment for personal computers, Lukin said, they could appear in prototype quantum networks in as little as a decade.
“There are other systems that are more sophisticated in terms of building a quantum computer,” Thompson said. “But the key advantage to what’s demonstrated in this paper is the single-atom switch is very tightly coupled to light, and specifically to light in optical fibers.”";5329;['cha0cxh', 'cha0fk7', 'cha2gju', 'cha3ffw', 'cha55s2', 'cha6sfv', 'cha6tm1', 'cha8ki7', 'cha8ou4', 'cha8w6h', 'cha92f9', 'cha94hu', 'cha94sx', 'cha9qoa', 'cha9ret', 'cha9ygt', 'chaahuw', 'chabr7f', 'chac3nf', 'chacm50', 'chad0nl', 'chad145', 'chadxa4', 'chae1f6', 'chaefiu', 'chaenxc', 'chafbgs', 'chafsq5', 'chahc3z', 'chahrey', 'chahuy8', 'chaia72', 'chak1zq', 'chaljcf', 'chany2h', 'chatcj7', 'chathm1', 'chatj0q', 'chbgc9g', 'chdgh7n'];44;1;[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];[0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.625, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.875, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5];0.54375;0.55625;0.467331186098253;0.3198510395480996;21.75;22.25

The system marks a major step toward building large-scale quantum machines that could be used to shed light on a host of complex quantum processes and eventually help bring about real-world breakthroughs in material science, communication technologies, finance, and many other fields, overcoming research hurdles that are beyond the capabilities of even the fastest supercomputers today. Qubits are the fundamental building blocks on which quantum computers run and the source of their massive processing power.
“This moves the field into a new domain where no one has ever been to thus far,” said Mikhail Lukin, the George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Physics, co-director of the Harvard Quantum Initiative, and one of the senior authors of the study published today in the journal Nature. “We are entering a completely new part of the quantum world.”
According to Sepehr Ebadi, a physics student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the study’s lead author, it is the combination of system’s unprecedented size and programmability that puts it at the cutting edge of the race for a quantum computer, which harnesses the mysterious properties of matter at extremely small scales to greatly advance processing power. Under the right circumstances, the increase in qubits means the system can store and process exponentially more information than the classical bits on which standard computers run.
“The number of quantum states that are possible with only 256 qubits exceeds the number of atoms in the solar system,” Ebadi said, explaining the system’s vast size.
Already, the simulator has allowed researchers to observe several exotic quantum states of matter that had never before been realized experimentally, and to perform a quantum phase transition study so precise that it serves as the textbook example of how magnetism works at the quantum level.
These experiments provide powerful insights on the quantum physics underlying material properties and can help show scientists how to design new materials with exotic properties.
The project uses a significantly upgraded version of a platform the researchers developed in 2017, which was capable of reaching a size of 51 qubits. That older system allowed the researchers to capture ultra-cold rubidium atoms and arrange them in a specific order using a one-dimensional array of individually focused laser beams called optical tweezers.
This new system allows the atoms to be assembled in two-dimensional arrays of optical tweezers. This increases the achievable system size from 51 to 256 qubits. Using the tweezers, researchers can arrange the atoms in defect-free patterns and create programmable shapes like square, honeycomb, or triangular lattices to engineer different interactions between the qubits.
“The workhorse of this new platform is a device called the spatial light modulator, which is used to shape an optical wavefront to produce hundreds of individually focused optical tweezer beams,” said Ebadi. “These devices are essentially the same as what is used inside a computer projector to display images on a screen, but we have adapted them to be a critical component of our quantum simulator.”
The initial loading of the atoms into the optical tweezers is random, and the researchers must move the atoms around to arrange them into their target geometries. The researchers use a second set of moving optical tweezers to drag the atoms to their desired locations, eliminating the initial randomness. Lasers give the researchers complete control over the positioning of the atomic qubits and their coherent quantum manipulation.";3850;['h4kv4b2', 'h4kzdeo', 'h4l6v4n', 'h4l7gjg', 'h4l7s0u', 'h4l7yhw', 'h4l9edp', 'h4l9jpn', 'h4ldnei', 'h4led1z', 'h4lf7h0', 'h4lfga6', 'h4lh2um', 'h4li7gz', 'h4lilo1', 'h4lji1c', 'h4lmly1', 'h4lnjdq', 'h4ls5rt', 'h4lv6i0', 'h4m8dqb', 'h4m90kk', 'h4ma7l7', 'h4mccsm', 'h4mll9d', 'h4nawrp', 'h4nci88', 'h4nf171', 'h4nmh1l', 'h4nocb8', 'h4ntisk', 'h4nxd7x', 'h4nyovf', 'h4o19jl', 'h4o2kw3', 'h4o2xyt', 'h4obcst', 'h4otxu0', 'h4pxy3m', 'h4qmlf6'];43;1;[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.0, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.875, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0];0.36875;0.434375;0.4401260472864563;0.20153221671732785;14.75;17.375

A team of physicists at the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics and Astronomy has used mathematical calculations to show that quantum communications across interstellar space should be possible. In their paper published in the journal Physical Review D, the group describes their calculations and also the possibility of extraterrestrial beings attempting to communicate with us using such signaling.
Over the past several years, scientists have been investigating the possibility of using quantum communications as a highly secure form of message transmission. Prior research has shown that it would be nearly impossible to intercept such messages without detection. In this new effort, the researchers wondered if similar types of communications might be possible across interstellar space. To find out, they used math that describes that movement of X-rays across a medium, such as those that travel between the stars. More specifically, they looked to see if their calculations could show the degree of decoherence that might occur during such a journey.
With quantum communications, engineers are faced with quantum particles that lose some or all of their unique characteristics as they interact with obstructions in their path—they have been found to be quite delicate, in fact. Such events are known as decoherence, and engineers working to build quantum networks have been devising ways to overcome the problem. Prior research has shown that the space between the stars is pretty clean. But is it clean enough for quantum communications? The math shows that it is. Space is so clean, in fact, that X-ray photons could travel hundreds of thousands of light years without becoming subject to decoherence—and that includes gravitational interference from astrophysical bodies. They noted in their work that optical and microwave bands would work equally well.
The researchers noted that because quantum communication is possible across the galaxy, if other intelligent beings exist in the Milky Way, they could already be trying to communicate with us using such technology and we could begin looking for them. They also suggest that quantum teleportation across interstellar space should be possible.";2318;['if4bktq', 'if4sci2', 'if4t3n4', 'if52o7u', 'if57quw', 'if595tv', 'if5a0fa', 'if5byg1', 'if5byup', 'if5doxj', 'if5f1y5', 'if5gl2q', 'if5k4wy', 'if5rqhp', 'if62yyg', 'if69qhv', 'if6cf69', 'if6cm6b', 'if6gauf', 'if6ius6', 'if6lg7s', 'if6s41p', 'if6t14y', 'if6zvox', 'if70gog', 'if70z0e', 'if74ioz', 'if76efp', 'if77ijs', 'if7dbic', 'if7joh6', 'if7ljz2', 'if7m9xc', 'if89xjm', 'if8c100', 'if8e85q', 'if8jt22', 'if8pj4m', 'if9gmnp', 'igh1wbz'];43;1;[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0];[0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.125, 0.5, 1.0, 0.875, 0.125, 0.375, 0.375, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.875, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.25];0.34375;0.54375;0.4461204293685731;0.28442650632456884;13.75;21.75

John Martinis used the arm of his reading glasses to indicate the spot where he intends to demonstrate an almost unimaginably powerful new form of computer in a few years. It is a cylindrical socket an inch and a half across, at the bottom of a torso-sized stack of plates, blocks, and wires of brass, copper, and gold. The day after I met with him this fall, he loaded the socket with an experimental superconducting chip etched with a microscopic Google logo and cooled the apparatus to a hundredth of a degree Celsius above absolute zero. To celebrate that first day of testing the machine, Martinis threw what he called “a little party” at a brewpub with colleagues from his newly outfitted Google lab in Santa Barbara, California.
John Martinis has been researching how quantum computers could work for 30 years. Now he could be on the verge of finally making a useful one.
That party was nothing compared with the celebration that will take place if Martinis and his group can actually create the wonder computer they seek. Because it would harness the strange properties of quantum physics that arise in extreme conditions like those on the ultracold chip, the new computer would let a Google coder run calculations in a coffee break that would take a supercomputer of today millions of years. The software that Google has developed on ordinary computers to drive cars or answer questions could become vastly more intelligent. And earlier-stage ideas bubbling up at Google and its parent company, such as robots that can serve as emergency responders or software that can converse at a human level, might become real.
The theoretical underpinnings of quantum computing are well established. And physicists can build the basic units, known as qubits, out of which a quantum computer would be made. They can even operate qubits together in small groups. But they have not made a fully working, practical quantum computer.
Martinis is a towering figure in the field: his research group at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has demonstrated some of the most reliable qubits around and gotten them running some of the code a quantum computer would need to function. He was hired by Google in June 2014 after persuading the company that his team’s technology could mature rapidly with the right support. With his new Google lab up and running, Martinis guesses that he can demonstrate a small but useful quantum computer in two or three years. “We often say to each other that we’re in the process of giving birth to the quantum computer industry,” he says.
Google and quantum computing are a match made in algorithmic heaven. The company is often said to be defined by an insatiable hunger for data. But Google has a more pressing strategic addiction: to technology that extracts information from data, and even creates intelligence from it. The company was founded to commercialize an algorithm for ranking Web pages, and it built its financial foundations with systems that sell and target ads. More recently, Google has invested heavily in the development of AI software that can learn to understand language or images, perform basic reasoning, or steer a car through traffic—all things that remain tricky for conventional computers but should be a breeze for quantum ones. “Machine learning is a core, transformative way by which we’re rethinking how we’re doing everything,” Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, recently informed investors. Supporting that effort would be the first of many jobs for Martinis’s new quantum industry.
Dream maker
As recently as last week the prospect of a quantum computer doing anything useful within a few years seemed remote. Researchers in government, academic, and corporate labs were far from combining enough qubits to make even a simple proof-of-principle machine. A well-funded Canadian startup called D-Wave Systems sold a few of what it called “the world’s first commercial quantum computers” but spent years failing to convince experts that the machines actually were doing what a quantum computer should (see “The CIA and Jeff Bezos Bet on Quantum Computing”).
Then NASA summoned journalists to building N-258 at its Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, which since 2013 has hosted a D-Wave computer bought by Google. There Hartmut Neven, who leads the Quantum Artificial Intelligence lab Google established to experiment with the D-Wave machine, unveiled the first real evidence that it can offer the power proponents of quantum computing have promised. In a carefully designed test, the superconducting chip inside D-Wave’s computer—known as a quantum annealer—had performed 100 million times faster than a conventional processor.
 As recently as last week the prospect of a quantum computer doing anything useful within a few years seemed remote. Then NASA summoned journalists to its Ames Research Center in Mountain View.
However, this kind of advantage needs to be available in practical computing tasks, not just contrived tests. “We need to make it easier to take a problem that comes up at an engineer’s desk and put it into the computer,” said Neven, a talkative machine-learning expert. That’s where Martinis comes in. Neven doesn’t think D-Wave can get a version of its quantum annealer ready to serve Google’s engineers quickly enough, so he hired Martinis to do it. “It became clear that we can’t just wait,” Neven says. “There’s a list of shortcomings that need to be overcome in order to arrive at a real technology.” He says the qubits on D-Wave’s chip are too unreliable and aren’t wired together thickly enough. (D-Wave’s CEO, Vern Brownell, responds that he’s not worried about competition from Google.)
Google will be competing not only with whatever improvements D-Wave can make, but also with Microsoft and IBM, which have substantial quantum computing projects of their own (see “Microsoft’s Quantum Mechanics” and “IBM Shows Off a Quantum Computing Chip”). But those companies are focused on designs much further from becoming practically useful. Indeed, a rough internal time line for Google’s project estimates that Martinis’s group can make a quantum annealer with 100 qubits as soon as 2017. D-Wave’s latest chip already has 1,097 qubits, but Neven says a high-quality chip with fewer qubits will probably be useful for some tasks nonetheless. A quantum annealer can run only one particular algorithm, but it happens to be one well suited to the areas Google most cares about. The applications that could particularly benefit include pattern recognition and machine learning, says William Oliver, a senior staff member at MIT Lincoln Laboratory who has studied the potential of quantum computing.
John Martinis, 57, is the perfect person to wrestle a mind-bogglingly complex strand of quantum physics research into a new engineering discipline. Not only can he dive into the esoteric math, but he loves to build things. Operating even a single qubit is a puzzle assembled from deep quantum theory, solid-state physics, materials science, microfabrication, mechanical design, and conventional electronics. Martinis, who is tall with a loud, friendly voice, makes a point of personally mastering the theory and technical implementation of every piece. Giving a tour of his new lab at Google, he is as excited about the new soldering irons and machine tools in the conventional workshop area as he is about the more sophisticated equipment that chills chips and operates them. “To me it’s fun,” he says. “I’ve been able to do experiments no one else could do, because I could build my own electronics.”
Martinis and his team have to be adept at so many things because qubits are fickle. They can be made in various ways—Martinis uses aluminum loops chilled with tiny currents until they become superconductors—but all represent data by means of delicate quantum states that are easily distorted or destroyed by heat and electromagnetic noise, potentially ruining a calculation.
Qubits use their fragile physics to do the same thing that transistors use electricity to do on a conventional chip: represent binary bits of information, either 0 or 1. But qubits can also attain a state, called a superposition, that is effectively both 0 and 1 at the same time. Qubits in a superposition can become linked by a phenomenon known as entanglement, which means an action performed on one has instant effects on the other. Those effects allow a single operation in a quantum computer to do the work of many, many more operations in a conventional computer. In some cases, a quantum computer’s advantage over a conventional one should grow exponentially with the amount of data to be worked on.
The difficulty of creating qubits that are stable enough is the reason we don’t have quantum computers yet. But Martinis has been working on that for more than 11 years and thinks he’s nearly there. The coherence time of his qubits, or the length of time they can maintain a superposition, is tens of microseconds—about 10,000 times the figure for those on D-Wave’s chip.
Martinis’s confidence in his team’s hardware even has him thinking he can build Google an alternative to a quantum annealer that would be even more powerful. A universal quantum computer, as it would be called, could be programmed to take on any kind of problem, not just one kind of math. The theory behind that approach is actually better understood than the one for annealers, in part because most of the time and money in quantum computing research have been devoted to universal quantum computing. But qubits have not been reliable enough to translate the theory into a working universal quantum computer.
Until March, that is, when Martinis and his team became the first to demonstrate qubits that crossed a crucial reliability threshold for a universal quantum computer (see “Google Researchers Make Quantum Computing Components More Reliable”). They got a chip with nine qubits to run part of an error-checking program, called the surface code, that’s necessary for such a computer to operate (IBM has since gotten part of the surface code working on four qubits). “We demonstrated the technology to a point where I knew we could scale up,” says Martinis. “This was for real.”
Martinis aims to show off a complete universal quantum computer with about 100 qubits around the same time he delivers Google’s new quantum annealer, in about two years. That would be a milestone in computer science, but it would be unlikely to help Google’s programmers right away. Such is the complexity of the surface code that although a chip with 100 qubits could run the error-checking program, it would be unable to do any useful work in addition to that, says Robert McDermott, who leads a quantum computing research group at the University of Wisconsin. Yet Martinis thinks that once he can get his qubits reliable enough to put 100 of them on a universal quantum chip, the path to combining many more will open up. “This is something we understand pretty well,” he says. “It’s hard to get coherence but easy to scale up.”
Stupid algorithms
When Martinis explains why his technology is needed at Google, he doesn’t spare the feelings of the people working on AI. “Machine-learning algorithms are really kind of stupid,” he says, with a hint of wonder in his voice. “They need so many examples to learn.”
Indeed, the machine learning used by Google and other computing companies is pathetic next to the way humans or animals pick up new skills or knowledge. Teaching a piece of software new tricks, such as how to recognize cars and cats in photos, generally requires thousands or millions of carefully curated and labeled examples. Although a technique called deep learning has recently produced striking advances in the accuracy with which software can learn to interpret images and speech, more complex faculties like understanding the nuances of language remain out of machines’ reach.
Figuring out how Martinis’s chips can make Google’s software less stupid falls to Neven. He thinks that the prodigious power of qubits will narrow the gap between machine learning and biological learning—and remake the field of artificial intelligence. “Machine learning will be transformed into quantum learning,” he says. That could mean software that can learn from messier data, or from less data, or even without explicit instruction. For instance, Google’s researchers have designed an algorithm they think could allow machine-learning software to pick up a new trick even if as much as half the example data it’s given is incorrectly labeled. Neven muses that this kind of computational muscle could be the key to giving computers capabilities today limited to humans. “People talk about whether we can make creative machines–the most creative systems we can build will be quantum AI systems,” he says.
More practically, with only D-Wave’s machine to practice on for now, Google’s researchers can’t do much more than speculate about what exactly they could or should do with the chips Martinis is building. Even when they do get their hands on them, it will take time to invent and build the infrastructure needed to operate large numbers of the exotic devices so they can contribute materially to Google’s business.
Neven is confident that Google’s quantum craftsmen and his team can get through all that. He pictures rows of superconducting chips lined up in data centers for Google engineers to access over the Internet relatively soon. “I would predict that in 10 years there’s nothing but quantum machine learning–you don’t do the conventional way anymore,” he says. A smiling Martinis warily accepts that vision. “I like that, but it’s hard,” he says. “He can say that, but I have to build it.”";13940;['cy39gsl', 'cy3a2ic', 'cy3b4ie', 'cy3cf5y', 'cy3ds2w', 'cy3dwgw', 'cy3e3vy', 'cy3eemu', 'cy3end9', 'cy3fnj4', 'cy3ghl4', 'cy3hl7g', 'cy3hv6e', 'cy3i649', 'cy3ipr7', 'cy3iswj', 'cy3jm5c', 'cy3jsc3', 'cy3ke4y', 'cy3knfy', 'cy3lihs', 'cy3lupz', 'cy3mog2', 'cy3mt7g', 'cy3ndpf', 'cy3obr0', 'cy3ot3b', 'cy3qx0w', 'cy3rjvd', 'cy3scry', 'cy3suyr', 'cy3taf5', 'cy3z319', 'cy4051s', 'cy42vbe', 'cy44ozj', 'cy44ygu', 'cy45cdw', 'cy45t9p', 'd1lcuto'];42;1;[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0];[1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 0.375, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.125, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.375, 0.25, 0.75, 0.5, 0.625, 0.5, 1.0, 0.875, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5];0.46875;0.4625;0.49430348724240253;0.33330729064933456;18.75;18.5

Using artificial intelligence, physicists have compressed a daunting quantum problem that until now required 100,000 equations into a bite-size task of as few as four equations—all without sacrificing accuracy. The work, published in the September 23 issue of Physical Review Letters, could revolutionize how scientists investigate systems containing many interacting electrons. Moreover, if scalable to other problems, the approach could potentially aid in the design of materials with sought-after properties such as superconductivity or utility for clean energy generation.
""We start with this huge object of all these coupled-together differential equations; then we're using machine learning to turn it into something so small you can count it on your fingers,"" says study lead author Domenico Di Sante, a visiting research fellow at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ) in New York City and an assistant professor at the University of Bologna in Italy.
The formidable problem concerns how electrons behave as they move on a gridlike lattice. When two electrons occupy the same lattice site, they interact. This setup, known as the Hubbard model, is an idealization of several important classes of materials and enables scientists to learn how electron behavior gives rise to sought-after phases of matter, such as superconductivity, in which electrons flow through a material without resistance. The model also serves as a testing ground for new methods before they're unleashed on more complex quantum systems.
The Hubbard model is deceptively simple, however. For even a modest number of electrons and cutting-edge computational approaches, the problem requires serious computing power. That's because when electrons interact, their fates can become quantum mechanically entangled: Even once they're far apart on different lattice sites, the two electrons can't be treated individually, so physicists must deal with all the electrons at once rather than one at a time. With more electrons, more entanglements crop up, making the computational challenge exponentially harder.
One way of studying a quantum system is by using what's called a renormalization group. That's a mathematical apparatus physicists use to look at how the behavior of a system—such as the Hubbard model—changes when scientists modify properties such as temperature or look at the properties on different scales. Unfortunately, a renormalization group that keeps track of all possible couplings between electrons and doesn't sacrifice anything can contain tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or even millions of individual equations that need to be solved. On top of that, the equations are tricky: Each represents a pair of electrons interacting.
Di Sante and his colleagues wondered if they could use a machine learning tool known as a neural network to make the renormalization group more manageable. The neural network is like a cross between a frantic switchboard operator and survival-of-the-fittest evolution. First, the machine learning program creates connections within the full-size renormalization group. The neural network then tweaks the strengths of those connections until it finds a small set of equations that generates the same solution as the original, jumbo-size renormalization group. The program's output captured the Hubbard model's physics even with just four equations.
""It's essentially a machine that has the power to discover hidden patterns,"" Di Sante says. ""When we saw the result, we said, 'Wow, this is more than what we expected.' We were really able to capture the relevant physics.""
Training the machine learning program required a lot of computational muscle, and the program ran for entire weeks. The good news, Di Sante says, is that now that they have their program coached, they can adapt it to work on other problems without having to start from scratch. He and his collaborators are also investigating just what the machine learning is actually ""learning"" about the system, which could provide additional insights that might otherwise be hard for physicists to decipher.
Ultimately, the biggest open question is how well the new approach works on more complex quantum systems such as materials in which electrons interact at long distances. In addition, there are exciting possibilities for using the technique in other fields that deal with renormalization groups, Di Sante says, such as cosmology and neuroscience.";4577;['iq1bb3z', 'iq1q49q', 'iq1r344', 'iq1tru5', 'iq206lj', 'iq21vg6', 'iq21xi1', 'iq248zi', 'iq26bcg', 'iq2929h', 'iq2a6sg', 'iq2av2i', 'iq2c1x0', 'iq2dt42', 'iq2f044', 'iq2fa8i', 'iq2fttn', 'iq2fyh9', 'iq2gsdy', 'iq2k4ar', 'iq2pp0e', 'iq2stfg', 'iq2v3t4', 'iq32lv9', 'iq39r84', 'iq3bq6c', 'iq3d6a8', 'iq3dojt', 'iq3l72l', 'iq3lbbz', 'iq3n2lo', 'iq3ozfh', 'iq448aw', 'iq44i94', 'iq4gtqq', 'iq4w87c', 'iq5gg6h', 'iq6f6ed', 'iq6hq39', 'iree6vj'];40;1;[0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0];[0.375, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.875, 0.5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.625, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.625, 1.0];0.375;0.53125;0.44017042154147523;0.2791588929265912;15.0;21.25

Russian scientists from University of Science and Technology MISIS and Bauman Moscow State Technical University were one of the first in the world to implement a two-qubit operation using superconducting fluxonium qubits. Fluxoniums have a longer life cycle and a greater precision of operations, so they are used to make longer algorithms. An article on research that brings the creation of a quantum computer closer to reality has been published in npj Quantum Information.
One of the main questions in the development of a universal quantum computer is about qubits. Namely, which quantum objects are the best to make processors for quantum computers: electrons, photons, ions, superconductors, or other ""quantum transistors."" Superconducting qubits have become one of the most successful platforms for quantum computing during the past decade. To date, the most commercially successful superconducting qubits are transmons, which are actively investigated and used in the quantum developments of Google, IBM and other world leading laboratories.
The main task of a qubit is to store and process information without errors. Accidental noise and even mere observation can lead to the loss or alteration of data. The stable operation of superconducting qubits often requires extremely low ambient temperatures—close to zero Kelvin, which is hundreds of times colder than the temperature of open space.
Russian physicists from the Superconducting Metamaterials laboratory at MISIS University and Bauman Moscow State Technical University were one of the first in the world to implement a two-qubit operation using superconducting fluxonium qubits. To protect qubits from noise, the researchers added to the circuit a superinductor (a superconducting element with a high level of resistance to alternating current) which is a chain of 40 Josephson contacts—structures of two superconductors separated by a thin layer of dielectric.
""Fluxonium qubits are more complex and less studied than transmons. The main advantage of fluxoniums is that they can be operated at a low frequency of about 600 MHz. We know that the lower the frequency, the longer the lifetime of qubits, which means that more operations can be performed with them. During the tests, it turned out that the dielectric losses of fluxonium qubits allow to keep the state of the superposition longer than that of transmons,"" said Ilya Besedin, one of the authors of the study, an engineer of the scientific project at the NUST MISIS Superconducting Metamaterials laboratory.
To implement a universal set of logical operations, scientists used high-precision two-qubit gates: fSim and CZ. In order to bring the qubits into resonance with each other, parametric modulation of the flow of one of the qubits of the system was used. The authors of the study note, that due to the tunable coupling element, it was simultaneously possible not only to obtain the accuracy of two-qubit operations above 99.22%, but also to suppress the residual ZZ interaction between the qubits, which allowed to perform parallel single-qubit operations with an accuracy of 99.97%.
""The low frequency of computational qubits opens the way not only to longer qubits' lifetimes and accuracy of valve operations, which will lead to making longer algorithms, but also makes it possible to use subgigahertz electronics in qubit control lines, which significantly reduces the complexity of the quantum processor control system,"" said Ilya Besedin.
The obtained results reveal an interesting and promising approach toward fault-tolerant quantum computing with low-frequency qubits that can be a good alternative to the transmon system.
In the future, scientists plan to continue research with computations based on fluxonium qubits, optimizing the qubit control system, improving readout rates and beginning to develop multi-qubit systems based on them.";3948;['ixgxeve', 'ixhf838', 'ixhfnzs', 'ixhg9bs', 'ixhkwgs', 'ixhlju6', 'ixhlt1l', 'ixhmvgu', 'ixhuzgo', 'ixhwkxl', 'ixhyqyb', 'ixi295k', 'ixi89ha', 'ixid4vl', 'ixiep1k', 'ixiiz2e', 'ixiiz9c', 'ixiksgu', 'ixiotn8', 'ixisibm', 'ixismuw', 'ixiuuk5', 'ixiyqo9', 'ixj36fb', 'ixj69rt', 'ixj7ib3', 'ixj8dxv', 'ixjg1uh', 'ixjon96', 'ixjqk2s', 'ixk07fi', 'ixk3jon', 'ixkbwp4', 'ixkdlmm', 'ixkekto', 'ixki31m', 'ixki862', 'ixl41d1', 'ixnuhlm', 'ixouykc'];41;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.625, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.375, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.1125;0.465625;0.28476964374736297;0.2651466280664342;4.5;18.625

Physicists have exploited the laws of quantum mechanics to generate random numbers on a Nokia N9 smartphone, a breakthrough that could have major implications for information security
One of the hidden foundations of modern life are random numbers. If you make credit card payments over the internet, for example, you’re a serial user of random numbers which are necessary to guarantee the security of your personal details.
And with the advent of techniques such as quantum cryptography, which guarantees perfect secrecy and requires vast quantities of random numbers, the demand for these mathematical objects is set to increase dramatically.
But there’s a problem—genuine random numbers are notoriously hard to find. In particular, they cannot be generated by a deterministic process such as a computer program. That’s because a deterministic process can easily be repeated to reproduce the number, proving that it cannot be random.
So physicists have long searched for other ways to make genuinely random numbers based on physical processes that produce random outcomes. The gold standard is the quantum random number generator—a device that exploits the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics to produce a sequence of entirely random digits.
However, quantum random number generators are complex, expensive devices. So physicists would dearly love to find a cheaper and easier way to generate quantum random numbers.
And now they’ve found it. Today, Bruno Sanguinetti and pals at the University of Geneva in Switzerland have worked out how to generate random numbers on an ordinary smartphone using genuine quantum processes. And they say their new technique can produce random numbers at the rate of 1 megabit per second, more than enough for most security applications.
The quantum process that these guys exploit is the way light sources emit photons. Because each emission is a quantum process, the instant of emission cannot be predicted. So the number of photons that a light source emits in a unit of time will always vary by an amount that is entirely random.
This is the basis of the new technique. Sanguinetti and co point out that smartphone cameras have improved so much in recent years that they are capable of detecting the quantum variations in the number of photons they detect.
They put this to the test with a Nokia N9 smartphone, which has an ordinary 8 megapixel rear-facing colour camera (and is the only phone to run Nokia’s short-lived Meego operating system). And they compared its performance against a monochrome CCD array designed for astronomical use—an ATIK 383L which also has 8 megapixels.
The set up is simple in principle. Each pixel senses the number of photons that arrive in a certain period of time. These photons are converted into electrons, which are then amplified by a factor determined by the camera’s sensitivity setting (ISO setting).
It’s straightforward to calculate the average number of electrons this process should produce, given the probabilistic nature of photon emission. But the actual number of electrons should differ by a number that is random. That produces a single random digit. And since a light-sensitive array consists of many pixels working in parallel, it is possible to generate a large quantity of random digits from each image.
In practice, the first step is to characterise the light sensitivity of the camera by shining a green LED at it. That allows the team to work out the number of photons that saturate a pixel and ensure this does not happen while the random numbers are being generated (otherwise the results are no longer random).
Sanguinetti and co determined that they should illuminate each pixel in the Nokia camera with enough light to generate about 410 electrons and each pixel in the ATIK camera with enough light to generate about 15,000 electrons, quantities that are easily controlled by limiting the exposure time for each image.
So the process of generating random numbers consists of pointing the camera at a green LED that evenly illuminates all the pixels and pressing the shutter button. A simple program then extracts the random digits.
An important question for any random number generator is whether the resulting numbers are genuinely random. This is a notoriously difficult problem because it is impossible to prove beyond doubt that any given number really is random.
But Sanguinetti and co calculate that their numbers are pretty close to random. They say that the process would have to be repeated 10^118 times before any deviation from randomness might be observed. “If everybody on earth used such a device constantly at 1Gbps, it would take 10^80 times the age of the universe for one to notice a deviation from a perfectly random bit string,” they say.
That’s not bad. There are also various standard tests that mathematicians have devised that look for specific weaknesses in random numbers. Sanguinetti and co put their device through a number of these. “The random number generator passed all tests,” they say.
That’s an exciting result. It means that with the appropriate app, anybody with a standard smartphone can generate an almost unlimited quantity of random digits. “We believe that the
simplicity and performance of this device will make the widespread use of quantum random numbers a reality,” say Sanguinetti and co.
The security implications of this are important. In cryptography, there is a well known idea called Kerckhoffs’s principle that states that the security of a cypher should lie entirely in the key. So while every other aspect of a security system can be public, the information it carries will remain secure as long as the key is also secure.
And applications? Secure credit card transactions are only the beginning. A quantum random number generator that works at 1 Mbps can also secure emails and even phone calls.
There ought to be significant demand for this kind of service given the wholesale eavesdropping that various states have indulged in recently. So it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that some governments will want to regulate the use of this kind of technology.

The waiting time for general purpose quantum computers is getting shorter, but they are still probably decades away. The arrival of cryptanalytically-relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) that will herald the cryptopocalypse will be much sooner – possibly less than a decade. 
At that point our existing PKI-protected data will become accessible as plaintext to anybody; and the ‘harvest now, decrypt later’ process will be complete. This is known as the cryptopocalypse. It is important to note that all PKI-encrypted data that has already been harvested by adversaries is already lost. We can do nothing about the past; we can only attempt to protect the future.
Here we are going to examine the why, what, and how we need to prepare for that cryptopocalypse – but first we need a few definitions to ensure we’re all singing the same song.
 - CRQC: A quantum computer capable of running Shor’s algorithm and cracking current PKI encryption.
 - Cryptopocalypse: The point at which the existence of CRQCs are able to turn our currently encrypted data into plaintext.
 - Quantum safe: Cryptography that is believed to be resistant to CRQCs, but cannot be proven to be so.
- Quantum secure: Cryptography that is provably secure against CRQCs, and cannot be broken.
- Post quantum cryptography (PQC): A term for cryptography designed for the post CRQC era, but one that doesn’t differentiate between ‘safe’ and ‘secure’.
The cryptopocalypse
The cryptopocalypse is the point at which quantum computing becomes powerful enough to use Shor’s algorithm to crack PKI encryption. Since public key encryption is used to secure almost all data in transit, both between separate IT infrastructures and even within individual infrastructures, that data will become accessible by anyone with a sufficiently powerful quantum computer.
“That means that all secrets are at risk,” explains Bryan Ware, CEO at LookingGlass; “nuclear weapons, banks, business IP, intelligence agencies, among other things, are at risk of losing their confidentiality and integrity.”
But this is not a threat for the future – the threat exists today. Adversaries are known to be stealing and storing encrypted data with the knowledge that within a few years they will be able to access the raw data. This is known as the ‘harvest now, decrypt later’ threat. Intellectual property and commercial plans – not to mention military secrets – will still be valuable to adversaries when the cryptopocalypse happens.
“Even if a cryptographically relevant quantum computer is still years away, the time to start preparing is now,” warns Rebecca Krauthamer, co-founder and CPO at QuSecure.
The one thing we can say with certainty is that it definitely won’t happen in 2023 – probably. That probably comes from not knowing for certain what stage in the journey to quantum computing has been achieved by foreign nations or their intelligence agencies – and they’re not likely to tell us. Nevertheless, it is assumed that nobody yet has a quantum computer powerful enough to run Shor’s algorithm and crack PKI encryption in a meaningful timeframe.
It is likely that such computers may become available as soon as three to five years. Most predictions suggest ten years. Note that a specialized quantum computer designed specifically for Shor does not need to be as powerful as a general-purpose quantum computer – which is more likely to be 20 to 30 years away.
It is difficult to make precise predictions because the power of a quantum computer comes from the number of qubits that can be used. This is further complicated by the instability of qubits that require a high number of additional qubits used solely for error correction. Consequently, the number of qubits that can be ‘used’ (logical qubits) is much less than the total number needed (physical qubits).
It has been suggested that as many as 1,000 physical qubits may be required for each logical qubit. This will depend on the quality of the error correction in use – and this is an area of intense research. So, at some time in the next few years, as the number of physical qubits increases, and the number of required physical qubits per logical qubit decreases, quantum developers will have a quantum computer able to crack PKI. It has been estimated that this will require between approximately 1,000 and 2,000 logical qubits.
To put some flesh on this skeleton, we can look at an announcement made by IBM on November 9, 2022: a new 433 qubit Osprey processor. This was accompanied by a roadmap that that shows a progression toward a 4,000 plus qubit quantum computer, codenamed Kookaburra, due in 2025.
Error correction is being approached by a new version of IBM’s Qskit Runtime software that allows ‘a user to trade speed for reduced error count with a simple option in the API’. This is supported by a new modular IBM Quantum System Two able to combine multiple processors into a single system with communication links. System Two is expected to go live in 2023, around the same time that IBM expects to have a 1k+ qubit processor codenamed Condor.
System Two will be a building block in what IBM calls quantum-centric supercomputing. Scott Crowder, the VP of IBM quantum adoption and business, explains in more detail: “Quantum-centric supercomputing (which describes a modular architecture and quantum communication designed to increase computational capacity, and which employs hybrid cloud middleware to seamlessly integrate quantum and classical workflows) is the blueprint for how quantum computing will be used in the years to come.”
He added, “This approach to scaling quantum systems alongside the recent, dramatic improvements in techniques to deal with quantum processor errors is how we envision a path to near-term, practical quantum advantage – the point when quantum processors will be capable of performing a useful computation, faster, more accurately, or cheaper than using exclusively classical computing.”
Navigating such projections doesn’t tell us precisely when to expect the cryptopocalypse, but they clearly show it is getting perilously close. “Quantum computing is not, yet, to the point of rendering conventional encryption useless, at least that we know of, but it is heading that way,” comments Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber.
The additional threat from AI
Skip Sanzeri, co-founder and COO at QuSecure, warns that the threat to current encryption is not limited to quantum decryption. “New approaches are being developed promising the same post-quantum cybersecurity threats as a cryptographically relevant quantum computer, only much sooner,” he said. “It is also believed that quantum advancements don’t have to directly decrypt today’s encryption. If they weaken it by suggesting or probabilistically finding some better seeds for a classical algorithm (like the sieve) and make that more efficient, that can result in a successful attack. And it’s no stretch to predict, speaking of predictions, that people are going to find ways to hack our encryption that we don’t even know about yet.”
Steve Weston, co-founder and CTO at Incrypteon, offers a possible illustration. “Where is the threat in 2023 and beyond?” he asks. “Is it the threat from quantum computers, or is the bigger threat from AI? An analysis of cryptoanalysis and code breaking over the last 40 years shows how AI is used now, and will be more so in the future.”
QKD
Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a method of securely exchanging encryption keys using quantum properties transmitted via fiber. While in this quantum state, the nature of quantum mechanics ensures that any attempt to access the transmission will disturb the content. It does not prevent attacks, but ensures that an attempted attack is immediately visible, and the key can be discarded. Successful QKD paves the way for data to be transmitted using the latest and best symmetrical encryption. Current symmetrical algorithms are considered safe against quantum decryption. 
“Symmetric encryption, like AES-256, is theorized to be quantum aafe, but one can speculate that key sizes will soon double,” comments Silvio Pappalardo, chief revenue officer at Quintessence Labs.
“Quantum cryptography is a method of encryption that uses the principles of quantum physics in securing and transmitting data,” says Ganesh Subramanya, head of data protection CoE cybersecurity at TCS. “It creates security so strong that data coded in quantum state cannot be compromised without the sender being notified. Traditional cryptography uses technologies like SSL and TLS to secure data over the internet, but they have been vulnerable to a variety of attacks, as an attacker can change the communication between two parties (like user’s browser and the webpage / application) and make them believe they’re still communicating with each other. With quantum cryptography, such an alteration of data is not possible, thereby strengthening the security of online transactions.”
John Prisco, Toshiba partner and president/CEO of Safe Quantum, applies these principles to QKD. “Quantum key distribution contains a key security aspect that cannot be overstated,” he says, “especially if it is being utilized in tandem with the NIST post-quantum encryption standards (PQC). The gold standard in cybersecurity is considered to be defense in-depth, as this leverages two totally different technologies with diverse failure mechanisms, working for protection. With harvest now decrypt later attacks becoming more frequent, there is no delay time that is safe to defend against quantum attacks. QKD authenticated with PQC signature algorithms is the only defense that can be deployed immediately and guarantee a successful defense against harvest now, decrypt later.”
Terry Cronin, the VP at Toshiba who oversees the QKD Division, agrees with this assessment. “The use of QKD as part of a hybrid solution to quantum resistance can offer the security needed ensuring that a harvest and decrypt attack cannot succeed in accessing the data.”
The practical difficulties in introducing wide-scale fiber based QKD means that it cannot be implemented everywhere. Its immediate use will likely be limited to point-to-point communications between high value sites – such as some government agencies and between major bank offices.
Post Quantum Cryptography
NIST
NIST began a competition to select and standardize post quantum encryption algorithms in 2016. “We’re looking to replace three NIST cryptographic standards and guidelines that would be the most vulnerable to quantum computers,” said NIST mathematician Dustin Moody at the time. “They deal with encryption, key establishment and digital signatures, all of which use forms of public key cryptography.”
In July 2022, NIST announced its first four finalists. However, it emerged in August 2022 that a different finalist, the Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE) algorithm had already been broken. SIKE is designed to deliver keys securely from source to destination across an untrusted network. Researchers had demonstrated, however, the algorithm could be cracked on a single classical PC in little over an hour.
This illustrates a problem that all security professionals need to confront. Any encryption algorithm is secure only until it is cracked. Whitehat researchers will tell you if they can crack an algorithm — foreign governments will not. In effect, this means that the ‘later’ part of ‘harvest now, decrypt later’ is an optimistic view. We believe that encrypted IP being stolen today cannot yet be decrypted — but we cannot be certain.
We do, however, know that current PKI encryption will certainly be broken by quantum computers in the relatively near future. The solution from NIST is to replace current vulnerable PKI algorithms with more complex algorithms — that is to solve more powerful computing by using more powerful algorithms. 
Ultimately, we will be in the same position we are in today. We will believe our IP protected by NIST’s post quantum algorithms will be safe — but we cannot be certain. Remember that at least one proposed post-quantum algorithm has been broken on a PC. So, even if we switch to a NIST-approved post quantum encryption standard tomorrow, we cannot be certain that the harvest now decrypt later philosophy has been beaten.
One-time pads
NIST’s PQC algorithms are ‘quantum safe’, they are not ‘quantum secure’. The former is thought to be safe against quantum decryption but cannot be proven to be so (since they are mathematical in nature and susceptible to mathematical decryption). Cryptography that can be proven to be safe is known as ‘quantum secure’ — and the only way to achieve this is to remove mathematics from the equation.
The only quantum secure cryptography known is the one-time pad because it relies on information security rather than mathematical security. Technically, QKD could be described in similarly secure terms since any attempt to obtain the keys for mathematical decryption could result in the immediate destruction of the keys (preventing them from being usefully decrypted). We have already seen that QKD has problems for widespread use — but it remains an open question whether modern technology is able to deliver usable one-time pads.
Historically, OTP has been considered unworkable for the internet age because it requires keys of the same length or longer than the message being encrypted. Nevertheless, several companies have been exploring the possibilities becoming available with new technology.
Qrypt started from the basis that the quantum threat comes from the communication of encryption keys from source to destination. If you can avoid the necessity to communicate the keys, you can eliminate the threat. It consequently developed a process that allows the generation of the same quantum random numbers simultaneously at both source and destination. A quantum random number is a genuinely random number generated with quantum mechanics principles. These numbers can then be used to generate identical keys without them needing to be transmitted across the internet.
However, since the generation of the numbers can be performed and stored until use, there remains the potential to chain the process to provide genuine OTP for the keys without requiring them to be transmitted across the internet. Solutions based on this process are quantum secure.
Incrypteon, a British startup, has taken a different route by applying Shannon’s information theories to the one-time pad. The science is a bit mind-numbing but is based on Shannon’s equivocation from his Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems published in 1949. “The definition of perfect secrecy is based on statistics and probabilities,” says Incrypteon. “A ciphertext maintains perfect secrecy if the attacker’s knowledge of the contents of the message is the same both before and after the adversary inspects the ciphertext, attacking it with unlimited resources.”
Using its own patented software and ‘Perpetual Equivocation’, Incrypteon “ensures that conditional entropy never equals zero, therefore achieving Perfect Secrecy.” The result is something that is automatically quantum secure (not just quantum safe) — and is available today.
Co-founder Helder Figueira had been an electronic warfare signals officer commanding a cryptanalysis unit in the South African Army. The concepts of Shannon’s equivocation are well-understood by the military, and he has long-been concerned that the commercial market is forced to accept encryption that is, by definition, ‘insecure’ — if something cannot be proven to be secure, it must be insecure.
A third and potentially future approach to the one-time pad could evolve from current advances in tokenization – more specifically cloud-based vaultless tokenization protected by immutable servers.
Rixon, another startup, is involved in this area. Its primary purpose is to protect PII stored by organizations with a web presence – but the principles could easily be extended. Plaintext is immediately tokenized in the cloud, and no plaintext is held onsite. Nor is the plaintext held at the tokenization engine in the cloud – all that is stored is the tokenization route for each tokenized character (for the purpose of comparison, this tokenization route is equivalent to the cryptographic key, but is random for each character).
This provides the primary parallel with the OTP – the ‘key’ is the same length as the message. Currently, Rixon concentrates on tokenizing PII; but the same concept could be extended to secure high value files at rest such as intellectual property and commercial plans.
Transition to post quantum cryptography
The coming cryptopocalypse requires organizations to transition from known quantum-vulnerable encryption (such as current PKI standards) to something that is at least quantum safe if not quantum secure. This will be a long process, and in 2023 businesses will need to start planning their route in greater detail.
Most companies will start from the viewpoint that NIST post-quantum algorithms is the only way forward. We have discussed OTP developments in some depth to show that the NIST route is not the only available route – and we expect further OTP developments during 2023. 
The full transition to post quantum readiness will take many years, and will not be achieved by throwing a switch from classical to PQC. This has led to the concept of ‘crypto agility’. “It will be essential that quantum ready algorithms (QRAs) are able to coexist with existing cryptographic capabilities, in a hybrid manner, while the complete transition to quantum safe occurs,” explains Silvio Pappalardo, chief revenue officer at Quintessence Labs. 
“Crypto agility enables applications to migrate between key types and cryptographic algorithms without the need to update the application software — transitioning from homogenous towards micro-service architecture,” he said. “With encryption ciphers changing due to the threat of quantum, decreasing longevity, increasing key sizes, and the expanding requirements to protect more data, more effectively, crypto agility becomes a business enabler and defender to keep pace with constant innovations and enable greater flexibility into the future.” Such agility also allows companies to switch from one quantum safe algorithm to another if the one in use gets broken. 
For now, government agencies will have little choice but to follow NIST. On November 18, 2022, the White House issued a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies requiring that CRQC readiness begins with taking an inventory of vulnerable assets. “By May 4, 2023, and annually thereafter until 2035”, states the memo, “agencies are directed to submit a prioritized inventory of information systems and assets, excluding national security systems, that contain CRQC-vulnerable cryptographic systems to ONCD and the Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).”
On December 21, 2022, Biden signed the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act into law. “Quantum computers are under development globally with some adversarial nation states putting tens of billions of dollars into programs to create these very powerful machines that will break the encryption we use today,” comments Sanzeri. “While not here yet, quantum computers will be online in coming years, but it will take more than a few years for our federal agencies and commercial enterprises to upgrade their systems to post quantum cybersecurity.”
This Act, he continued, “requires federal agencies to migrate systems to post quantum cryptography which is resilient against attacks from quantum computers. And the Office of Management and Budget is further required to send an annual report to Congress depicting a strategy on how to assess post-quantum cryptography risks across the federal government.”
The government is clearly wedded to the NIST proposals. This may be because NIST is correct in its assertion that OTP is not realistic. NIST computer security mathematician Dustin Moody told SecurityWeek in October 2022, “The one-time pad must be generated by a source of true randomness, and not a pseudo-random process.” But there are numerous sources for the generation of genuinely random numbers using quantum mechanics.
“The one-time pad must be as long as the message which is to be encrypted,” added Moody. “If you wish to encrypt a long message, the size of the one-time pad will be much larger than key sizes of the algorithms we [NIST] selected.” This is also being challenged as a problem by both Qrypt and Incrypteon, and potentially tokenization firms like Rixon.
Nevertheless, most companies will follow the incremental process of NIST rather than the more revolutionary process of OTP, if only because of NIST’s reputation and government support. 2023 will see more companies beginning their move to CRQC readiness – but there are more options than are immediately obvious.";21191;['j87v349', 'j87v6nz', 'j87v6tu', 'j87v78e', 'j87v8ks', 'j87v96k', 'j87vahi', 'j87vged', 'j87vmdl', 'j87vomt', 'j87vsg4', 'j87vurv', 'j87vx69', 'j87w9sa', 'j87wazx', 'j87wec3', 'j87wr0a', 'j87wuqm', 'j87x0c2', 'j87x0pl', 'j87y1zj', 'j87ylxe', 'j87ylzs', 'j87ypvh', 'j87yvd6', 'j8817i2', 'j882pbe', 'j8853sw', 'j885bm6', 'j8861r9', 'j887mkf', 'j888cs9', 'j888mo6', 'j889cl3', 'j88f8t1', 'j88j1sl', 'j88lvk1', 'j88pye6', 'j89w9a7', 'j8biogi'];40;1;[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 1.0, 0.875, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.125, 0.875, 0.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5];0.26875;0.46875;0.4307968633822674;0.29679275176459413;10.75;18.75

Quantum theory is practically perfect at predicting the behaviour we observe when we perform experiments on tiny objects like atoms. But applying quantum theory at scales much larger than atoms, in particular to observers who make the measurements, raises difficult conceptual issues.
In a paper published in Nature Physics, an international team led from Griffith University in Australia has sharpened those issues into a new paradox.
“The paradox means that if quantum theory works to describe observers, scientists would have to give up one of three cherished assumptions about the world,” said Associate Professor Eric Cavalcanti, a senior theory author on the paper.
“The first assumption is that when a measurement is made, the observed outcome is a real, single event in the world. This assumption rules out, for example, the idea that the universe can split, with different outcomes being observed in different parallel universes.”
“The second assumption is that experimental settings can be freely chosen, allowing us to perform randomised trials. And the third assumption is that once such a free choice is made, its influence cannot spread out into the universe faster than light,” he said.
“Each of these fundamental assumptions seems entirely reasonable, and is widely believed. However, it is also widely believed that quantum experiments can be scaled up to larger systems, even to the level of observers. But we show that one of these widely held beliefs must be wrong! Giving up any one of them has far-reaching consequences for our understanding of the world.”
The team has established the paradox by analysing a scenario with well-separated entangled quantum particles combined with a quantum ‘observer’ – a quantum system which can be manipulated and measured from the outside, but which can itself make measurements on a quantum particle.
“Based on the three fundamental assumptions, we have mathematically determined limits on what experimental results are possible in this scenario. But quantum theory, when applied to observers, predicts results which violate these limits. In fact, we have already performed a proof-of-principle experiment using entangled photons (particles of light),” said Dr Nora Tischler, a senior experimental author. “And we found a violation just as quantum theory predicted.”
“But our ‘observer’ had a very small ‘brain’, so to speak. It has just two memory states, which are realised as two different paths for a photon. That’s why we call it a proof-of-principle experiment, not a conclusive demonstration that one of the three fundamental assumptions in our paradox must be wrong,” she said.
“For a more definitive implementation of the paradox, our dream experiment is one where the quantum observer is a human-level artificial intelligence program running on a massive quantum computer,” said Professor Howard Wiseman, the leader of the project and Director of Griffith’s Centre for Quantum Dynamics, where the theoretical and experimental teams are based.
“That would be a pretty convincing test of whether quantum theory fails for observers, or whether one of the three fundamental assumptions is false. But that’s probably decades away.”
The Centre for Quantum Dynamics laboratory in which the experiment was performed is also part of the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, an Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence.
“It has long been recognised that quantum computers will revolutionise our ability to solve hard computational problems,” Professor Wiseman said.
“What we didn’t realise until we started this research is that they may also help answer hard philosophical problems – the nature of the physical world, the mental world, and their relationship.”";3916;['g3dbuhd', 'g3dccys', 'g3ddxe4', 'g3de7an', 'g3delmw', 'g3df05k', 'g3df6pq', 'g3dfae4', 'g3dfz5a', 'g3dfzfo', 'g3dhtq4', 'g3dj831', 'g3dk0yy', 'g3dkp6p', 'g3dsppo', 'g3dvi6t', 'g3dvykb', 'g3dyzbo', 'g3e4hse', 'g3e5vqq', 'g3ee43m', 'g3eer5v', 'g3f4l52', 'g3f868z', 'g3fdvra', 'g3fhgvo', 'g3fmzma', 'g3fo41m', 'g3fo739', 'g3fr7n8', 'g3fs2rw', 'g3fwboh', 'g3fzei1', 'g3fzvq5', 'g3g0e1z', 'g3hfbpp', 'g3hm5xc', 'g3iio7q', 'g3jl345', 'g3jl3rk'];40;1;[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 1.0];[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0];0.46875;0.50625;0.45479219155565986;0.29308435219233386;18.75;20.25
