EDIT: Just went and read the actual paper, and I *definitely* don't see reverse causality here. All I see is physicists discovering a new-ish quantum phenomenon (amplification of a perturbance through ""post-selection""), and that phenomenon has given them an avenue to use weak quantum measurements to greater effect. The measurements are coupled through time, but we already knew of quantum effects that are linked through time. These measurements cannot predict the future--shame on Discover for even implying it.

This is not true - the paper has been submitted to arXiv, a non-peer-reviewed open repository for scientific works, and as such should not be treated as one would treat peer-reviewed research.

In my opinion, this article is taking a mildly interesting result from a machine which may or may not exhibit large-scale quantum entanglement, but is certainly not a universal quantum computer, and blowing it out of proportion by comparing its performance to that of a single-core classical computer for an algorithm that is known to respond well to parallelism.";0;3w0irg;[]

[Here is an earlier presentation](, (the one I saw was more current, in that linked presentation he compares against a GPU system, (similar compute topology to large-core-count Intel sever CPU's) instead).
The D-Wave computer solves ONE and only ONE type of problem topology: the [Ising Spin Glass Problem]( Dr. Troyer analyzed the computer statistically against 3 topolgies:
- Simulated Quantum Annealing
- Simulated Classical Annealing
- One other that I can't remember (don't have notes with me).
The D-Wave system correlated HIGHLY against the simulated quantum annealing and quite low with the other two topologies. In my opinion, this is sufficient evidence, for now, to establish its credibility as a legitimately new system, and to validate their claims about HOW it operates.
What does NOT match up, however, are their claims about performance speedup. Dr. Troyer, using a server Intel CPU, (8 Core Xeon, with HT enabled) with optimized code, ran a speed test against various topologies of the Ising spin glass problem itself. He found that, with respect to wall-clock time, that not only does the D-Wave chip underperform in the small set size regime, but that, in the large set size regime, (something that you would use this 1000-qubit processor for), it scales almost identically to the Intel hardware, which is obviously, a small fraction of the cost of the D-Wave One/Two/whatever. In fact, there are certain problem topologies that it straight up can not solve within a reasonable time limit, (it is a heuristic solver, so that was almost expected), that the Intel CPU can, (though it takes substantially longer to do so than you would think).
TL;DR - IS a quantum annealer: inherently limited to one type of computation. Performs like shit anyways. Don't buy one unless you want to pump money into the ASIC fabrication supply chain, relating specifically to materials used for qubit systems, (pretty sure that's the only reason Google, etc are selling this so hard).
EDIT: 8 Core Xeon w/ HT. EDIT 2: My post may sound rather incriminating of D-Wave. IMO All of these efforts are useful, the modern CMOS architectures were not built in a day, or even a decade. However, D-Wave has been..... not careful.... when marketing itself, or allowing itself to be reported in the press. For years articles about its machines were mostly incoherent pieces of technobabble with nonsense claims.

What follows is not complete, orthodox or probably very true, but it serve to show how off-beam many worlds has to be. Why does a particle trace a straight line in a cloud chamber? If it's a 'go everywhere, I'm all fuzzy' entity, it should not trace an invariably straight course, respond predictably to magnets and so on. Feynman suggested that the only course that did not have an equal and opposite parallel for it was a straight line: all the other pairs cancelled themselves out. Others said that in order to leave a track, the particle must be decohering as it interacts with the cold gas in the chamber, and so behaves deterministically. But what of light in a vacuum, always going straight, of course pace gravity?
The notion that answers these problems and which still gives you de Broglie and Heisenberg is that our universe is a ""hologram"". That doesn't mean a whisp of light^* , but a low dimension projection of a higher dimension reality. What's that mean? Well, you need four dimensions - that is, four independent numbers, expressed as co-ordinates - in order to locate a point or particle in time. So we talk about our world as being four dimensional. However, if you want to define the momentum of that particle - where its going and how fast - you need another three numbers. So, actually a seven dimension universe, as abstract points do not do anything, that is, exist. Then there's the various fields, such as charge, spin and so on. So where do they live? If particles are excitations of one or more fields, which is fundamental and where - in what dimensions - do they individually live?
Just after the Big Bang, we believe that there were no particles, just very high energy levels (somehow expressed) and fields. As the spacial and time-like fields (our 4D universe) expanded, energy levels dropped - and space became big enough - for particles to drop into existence. So, fields came before particles; indeed, 'before' or co-eval with space-time. So far as we know, fields cannot be split, changed and are immutable. In our hologram, our subset of the universe, combinations fields drop out as particles: the magnetic and electrostatic field drop out as the photon, for example. The photon is there (four numbers having a restricted number of values) and has more or less this momentum (three numbers, again with probabilities that sum to unity under proper manipulation.) Individual particles combinations - a spinning, electrically charged particle, say - to have properties when considered against other fields, such as space or time. As the particles are just epiphenomena of deeper stuff, this is hardly a surprise. Everett is ""about"" decoherence - what happens when a quantum situation makes up its mind. He says that it never does so, so you get endlessly proliferating universes. (But where's the energy?) But what is decoherence? In another view, it's something, probably something deterministic, that is happening in this much more complex space of which we live in a subset. Or, much more fun, is that you have two or more subsets of this higher structure. Each defines the behaviour of the other. Nothing is then ""fundamental"", and exists because the agency of the other structures define it. Decoherence is simply connecting the dots, between out bit of this structure and the others. Indeed, there are sensible theories that suggest that space if not time is derived from quantum entanglement - coherence - and its breakdown. ^* Look up the Maldecena conjecture if you want more on this.";0;dlvjor;[]

Another mindblower: quantum mechanics says that reality only starts to exist when it is observed. You could say that we are all computers that render our reality. Because there are an infinite amount of possibilities in life, our observation forces particles like electrons to collapse into the outcome we finally observe. Why is this?

I only have superficial knowledge of this topic, but I thought that quantum entanglement can't be used for communication like that.

In fact, previous studies have shown that such a real quantum theory can reproduce the outcomes of any multipartite experiment, as long as the parts share arbitrary real quantum states4.

The reason quantum computers are so great at what they do - and yet are still not used in industry - is because with our current technology, they are actually really bad at most things. For example there is no quantum computer in the world that can run a video game.
This quantum computer in question is solving a probability question via sampling. Meaning instead of using formulas to make predictions, the are running some sort of simulation many many times to generate a sampling, and output the value generated from that.
>\[In a traditional system\] The fastest known exact classical algorithm for the standard Boson Sampling problem takes O(((m+n1)/n)n2^(n)) time to produce samples for a system with input size n and m output modes
That big formula is the come complexity, i.e. ""when the input gets bigger, how much longer will the algorithm take? Some systems get relatively faster or slower as input grows. Note the 2^(n), as \`n\` grows, that element sky rockets. That is why a normal computer would take so long.
They don't have the algorithm published, however it is clear based on the time discrepancy that the quantum computers are able to perform the calculation with a different time complexity, removing the \`2^(n)\` portion.";0;k8cxw7;[]

I do like the title's analogy to temperature though. Great way to communicate the concept. It's just that when we discovered that individual particles could be excited, we didn't completely throw out the idea of propagation of heat.";0;8hr7hw;[]

That has lots of exciting potential applications.
In other forms of detection, the quantum state of the photon is projected (and so lost), which would be no good for quantum communications/networking etc. What the team has done is a very difficult experiment, managing to interact with the photon enough to detect its presence without destroying it, but they have not broken the uncertainty principle.

No two electrons of the same orbital can have the same spin. This means if you know the spin of one electron, you also know the spin of the other as it would be the exact opposite value. Given that orbitals aren't flat disks like what is taught in early science classes, and rather a balloon/ring/sphere-shaped probability densities (meaning the electron has a higher probability of being found in the aforementioned regions than elsewhere), the electron could theoretically be at the opposite end of the universe and still maintain its entanglement with its counterpart electron as it relates to their spins.
The shoe store example is akin to the Schrodinger's cat example where the spin is entirely unknown until observed. According to our understanding of quantum mechanics, the electrons are in a superposition of both spin directions until we observe which spin one of the electrons has.

The crypto, security and programming communities better get their shit together fast. Looks like we may only have about 4-6 years to make the switch to post quantum algorithms. Will the PQCrypto NIST competition even be done by then? Looks like they need to be fast-tracked.
However even if they do get done in time I'm not sure there will be much confidence in them just like there's not much confidence or much cryptanalysis in the current post quantum algorithms today. I don't know about you, but for personal communications I'll be ditching any public key schemes and sticking with pre-shared symmetric keys >= 256 bits for a long while yet.";0;6bxf50;[]

Not sure what complexity man created that 100,000 now only = 4, unless there was lot redundancy that the machine did not need to account for.
And not sure how this can be used unless we're really inefficient with data and relied heavily on brute force calculations which is sad if true or you would not have such a huge difference in the outcome.
It is interesting but don't see this as a major breakthrough in most things, as everyone tend to make different code and data sets. how long did it take to read the 100,000 data vs 4 is it 10 hrs faster now or 0.10 seconds?

Neither of these are true - quantum computers certainly can't compete with regular computers for every problem, but there's a rapidly growing list of real-world problems that we know they'll be useful for. Here's a few:
* **Molecular simulation.** Microsoft Research, for example, want to use this problem to design cheap, ecological fertilizers, but others are interested in drug design and materials science (inc. room temp superconductors).
* **Search.** This could just be used for searching through lists of data, but is a more generic tool for just brute-force searching for an answer to a particular hard problem.
* **Optimisation.** The quantum search algorithm gives a modest advantage for optimisation problems on a quantum computer, but is a bit of a blunt tool; researchers have recently written down some quantum algorithms for solving commonly encountered optimisation problems (e.g. semidefinite programs). Early days, but looks promising.
* **Network/graph problems.** Really interesting class of problems if you want to efficiently direct internet traffic, or run a logistics company, or understand biological/sociological networks... the list is endless. There have been lots of new quantum algorithms recently for solving graph problems more quickly, including a gem of a paper on [the travelling salesman problem]( * **Simultaneous equations.** A quantum algorithm for speeding up simultaneous equation solving was published in '09: [Here]( Useful on its own, but is probably going to find more application as a subroutine for machine learning/AI problems.
* **Differential equations.** Among other things, differential equations are ubiquitous in engineering; and solving them numerically is important if, say, you want to model air flow through a turbine, or heat in an engine, or stress on a skyscraper. Here's a paper showing that [quantum computers can be faster at solving differential equations](
* **Monte Carlo methods.** These methods are currently used to help solve a wide-range of problems where some statistical or probabilistic element is involved, e.g. weather forecasting/climate modelling, AI, computational biology and computer graphics (the wiki page has a more [complete list]( Quantum computers have an advantage here, too: [Quantum monte carlo](
* **Machine learning / AI.** There have been lots of published papers outlining specific machine learning tasks that can be sped up by quantum means, but the quality tends to vary wildly. One of my favourites is [a quantum algorithm for the ""Netflix problem""](, where a computer has to recommend new products based on a user's review of things they've already purchased. [Here]( is a decent review of machine learning/AI applications of quantum computers.
Here's a great review, for those interested:

But saying that the cause is a consequence of its own consequence(s) seems to be more of a circular causality than it is reversed causality. It would imply an infinite circle to represent time, which due to its physical constraints cannot be related to what we know as life and of anything considering our universe. I would love to read more about these experiments, if anyone has some links to experiments confirming the hypothesis?
The circular nature of time is an ancient (predominantly) Asian concept which shows quite some flaws in its architecture, as it represents lifecycles as well as passing eras or the birth/death of planets and stars. A more convenient representation would possibly be an infinite helix, not much different from our beta-helix DNA structure, but with an infinite level of possible strands, motives and feedback-loops.

Birds are very good at this, easy to train, and you can set up a self-reinforcing system by having three birds decide for each picture. Whenever there is a disagreement, you go with the majority, and reward the majority with a treat. That provides enough reinforcement to keep the recognition accurate.
You can even train new birds automatically, by having a system where they are paired with a group of already trained birds, and they are rewarded when they agree with the trained group.
B.F. Skinner did a successful demonstration during WWII of how pigeons could be trained to recognize ships and identify them as ours or the enemy's, and could be used to steer guided bombs to the enemy ships.
There was some work after the war into using pigeons to inspect parts on assembly lines. The birds were far more accurate than humans, as humans get tired and have trouble paying attention after hours of watching the same part come by. The birds worked all day, and their accuracy didn't fall off.
Ultimately, the tests were stopped, because the companies that participated thought the public would not understand. They feared the competitors would try to make it sound like using dumb birds to inspect the parts, instead of highly trained humans, meant low quality.
Still, its kind of funny to realize that Google could probably do a better job of automatically classifying things, such as uploaded images, by setting up a bird-based system. I wonder what PETA would think of it?

This isnt a statement about reality somehow being subjective to some conscious human observer. This is only a statement about nonlocality(the idea that particles can be entangled, and dont have hidden local information about their state), and the conclusions you can draw about entangled particles through independent measurement of another entangled particle.
It's really neat, it's a cute result, but it does not mean that your consciousness is somehow ""quantum magical"", or that your perceived reality is somehow unhinged from external reality. Quantum mechanics and consciousness are not related.";0;dwz9ks;[]

In the preprint, it is argued that their device reached quantum supremacy and that a state-of-the-art supercomputer would require approximately 10,000 years to perform the equivalent task.We argue that an ideal simulation of the same task can be performed on a classical system in 2.5 days and with far greater fidelity. This is in fact a conservative, worst-case estimate, and we expect that with additional refinements the classical cost of the simulation can be further reduced.
Because the original meaning of the term quantum supremacy, as proposed by John Preskill in 2012, was to describe the point where quantum computers can do things that classical computers cant, this threshold has not been met.

While scientist work an quantum computers, they will also work on post quantum cryptography - and there is no fundamental reason a normal computer won't be able to use a quantum resistant encryption algorithm.
However scientists like this are mostly over-optimistic with time, and as someone who works in science myself I can tell you this has mostly to do with funding. If you are honest about expecting results in 30 years, you will have a hard time to get money. As far as I know quantum computers are nowhere near cracking actual encryption.
ALSO... The article claims SHA-256 will be broken, and I'm not aware of any quantum algorithm that could crack SHA-256. There is a realistic threat in quantum computers breaking elliptic curve functions (asymmetric cryptography, getting private keys from public keys). However in blockchains like BTC, addresses are generated by hashing from public keys and the pub. keys are only published once you spend. This means even BTC is ""sort-of"" quantum resistant today if you never reuse addresses.";0;10i8mgp;[]

Quantum computers could vastly outperform conventional machines on certain tasks. The goal is to achieve what has come to be known as"" quantum supremacy""where a quantumcomputercan outperform conventional computers on at least one type of task. Until now, only one computer has ever achieved this featGoogle's Sycamore device. And because the field is still so new, researchers around the world are working on vastly different designs. Sycamore was based on qubits represented by superconducting materials. In this new effort, the team in China has developed aphoton-based quantum computer capable of carrying out a single specific type of calculationboson sampling.
I can't even grasp the full significance of what quantum supremacy computing entails, but it really sounds like something out of the 22nd century.

What if a group of 3 particles are entangled, with Alice having 2 and Bob having 1.
At predetermined time intervals (eg every 0.1ms), Bob measures his entangled particle if he wishes to communicate a 1 in binary times. This will cause Alice's two entangled particles (in the same entanglement group) to take form of the same, opposite spin direction of Bob's particle.
Bob does not measure his entangled particle if he wishes to communicate a 0. This keeps all of the 3 entangled particles still in a superposition.
At every 0.1ms, Alice measures both of her entangled particles. If Bob has already measured the entangled particle, Alice will find that both of her entangled particles have the same spin. However, if Bob has not measured, then when Alice measures one of her entangled particles, the other entangled particle will find itself to the opposite spin state, and Alice will find her two entangled particles are different. This would mean that information would be passable.

Perhaps due to its radicalness and thought provoking consequences.Yet there is a reason majority of physicists do not buy it. It interpret the universe as deterministic thus have a hard time explaining the randomness observed. Attempts to derive the Born rule quickly makes its simplicity and elegance disappear. Which is the what make it appealing in the first place.
Personally I'm almost certain it is incorrect. MWI interpret the observed randomness by self-locating probabilities. E.g. even though it is certain a coin toss would split the world into two, where both head and tail happens, it is still unknown which world 'I' am in, thus the observed randomness. This kind of self-locating probabilities use principle of indifference while dealing with the two worlds yet take a special interest in the being of 'me'. In its logic it treats everything with impartiality yet there is a self apparent entity 'I'. It's inconsistent. Such probabilities has caused many anthropic paradoxes such as the doomsday argument, the sleeping beauty problem, the presumptuous philosopher and the simulation argument. That, to me, means MWI is incorrect in a logical sense.";0;dlvjor;[]

Abstract
> Majorana zero-modesa type of localized quasiparticlehold great promise for topological quantum computing1. Tunnelling spectroscopy in electrical transport is the primary tool for identifying the presence of Majorana zero-modes, for instance as a zero-bias peak in differential conductance2. The height of the Majorana zero-bias peak is predicted to be quantized at the universal conductance value of 2e2/h at zero temperature3 (where e is the charge of an electron and h is the Planck constant), as a direct consequence of the famous Majorana symmetry in which a particle is its own antiparticle. The Majorana symmetry protects the quantization against disorder, interactions and variations in the tunnel coupling3,4,5. Previous experiments6, however, have mostly shown zero-bias peaks much smaller than 2e2/h, with a recent observation7 of a peak height close to 2e2/h. Here we report a quantized conductance plateau at 2e2/h in the zero-bias conductance measured in indium antimonide semiconductor nanowires covered with an aluminium superconducting shell. The height of our zero-bias peak remains constant despite changing parameters such as the magnetic field and tunnel coupling, indicating that it is a quantized conductance plateau. We distinguish this quantized Majorana peak from possible non-Majorana origins by investigating its robustness to electric and magnetic fields as well as its temperature dependence. The observation of a quantized conductance plateau strongly supports the existence of Majorana zero-modes in the system, consequently paving the way for future braiding experiments that could lead to topological quantum computing.";0;88i4vl;[]

Is this really new? I seem to remember being shown by my Quantum Field Theory lecturer that it is impossible to have a Field Theory that is both local (i.e. events and their causes happen at the same place) and causal (i.e. events happen after their causes). Either you have action at a distance or, you have causes coming after their effects. Either way, the traditional notion of causality (things cause other things at the same place and in the future) is broken in QFT. As an aside, this seems like a very bad submission. It is of a press release for which there is no paper and the title misrepresents what it is saying anyway. Edit: I was wrong about the paper not being available yet. It is [here]( Still, the link points to a press release which doesn't link to the paper which seems like a bad thing to me. ;0;10vejc;[]

There's the possibility that Eventually our technology would advance to the point that we are able to modify gravity as a wave. If we ever are at that stage we would stand to get the time dilation benefits from that. With the gravity/time difference a machine could run a computational process for a year but provide it to you in 10 minutes because of time dilation. Obviously this is hypothetical, but you could create a prison where 10 years has passed but the outside world only a year has passed. So on and so forth.

I honestly don't know where to start in explaining how wrong it is. This has nothing to do with uncertainty principle. All this allows is the measurement of some properties of the photon without absorbing it. Which is very nice, but - again - this has nothing to do with uncertainty or ""not changing the information they carry"".
What this does allow is multiple measurements of the same photon - which would be useful for a lot of things. Edit: Got my panties slightly more bunched than they should have been. Should have said ""Title is very misleading and somewhat wrong.""";0;1qoox6;[]

The multiple worlds theory uses the subatomic world's reality as a basis for its existence. In the subatomic world, an electron is blurry until it is directly observed. When directly observed it is then in a fixed identifiable position. This tells me the electron exists in multiple places at the same time not that there are multiple electrons in those locations. Therefore if there are multiple worlds with me in it, I will end up in only one location at the point of decision.

A light microscope can't see individual atoms, but the imaging laser causes them to fluoresce, and the microscope captured the flashes of light. When the imaging laser was off, or turned on only dimly, the atoms tunneled freely. But as the imaging beam was made brighter and measurements made more frequently, the tunneling reduced dramatically.*

The team, however, favors a different performance metric than quantum supremacy known as quantum volume, which incorporates a variety of factors such as how error-prone the qubits are and how long they retain their quantum properties. In an October 21 blog post, those IBM researchers argue that their result means that Google hasnt achieved quantum supremacy after all.

For instance, the Bohm interpretation of QM ascribes point-like particles a non-Newtonian motion dictated by the configuration space of the universe which evolves non-locally, ie. superluminally. This non-local interaction can violate Lorentz invariance which to observers can look like the future influencing the past.
So instead of inverting our notion of causality, we can solve this apparent dilemma by abandoning constraints which we thought applied but which really may not. The Bohm interpretation has the added bonus of actually making sense to anyone familiar with classical physics, as opposed to just about every other interpretation of QM.";0;c8b3o;[]

To sum up the ""real karma"" idea: when you see the car you just bought all over the road, it's not because there are more of them on the road, it's because it's become important to you. When you see faces on the street, you remember the ones you know because they're important to you. This is a holdover from our caveman days. ""We need berries"" turned in to finding berries by a trick of the brain.
This translates in our current waking life to seeing what we value, and here is where the karma part comes in. When what we value is goodness and kindness, we can look at the same coffee shop scene and pick out and identify the kind gestures, and the positive elements of the scene. When we value competition, or self worth, we tend to judge based on comparison, and tend to see the negativity in the scene.
To me, this is a very real world example of an idea called karma. Where the lover values the time they had with someone who has passed, the selfish person sinks into sadness for what they lost. The mindsets, with this research, tend to make me think that my pragmatic approach to karma might be a bit too mechanical, and that there might be an actuality to the mindset we carry.";0;dxnw0v;[]

The multiverse stuff from string theory posits universes with different laws of physics that will look nothing like our universe. MWI on the other hand, posit different branching versions of our own universe, but each still has the same physics.
2) MWI is like 60 years old and one of just many interpretations of Quantum Mechanics, the other being the Copenhagen interpretation. in the 60 years, no experiment has been able to say which is the correct interpretation.

I am of course ignoring it's current shortcoming of only working over a short distance, and requiring fiber optics between source and destination to work. However, ignoring the problems to infrastructure with actually implementing QKD, there are a few other weaknesses.
1) Current laser technology requires that you send out a large number of quantum bits, because it is too unreliable to guarantee that a single quantum bit will be generated every time. This means that there are extra quantum bits which could be theoretically intercepted without affecting the rest of the transmission. This means that the inherent security behind QKD is reduced to nothing because ""Eve"" (the attacker in crypto lingo) has only destroyed a few of the quantum bits, rather than the entire communication.
2) Due to limitations in technology, QKD can still be subject to a timing attack, that is measuring the amount of time it takes for the receiving machine to register a quantum bit as either up or down (1 or 0). This is because of minor variations in the distances between the two receptors necessary for measuring a quantum bit. This means that QKD could theoretically be susceptible to a passive attack where Eve measures electrical signals coming from the receiving equipment. (Also important to note that this can be mitigated through random time intervals in the transmission of quantum bits, among other techniques).
3) There is also the risk of a true man in the middle attack where Eve simply measures all the quantum bits transmitted between Alice and Bob, and then simply recreates those bits and forwards them on to Bob. This can be mitigated by precise measurements of the time it should take for a quantum bit to travel between Alice and Bob. If it takes more time than expected, it should be discarded. However, defects in fiber optics and lasers means that Alice and Bob can only measure the time it should take to a certain degree, which would theoretically become less accurate as the distance between Alice and Bob increased. There are other technological weaknesses to QKD, which I can't recall off the top of my head, but the point of all this is to say that while QKD is fascinating technology, and may some day provide the prefect security we are looking for, it is also flawed by our inability to produce perfect machines. There has also been some research into using the laws of thermodynamics to produce a theoretically unbreakable crypto system, but I'll have dig that paper up.";0;1luenb;[]

But in any case, if there at some point should be QC become available that are getting more energy efficient than ASIC, that will only mean another hash power increase similar to what we have seen from CPU -> GPU -> FPGA -> ASIC
The real danger of QC is that there is an quantum-algo that can calculate a private key from a public key. With Bitcoin, the address is actually a double hash of the public key, and the public key is only revealed once you spend the coin. So if you follow best practice and don't reuse addresses you already have some form of quantum resistance.
That being said, obviously Bitcoin would need to adopt a new quantum resistant asymmetric algo to make it impossible again to calculate the private key from a public key. AFAIK that would just be a new address type and only need a soft fork.

Complex numbers *have* been used in quantum physics since the creation of the science. Erwin Schrdinger described their usefulness back in the 20s and 30s. However, the assumption was that complex numbers werent actually *necessary*, and were used as a convenient way to make quantum field equations easier to perform and understand- kind of like the reverse of studying physics using algebra instead of calculus. This study conclusively proves that the usage of complex numbers isnt just a useful expedient- its actually necessary for the math to work out right.;0;rhooth;[]

What we think of as matter are standing waves in the medium of space, continuously propagated by the incoming perturbations of all other material in the universe, which focus their energy into a volume considered to be the atomic nucleus.
Waves by themselves are not physical entities. There is no such thing as a wave. A wave is not an object in of itself, but an action which an object performs.
A wave cannot propagate without some medium in which it can oscillate. For decades popular science has denounced the idea of the luminiferous aether, but logically no other situation is possible.

At its heart lies the private key / public key pairing, secured by SHA256 encryption. If you could try all combinations simultaneously, as with a quantum computer, you could help yourself to the contents of any account.
Bitcoin mining essentially involves being the first to find a SHA256 match or getting close. A quantum computer would make this trivial. Bitcoin does not have an easy upgrade mechanism, so I'm not sure what will happen.
Ethereum are soon moving away from mining. The community has for years recognised quantum computing as an issue, and are relaxed that they have a solution to the private key / public key pairing problem (not sure what it is). They have an established mechanism for upgrading.

> There are many caveats to such controversial claims, however. First and foremost, the evidence for entanglement in this experiment is circumstantial, dependent on how one chooses to interpret the light trickling through and out of the cavity-confined bacteria. Marletto and her colleagues acknowledge a classical model free of quantum effects could also account for the experiments results. But, of course, photons are not classical at allthey are quantum. And yet a more realistic semiclassical model using Newtons laws for the bacteria and quantum ones for photons fails to reproduce the actual outcome Coles and his colleagues observed in their laboratory. This hints that quantum effects were at play in both the light and the bacteria. Its a little bit indirect, but I think its because theyre only trying to be so rigorous in ruling out things and claiming anything too much, says James Wootton, a quantum computing researcher at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory who was not involved in either paper.
> The other caveat: the energies of the bacteria and the photon were measured collectively, not independently. This, according to Simon Grblacher of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands who was not part of this research, is somewhat of a limitation. There seems to be something quantum going on, he says. Butusually if we demonstrate entanglement, you have to measure the two systems independently to confirm any quantum correlation between them is genuine.

So trolling the Googlenet, you come up with such joys as ""*Scotch eggheads take first-ever snap of quantum entanglement*"" (Scottish?).
Finally, [this]( from AAAS Science. > Here, we report an experiment demonstrating the violation of a Bell inequality within observed images. It is based on acquiring full-field coincidence images of a phase object probed by photons from an entangled pair source.
They generate two entangled photons, but sparsely, so these tend to arrive a pair at at time with a gap between them. They hit a beam splitter, which can do several things, but one of these is to reflect one of the two photons into another arm of the system and also to let the other one pass straight through it. The one that passes through is then filtered for its polarisation (sort of) and then hits a detector so sensitive that it reacts to a single photon. That event is signalled to a camera, which is staring down the other arm of the array. The second photon is, of course, passing along this arm. The whole thing is physically engineered so that the detector's signal to the camera and the arrival of this other photon will coincide: ker-snap. Before it gets there, however, this second photon has to pass through another (sort of) polariser. These sort-of-polarisers are objects which change a photon's phase. I won't unbundle this, but these constitute:
> a circular phase step and [...] a straight-edged phase step [which] are placed [individually] within separated optical arms, and [which] are probed by [the] two entangled photons. This setup would, if placed together in a single arm and with a single photon, produce an image in which the circular filter blocks out the pair of photons altogether by making them interfere with each other. This would generate an image of a black circle surrounded by dots from individual photons that missed it. The image is, of course, generated by many, many separate pairs of photons. This black circle is what you see in the photograph, except that the two filters are not in the same place, but are **physically separate and acting on two, entangled photons**. That is, entangled photons essentially ignore separation when something is done to one or the other of them,. There's a bit more to it, showing that Bell's Inequality, the standard test for entanglement, is indeed violated. This is complex, see Eq. 4 if you don't believe me.";0;cch4o7;[]

Our naive thought is that is that there is a hidden variable. For instance, when we first entangle A and B, A is actually Up, which causes B to spin Down and we don't find this out until we measure. So, it would be no more controversial or confusing than saying >Mike has a blue ball and a red ball. He puts one of the balls in the mail and it goes to Alpha Centari. Once it gets there, Mike shows us he has the red ball and now we instantly know the color of the ball in Alpha Centari.
If this was the case, there would be no spooky action and everything would make good logical sense.
This is what Bell's Theorem is about. It shows, through experimentation, that there is no set of hidden variables that explain the observed phenomena. Instead, the particles must have both states and they collapse when observed, but the entangled particles always collapse in pairs. This is actually a good reason why this belongs in a philosophy sub, because it was this logic argument that proved local realism was impossible.
So the particles aren't transferring a property forward through time, because they have no properties to transfer. They are instead creating a bridge that spans across time. The major thing that quantum physics brings to philosophy isn't the concept of the observer, but rather that quantum systems seem to violate the core rule of logic A/=~A. Particles have contradictory properties and display different factors of those contradictory properties based on how we measure them. So we, by choosing how to measure a value, can change it's properties.";0;9l1wd9;[]

However, quantum computers are only superior for solving quantum algorithms since qubits can represent quantum states exponentially faster than a classic computer can ""simulate"" them. So the second aspect of this field is the discovery of quantum algorithms that can surpass ""classic"" ones. The most famous example is probably ""Shor's Algorithm"" which devised a quantum algorithm that could solve the math used in many types of encryption more efficiently than a classical algorithm. What it boils down to then is the following comparison:
Volume of information processed by a Quantum Computer multiplied by the time efficiency (called time complexity) of a Quantum Algorithm <VERSUS> Volume of information processed by a Classic Computer multiplied by the time efficiency of a Classic Algorithm.
Given the complexity and requirements behind a Quantum Computer, its real world application is completely dependent on the application of Quantum Algorithms. Where classic algorithms are already efficient (e.g. binary search), classic computers will likely reign supreme until the end of time. Furthermore, even where the Quantum Algorithm is clearly superior for a specific problem (Shor's Algorithm), we are still a long ways from a Quantum Computer that has enough Qubits to carry out the necessary calculations (one estimate suggests millions of qubits may be required due to error/noise correction).";0;dlz540;[]

Rather, Science is a model-building enterprise and scientific theories are models which are constructed for practical purposes.
Indeed, with the arrival of clocks, which when they broke down need to replace certain parts for it to work again (patching), we then started to see the world as a piece of complex machinery and our scientific theories began to work like this too (patching + neuromyths). Neuromyths change as Technologies evolve. We project our technological advancement into the most puzzling aspect of Beings, the brain, and the consciousness.

**Steve Gibson explains the problems with quantum communications**
**tl;dr** >...an Internet requires routing. And no one has been able to figure out how to do a quantum router. And you could argue that a quantum router breaks the security because **routing requires looking at the address and then sending it out in the proper direction. And the act of looking at the address means that now you have - you've penetrated the security of the link.** The idea with so-called ""quantum communications"" is that it is utterly secure. It is more secure than any cryptography because, after all, there is a key somewhere; and, if the bad guy knew the key, unlikely as that may be, then they can decrypt what you've got... ...Quantum communications, the whole concept is the act of receiving the information changes it. So the idea is you cannot tap a quantum communication, which is being done by photons over a fiber optic cable. The whole deal is that any - the act of observing the information, in a quantum physics sense, makes that event detectable. I don't know if it collapses the state, or if it alters it. But there is absolutely, I mean, the physicists know it cannot be intercepted or eavesdropped on. Well... we do know from current quantum physics that that is the case. So what has been done is a quantum link has been set up that allows information to flow. And the problem is **an Internet requires routing**. And no one has been able to figure out how to do a quantum router. And you could argue that a quantum router breaks the security because **routing requires looking at the address and then sending it out in the proper direction. And the act of looking at the address means that now you have - you've penetrated the security of the link.** So the way they solve that is they use a **hub** instead of routing. So, like, so all of the nodes have a fiber optic connection into a hub. So, first of all, **now we don't really have an Internet.** Now we have a hub, which is not nearly as exciting because they don't know how to do quantum routing. And you could argue that you can't. Then the problem is, to have it be really secure, they would have to have it go in both directions. But that would require two links, and that would double the cost. And so they said, well, we don't want to do that. Well, okay. ";0;1luenb;[]

No photonic machine offering programmability over all its quantum gates has demonstrated quantum computational advantage: previous machines1,2 were largely restricted to static gate sequences. Earlier photonic demonstrations were also vulnerable to spoofing3, in which classical heuristics produce samples, without direct simulation, lying closer to the ideal distribution than do samples from the quantum hardware. Here we report quantum computational advantage using Borealis, a photonic processor offering dynamic programmability on all gates implemented. We carry out Gaussian boson sampling4 (GBS) on 216 squeezed modes entangled with three-dimensional connectivity5, using a time-multiplexed and photon-number-resolving architecture. On average, it would take more than 9,000years for the best available algorithms and supercomputers to produce, using exact methods, a single sample from the programmed distribution, whereas Borealis requires only 36s. This runtime advantage is over 50 million times as extreme as that reported from earlier photonic machines. Ours constitutes a very large GBS experiment, registering events with up to 219 photons and a mean photon number of 125. This work is a critical milestone on the path to a practical quantum computer, validating key technological features of photonics as a platform for this goal""

The idea is that a one-time pad needs to offer the same set of random numbers to two parties. Usually, you use classical means to deliver two copies of the same set of randomly generated bits.
You could instead deliver entangled atoms to two parties with an ordering. Then, to send a message over classical channels, you measure atoms as you need more random bits. The other party will measure their atoms (that are no longer in the same state superposition) when they receive the message to decode the transmitted message.
There is no speedup, of course, but the one benefit I can see is that the random numbers are not known or shared beforehand. They are ""simultaneously"" generated at both sites. This may have a security benefit.";0;vu7s81;[]

They did not reverse time.
> Although this phenomenon is not observed in nature, it could theoretically happen due to a random fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background permeating the universe. The team set out to calculate the probability to observe an electron ""smeared out"" over a fraction of a second spontaneously localizing into its recent past. It turned out that even if one spent the entire lifetime of the universe -- 13.7 billion years -- observing 10 billion freshly localized electrons every second, the reverse evolution of the particle's state would only happen once. And even then, the electron would travel no more than a mere one ten-billionth of a second into the past.
So just for those playing along at home: 1. Not in nature
2. ""could"" happen due to ""random""
3. on a scale so ridiculously enormous it looks like a simple ""significant digit"" error more than anything concretely measurable.

This article is ridiculously misleading. They cannot ""affect"" one particle or diamond with the other as they described. But I'm not even going to explain the other fallacies except for one single sentence which should seal the deal. ""Another study recently used quantum entanglement to teleport bits of light from one place to another.""
NO NO NO NO NO
Instantaneous teleportation is in fact quicker than the speed of light. If this actually happened then that whole fiasco with the neutrino would not have happened. They most certainly did not teleport anything at all.
This is a terrible article, stop voting it up.
EDIT: The term ""quantum teleportation"" may still describe what was done to the packets of light, but the way that this article presents it is misleading. It is a very large misnomer. They did not actually physically move packets of light from place to another instantly.";0;mwole;[]

Maybe the speedup is confined to subcellular processes? Or maybe it's the exact opposite?
This idea is at least as old as Schrodinger's ""What Is Life?"" (which was apparently read by undergrad James Watson) but it got less popular after the 60s. The book ""How the Hippies Saved Physics"" paints a rosy historical picture of this, but in reality I think one too many gurus getting proto-metooed, plus incidents like the Waco seige, and Woodstock #1 through the one in the 90s where a Hell's Angel killed a guy, maybe all these kinda soured the public perception of Deepak/Hameroff guru-types dressed like Jedis instructing people about quantum souls or whatever.
Doesn't change the fact that photosynthesis, avian magnetoreception, and even freaking gecko feet have evolved to make use of nontrivially nonclassical resources.

Quantum encryption relies on the fact that you can verify a transmission has not been intercepted, as an independent observer world collapse the superposition. Does this experiment prove that this is not the case after all?
What if both observers write down their result on a piece of paper, would the result on that paper be different for everyone who looks at it?
What if a major decision, such as the election of a president were based on such a random result rather than a vote? Would the Butterfly Effect ripple from there and cause each person to live in either reality A or B? I could live in a world where Trump was in power, yet my wife would live in a world where Clinton won. Normal physical 'randomness' (like a coin toss) is a sum of many probabilities that collapse in a predictable result as long as you know enough about the initial conditions, so that we mostly follow the same timeline. But when you base a major decision on a single quantum event, reality splits differently for EVERYONE.";0;b1ksk6;[]

Heisenberg is just as uncertain as he has always been. A qubit is a bit that can exist in a superposition of 1 and 0. That means that when you 'measure' the qubit you have a certain chance of observing a 1, and a certain chance of observing a 0.
You can, by the way, think of the bits in your computer as special cases of qubits, where they are in one of two states: (state 1) 100% chance to measure 1 or (state 2) 100% chance to measure 0.
A qubit meanwhile, could be prepared in (state 3): 50% chance to measure 0, 50% chance to measure 1, or (state 4): 75% chance to measure 0, 25% chance to measure 1, or any one of an infinite number of states.
Qubits are exposed to a lot of noise from the environment ( like electromagnetic waves and whatnot. ) Noise can change the state of a qubit, perhaps moving a qubit that was in state 3 to state 3.01: 51% 0, 49% 1. You might think of this noise as 'partial measurement', because it changes the state of the qubit, but only sorta.
What these guys are saying, is that they are able to track this partial measurement as it occurs to their qubit. So, if they know they prepared a qubit in state 3; they can watch the noise that happens to it; and know that its been transferred to a different state.
They cannot control the noise. They can only monitor how the state of the qubit is changing. Importantly, they still don't know if they are going to see a 0 or 1 when they measure it, they only know that the state has changed.
I hope that was clear, helpful and accurate!

QKD is not ""un-hackable"", it's just a more secure solution to the key exchange problem. This means you will now be able tell when someone intercepted the key exchange (from within the fiber network) and can renegotiate a new key exchange that isn't compromised. This would make Man-in-the-middle attacks more difficult, but not impossible. Those fiber endpoint servers are still going to be accessed through the conventional internet meaning an attacker can still intercept the key negotiation anywhere outside the fiber network without anyone knowing. Also, once the key exchange is complete, the rest of the communication between the two parties will take place over conventional internet relying on encryption for security. Theoretically, a truly dedicated party could still save this exchange to a server somewhere and eventually brute-force it over the course of many, many, many years or wait for a quantum computer to come along that is able to decrypt it using Shor's algorithm or some variation. This is why QKD needs to be combined with truly quantum-safe algorithms to protect encryption-based communication in the age of quantum computers, and currently none exist.
TLDR: Calling QKD ""un-hackable"" is completely misguided, it would be more accurate to say this will allow for more secure communications in the future but I suppose that wouldn't generate as many ""clicks"" as the current headline.";0;ny3g3u;[]

IN SIMPLE TERMS:
Quantum teleportation is about information. It is sending information about the ""quantum state"" (the mathematical variables regarding a system) of a particular particle from one point to another. In the future, it might be useful for things like GPS systems and *really fast-loading porn*.
Normal teleportation is what you're thinking about. That's more akin to if you were to pick yourself apart, atom by atom, with tweezers or the like, and reassembled yourself elsewhere. You'd probably die in the process unless it was happening at near the speed of light, yeah, but it does raise some interesting philosophical questions regarding things like ""if you DID pick yourself apart, atom by atom, and put yourself back together - would you be the same person?""

>In the laboratory setup used in the new work, Alice and Bob communicate via laser pulses. Each pulse represents a single ball. The pulses go through a beam splitter, which sends half of each pulse toward Alice and half toward Bob. As a pulse passes by Alice, she can shift something called the phase of the laser pulse to encode information about each ball whether its red or blue.
>Meanwhile Bob encodes information about the pairs of balls he cares about into his half of the laser pulses. The pulses then converge in another beam splitter, where they interfere with each other. The way in which the two sets of pulses interfere with each other reflects differences in the way the phase of each pulse has been shifted. Bob can read the interference pattern on nearby photon detectors.
>Up until the moment that Bob reads Alices laser message, Alices quantum message is capable of answering any question about any pair. But in the act of reading the quantum message, he destroys it, yielding information about just one pair of balls.

Entanglement does not mean that if you change the spin of one particle, the other will change instantaneously, in a predictable manner, no matter the distance. This is one of the largest and frustrating misconceptions about quantum mechanics in the layman's perspective. I am no physicist, but I have studied quantum mechanics and this topic specifically. I believe ""entanglement"" has more to do with the measurement of the spin of particles on the quantum level. If they are ""entangled"", knowing the spin(or whatever it is your looking for) of one particle will indicate to you with 99% certainty the spin of the other. Like I said, I'm not a physicist, but I'am certain that the whole ""instant communication"" end of it is absolutely false.

But as the imaging beam was made brighter and measurements made more frequently, the tunneling reduced dramatically.
So is it the act of observing that has the effect, or the imaging laser?

Can someone calm my fear-addled reptile brain? I don't know anywhere near enough about this side of things, but enough about global digital patching (we're so much more sprawled than Y2K with technology).
Is this going to be a tool controlled by states to be able to crack and access citizen data at will? Who determines the application and use of this while global infrastructure is vulnerable to brute forcing from these machines?

One way to do this is through the use of a quantum time evolution operator, which describes how a quantum system changes over time.
In the case of the ""quantum time flip"", the researchers used a special optical crystal to split a photon, or packet of light, into two paths. One path traveled through the crystal, while the other path did not. The researchers found that the path of the photon through the crystal exhibited a temporal behavior known as ""time reversal,"" in which the photon appeared to travel backward in time.
This effect is not the same as true time travel, as it does not involve the actual reversal of the flow of time. Instead, it is a quantum phenomenon that arises due to the way that the quantum system is prepared and measured.
It is important to note that this type of quantum time manipulation is still a subject of active research and is not fully understood. Further study is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and potential applications of these phenomena.";0;zloibj;[]

This has been demonstrated with record-breaking speed and accuracy. The breakthrough is set to resolve a major challenge in building quantum computers **large and powerful enough to tackle complex problems that are important to society.** > Currently, quantum computers operate on the 100-qubit scale, but to answer crucial problems that cannot be solved by todays supercomputers, experts predict that millions of qubits will be required.1,2 There is a global quantum race to develop quantum computers that can assist in complex societal challenges, such as drug discovery and improving the energy efficiency of fertiliser production.
> In a new research paper scientists demonstrated how they have used a novel technique, called UQ Connect, to use electric field links to enable qubits to move from one quantum computing microchip module to another with unparalleled speed and precision.
> The scientists were successful in transporting the qubits with a 99.999993% success rate and a connection rate of 2424/s. These numbers are both world records and orders of magnitude better than previous solutions. While linking the modules at world-record speed, the scientists confirmed that the quantum nature of the qubit remains untouched during transport. For instance, the qubit can be both zero and one at the same time.";0;10z0gme;[]

Quantum entanglement occurs when you can precisely align two particles in just the right way (that's not to say it can't occur randomly in nature). In this case we are talking about electrons. Theoretically, you can entangle any property of two particles. Practically, we do this with spin. Spin is the property of electrons which is effectively a little bar magnet which can either be pointed up or down. North on top South on bottom or vice versa. We can entangle the spin of two electrons, but it is very difficult to do at room temperature because there's a lot of heat. Heat causes things to jiggle around so aligning things (entangling the particles) is very tough.
When two particles are entangled and their spin is measured you immediately know how the spin of the other particle will be measured. It could be on the other side of the universe and you would be able to know it's spin. From a practical stand point the ability to do this will help with quantum computers as qbits require a similar preparation to the electrons I just described. Unfortunately instant long distance communication via this method is theoretically impossible, but that's another post.";0;3tllus;[]

At the end of the day, the ability to keep these particles in their state for however long is a feat, but as far as quantum computers being involved, I don't see why it's even mentioned. The qubits don't seem to be manipulable, can't communicate with each other (which would be needed for any computing), demonstrated nothing about superposition theories, and nothing was actually *done* as far as calculations were concerned. Don't get me wrong. I can see this is a huge step in getting stable qubits, but this is really, really far from any sort of control of them.;0;1qowyb;[]

I'm not going to lie, 9 years seems like a long ways away, but cryptographers work with generally long timelines, which why [they're standardizing now]( and have been [talking about it in an organized fashion for a long time, ~2006]( It's also why [google has been experimenting with PQ Crypto since 2016 in Google chrome](
What I'm getting at is preparations for both centralized and decentralized systems need to start now or soon, and decentralized systems even earlier. While 5 years does seem unrealistic, this isn't something that I think bitcoin should be waiting *until* it's a problem, especially as it approaches a trillion dollar marketcap (speculation, but this year?). To put another way, the chance of a black swan event might be low, but the severity would be very high. I wont get into difficulties of migration to a Post-Quantum scheme.
I guess, I use BTC day to day (or at least week to week) and would like to see a *precautionary* approach rather than a reactionary one. There are issues to overcome like scaling, but the bottom line is that it's the security that's the basis of the bitcoin ledger and without it, everything falls apart. If it falls apart, I will have to keep on using banks for much longer.";0;8kipnn;[]

But in a 1935paper, Einstein and his co-authors showed how entanglement leads to whats now calledquantum nonlocality, the eerie link that appears to exist between entangled particles. If two quantum systems meet and then separate, even across a distance of thousands of lightyears, it becomes impossible to measure the features of one system (such as its position, momentum and polarity) withoutinstantlysteering the other into a corresponding state.
You can't transmit meaningful information using entangled particles. If 2 people entangled 2 particles and separated by 100 light years, neither would even know when the other party observed their corresponding particle, if at all. All that happens is that when they get together later on and share what they observed, they will see that their particles were measured as expected. Not sure why this misleading text is here.";0;9l1wd9;[]

As a scientist in this field I am compelled to say that this article very badly represents the facts and implications of the experiment that was done. Quantum states are not ""collapsed"" or ""uncollapsed."" The degree of collapse is directly related to (and actually caused by) the amount of information extracted from the system.
The reason it is hard to make measurements with extract a small amount of information is that you usually have so many extra degrees of freedom interacting with your detector that you can't separate the information coming from the intended system from information coming from the environment. This environmental information is normally called ""noise."" What's special about the experiment here is that the Berkeley team made an amplifier so good that it picks up almost zero noise. The article's claim that this was the first experiment to make a weak enough measurement that the quantum state survived is incorrect. What's true is that they made very weak measurements with signal to noise ratio high enough that those measurements actually provided useful information, which could then be used to create a sensible feedback signal.";0;10yemu;[]

>D-Wave founder Geordie Rose claims that D-Wave has now accomplished its goal of building a quantum computer that, in his words, is better at something than any other option available. This claim has been widely and uncritically repeated in the press, so that much of the nerd world now accepts it as fact. However, the claim is not supported by the evidence currently available. It appears that, while the D-Wave machine does outperform certain off-the-shelf solvers, **simulated annealing codes have been written that outperform the D-Wave machine on its own native problem when run on a standard laptop**. More research is needed to clarify the issue, but in the meantime, it seems worth knowing that this is where things currently stand.

Some argue that Dark Matter is real, and it is in fact a kind of matter... a kind of ""stuff""... most likely made up of a type of particle we haven't discovered yet. It is believed to be a particle that has mass (thus gravity), but doesn't interact very strongly with regular matter or light. --------------------------------
Others argue that it is NOT actual matter or stuff, but rather some kind of strange property of the Universe. They usually argue it is some kind of misunderstanding of gravity, just as this latest article is trying to do, by arguing that gravity is somehow an emergent phenomena of quantum entanglement, or quantum effects of some sort. --------------------------------
But... the problem is... is that there is ever increasing evidence that points towards Dark Matter as being real stuff. A kind of undiscovered particle most likely, that has mass. --------------------------------
One of the big problems with the opposite theories, that say there is NO such thing in space known as ""Dark Matter""...
Is that we've actually used Dark Matter for scientific purposes! Yes, we've made use of it, before we even understand what it is! Essentially we've used Dark Matter to act as a giant gravitational lens, to enhance and magnify distant objects behind the Dark-Matter cloud. And sure enough, Dark Matter functions perfectly as a gravitational lens, in exactly the same way regular matter functions as a gravitational lens. --------------------------------
There is also other evidence that Dark Matter is real ""stuff"", such as the fact that we've recently discovered galaxies with no Dark Matter effects. So if you're going to argue that the effects of Dark Matter is an inherent property of the Universe, or a misunderstanding of gravity (rather than actual material stuff) then why do some places in the Universe appear not to have that inherent property you are trying to argue for? Essentially properties and forces work the same throughout the Universe. But matter is not spread out evenly in the Universe. --------------------------------
So again... if Dark Matter was a property or force, then you would see it acting the same on ALL galaxies. But some galaxies have virtually no Dark Matter effects what-so-ever. In cases like that it makes much more sense to awesome Dark Matter is real stuff, and that the concentration of that stuff is simply lower in some parts of the universe, and higher in other parts of the universe (just as ""normal"" matter also concentrates). --------------------------------
FURTHER... The oscillation of the Cosmic Microwave Background supposedly provides very strong support to the idea that Dark Matter is stuff. If Dark Matter was not stuff the oscillation would be different. (Admittedly I personally don't really understand that particular oscillation-evidence, as it's not something I've read up on yet.) --------------------------------
There's yet more evidence for Dark Matter as ""stuff"" and a ""particle"" but I'll stop here!
In short, the vast majority of astrophysicists I tend to follow seem increasingly more certain that Dark Matter is real matter... A strange kind of matter we do not yet understand...
But matter that we've already been able to use to our advantage (such as gravitational lensing)!

1) Quantum computers are very hard to control considering it's ""quantum"" and very sensitive i.e. there is a chance that your 1 or 0 could be both or none which allows super-positioning for quantum computer (wiki: qubit) but also more errors from like your elbow hitting the table.
2) This paper is based only on finally strongly coupling spin states but it's a very VERY far way from making an actual processor doing operations. Basically, they got the very basic first step down.";0;stjso;[]

It's like if a tower of cards fell, then I kick the table and they rebuilt themselves to the previous state ( only a fraction of time though, so let's say only the first row was rebuilt ).
Or did I misinterpret this.

>Here is an example: theoretical physics has not done great in the last decades. Why? Well, one of the reasons, I think, is that it got trapped in a wrong philosophy: the idea that you can make progress by guessing new theory and disregarding the qualitative content of previous theories. This is the physics of the why not? Why not studying this theory, or the other? Why not another dimension, another field, another universe? Science has never advanced in this manner in the past. Science does not advance by guessing. It advances by new data or by a deep investigation of the content and the apparent contradictions of previous empirically successful theories. Quite remarkably, the best piece of physics done by the three people you mention is Hawkings black-hole radiation, which is exactly this. But most of current theoretical physics is not of this sort. Why? Largely because of the philosophical superficiality of the current bunch of scientists.
His over all assessment is that there has been too much focus on building new, hardly verifiable, theories to the detriment of efforts aimed at a better understanding of the contradictions between QM/GR. I have some questions regarding this:
1. Could any physicists chime in and evaluate how accurate the above picture of 'theoretical physics over the past few decades' is? IIRC, string theories have been used successfully to predict some previously difficult to calculate stuff. Furthermore, I have a hard time to believe that theorists' completely forgot about the reasons for their new toy models. I have a feeling that maybe the majority of theorists already understood the problems to a degree where they didn't manage to obtain any new information from the old models' contradictions, and hence started to apply new heuristics to find other possibilities. 2. Even if the above picture is true, how exactly does this stem from any philosophical shortcomings? I agree that it sounds as if people might have forgotten some lessons drawn out of the history of science and some of the succcessful methods for finding new theories *up to modern times*. But why should those methods again be successful? Why are they somehow embedded into one large epistemological truth about how to obtain 'theories'? It seems like a rather unfounded statement to me.
Lastly, I would like to comment on the statement that ""scientists bash philosophy"". This has its roots in both fields. Speaking as a mathematician, there is no feeling whatsoever that there is something philosophy can contribute *to the practical, day-to-day workings* of a mathematician. Whether this is true I do not know. I understand that my intuitive understanding of mathematical objects living somewhere might be wrong, but it yields results and is easily compatible with my intuition, which is really what's doing all of the work. It's a nice thought experiment that it might be wrong, but I will not be gutting myself from my best methods of finding out new maths until you give me an at least equally potent alternative. If you want scientists to have ""sane views"" towards philosophy, then of course it is up to us to listen to you. But it is also up to you to deliver something which helps us do our work. This is often amplified by the fact that many philosophical comments stem from people who have never done science in their life, and subsequently give input which is blatantly unapplicable. And, equally embarassing, are scientists who have never tried to do any serious philosophy making off-hand statement about its general uselessness.

I was under the impression that the spookiness was an artifact of our limited ability to determine quantum states, that manipulating an entangled particle doesn't actually affect the other one. LIke if we've got two entangled particles and we observe the state of one, when we observe the state of the other it will always be the counterpart to the first, even if they're way too far apart to be influencing each other. As opposed to an ansible like the one in mass effect, actively manipulating the state of a particle to produce instantaneous changes in a particle somewhere else and being able to do it over and over again with one particle.

The cat is either dead or alive. It is never both, and checking it is not what causes the uncertainty to resolve.

I'm pretty sure I understand this and will try to ELI^(1)5 for you. (I am speculating in the last part of this as it was not spelled out in the article.)
**Part the first**: *how things are done now.*
1. Radio signals are very weak.
2. An amplifier stage increases the signal strength to something more useable
3. A demodulation circuit converts the amplified signal from one of the many analog-domain modulation techniques (AM/FM/PSK) to the digital realm.
**Part the second**: *why this doesn't work at very large frequencies.*
1. Demodulation circuits make use of ""large scale"" circuits consisting of, for example, op-amps and tank circuits, or signal mixers and phase shifters.
2. The elements in these circuits have ""large"" inherent capacitance.
3. Capacitance causes a lag between the introduction of current and a corresponding rise in voltage level.
4. When the frequency you are trying to detect gets high enough, there is not enough charge flow to create a detectable voltage change; ergo, the signal is not detectable.
**Part the third**: *Tunneling transistors are very sensitive.*
1. Tunnel FET transistors can be actuated with minuscule voltage changes --- the kind of voltage changes that correspond to radio waves without amplification.
**Part the fourth**: *What would happen if you hooked up a plain FET vs. a T-FET to an antenna as a pure current switch (rather than an amplifier)?*
1. For a T-FET, anytime the incoming signal was high, the T-FET would conduct, and when the incoming signal was low, the T-FET would not conduct. The average antenna voltage would be 0v, and the T-FET would be on about 50% of the time and produce a steady stream of current. Not very useful.
2. For a FET, the transistor would never activate.
**Part the fifth**: *New graphene transistors can be switched from FET to TunnelFET.*
1. It's great that Tunnel FET transistors actuated with very little voltage, but that doesn't make them useful for much directly (in terms of RF).
2. The new graphine transistor can be switched from FET to TunnelFET on demand: a very sensitive radio-wave detector one moment, an insensitive normal FET the next, then back again.
**Part the sixth** (Speculative): *Future research will be to switch these graphene transistors from T-FET to FET at THz frequencies*
1. If you peek at the incoming antenna voltage at time intervals that match a carrier frequency's peaks, the voltage will not, on average, be 0.
2. If you switch the transistor from FET to T-FET in time to the carrier frequency's peaks, the transistor is only ""looking"" at the antenna when the carrier is at a maximum value.
3. While in T-FET mode, on average, the T-FET should be ON more than it is OFF if the carrier is present, but only on 50% of the time if the carrier is not present (due to off-carrier RF noise).
4. If the output of this T-FET/FET hybrid is low-pass filtered by a very tiny capacitor (say, that naturally present on the input stage to an amplifier), you should be able to detect when the carrier is present vs. not present: a simple two-element AM detector operating at THz frequencies.
**TLDR**: ***A contemporary radio receiver consists of many elements that do not respond quickly enough to decode Thz information. The new transistors offer a way to build a radio receiver that consists of only two elements (in the signal path) that respond much more quickly and can demodulate much higher frequencies.***";0;ld51by;[]

I am not saying science is retarded, im just saying that when you start building theory's off of other theory's and continue in building theory's ontop of theory's, eventually the entire structure of the grand idea becomes hollow and doesnt support itself. Theory's are simply educated ideas to further understanding, based off of a few concrete facts. And just because something is based off of fact doesnt make it a concrete fact. No one can account for the random activities and patterns that Chaos has had on the universe in the billions of years before we existed.
If mankind would quit focusing so much on ""where we came from"", which dont get me wrong is a fucking fascinating subject, and focus more on ""where we are going"" we would be better off preserving our species and existence. And it matters to preserve our existence, as people, because if we have no one to pass our knowledge onto then it will be inevitably be forgotten and lost. And then all that work and resources spent will be for nothing in the large scheme of things.
If you focus to much on the past you will miss the future.
Anyone care to debate?

The photons are then sent down the fiber optic cables to meet at a receiving station in the middle. There, the photons undergo a joint measurement, which entangles them and because theyre each already entangled with their own atom, the two atoms become entangled with each other as well.
The key is that the mediating photons were converted into a longer wavelength so that they travel further through the fibers
So, if I had an entangled pair set a distance apart, and an unentangled pair set a the distance apart, lasered em up until four photons were sent to the receiving station, Id end up with an entangled pair(1) and an unentangled pair(0). Well, thats some pretty useful information.";0;vu7s81;[]

>Here is an example: theoretical physics has not done great in the last decades. Why? Well, one of the reasons, I think, is that it got trapped in a wrong philosophy: the idea that you can make progress by guessing new theory and disregarding the qualitative content of previous theories. This is the physics of the why not? Why not studying this theory, or the other? Why not another dimension, another field, another universe? Science has never advanced in this manner in the past. Science does not advance by guessing. It advances by new data or by a deep investigation of the content and the apparent contradictions of previous empirically successful theories. Quite remarkably, the best piece of physics done by the three people you mention is Hawkings black-hole radiation, which is exactly this. But most of current theoretical physics is not of this sort. Why? Largely because of the philosophical superficiality of the current bunch of scientists.
He's saying that philosophical idiocy is harming physics, not that philosophy is required for physicists to do good physics. EDIT: Also, the musings of one physicist working in an already kind of fringe area of physics does not really hammer home proof or support one way or the other.";0;2e9qe8;[]

For one, if the information is being stored in photonic qubits, then the qubits themselves don't really have a ""temperature"". Temperature is a bulk property of matter and photons are single particles (sure, you can define effective temperatures for some other systems, but for single photons it doesn't really make sense). Similarly, the article seems to imply that people are avoiding storing the photons in big freezers? It's a strange thought to say the least.
I have only read the abstract of the paper so far, but as far as I can tell the important thing here is that they are using an atomic vapour to generate single photons, and it is that vapour which is at room temperature. There have also been experiments which use ultracold vapours to generate single photons, but it's important to know that an ultracold vapour doesn't necessarily mean a big freezer cooling things to <1 K. It often is just a vacuum chamber and an atomic cloud that has been *laser* cooled, while the apparatus itself remains at or slightly below room temp. The advantage over those systems is not needing those cooling stages, as many magnetic field coils, etc etc.
Edit: I'll also add that I think there have also been other types of quantum memories demonstrated with storage times on the order of milliseconds (and I think even seconds). Again the advantage here seems to be simplicity.";0;o3ro5d;[]

This article is basically saying researchers finally have a 300-bit quantum computer. To represent the state of an n-qubit system on a classical computer would require the storage of 2^n complex coefficients. That would mean 2^300 complex coefficients on a classical computer. Up until now, scientists have been finding it really hard to create large quantum bit configurations. (where large is more than 16 or so) Let it also be known that general purpose quantum decryption has a time complexity of O( 2^n/2 ) where n is keylength in bits. This is half the degree of general purpose normal decryption, which is awesome, but all you have to do is double the keylength for all your encryption. (and not use RSA encryption) So they have a quantum computer with a lot more memory.;0;stjso;[]

We know that intelligence is possible, we see it in nature. We know that quantum computing works, and does things in a pretty unique sort of way, mostly by utilizing superpositions(to the best of my knowledge). This technology has not ever been seen in a large-scale implementation. So what's the basis for all the skepticism?

Whereas the bits of a normal computer are binary 1s or 0s, on or off the processing rate ofquantum computersis much faster because they utilize 'qubits,' which can be 1 and 0, on and off at the same time. One way to build a quantum computer would be to link myriad time crystals, each one designed to act as a qubit. Therefore, this first experiment to link two time crystals has created the basic building block of a quantum computer.
Previous experiments have already shown that some time crystals can operate at room temperature, rather than needing to be cooled to nearly absolute zero, making their construction even easier. The next task, Autti's team said, is to demonstrate that logic gate operations, which are functions that allow a computer to process information, can operate between two or more time crystals.
The research was published June 2 in the journalNature Communications.";0;van9q0;[]

The major novelty here is that a partial, non-demolition measurement was carried out with superconducting qubitsthe new poster child of experimental quantum information processing. With photons, this has been done long ago (and I'm sort of annoyed that a lot of very similar work on this field wasn't cited in the Yale study).
Just like any QM text-book will tell you, a measurement of a quantum state will collapse that state onto some observable. We don't have to extract full information though, we can also partially collapse the state, by weakly coupling it to an ancilla and then reading out the ancilla projectively. Such a weak measurement ""preserves"" the original qubit, but it disturbs the state, with the back-action being proportional to the amount of retrieved information.
The point they make in the paper is that the post-measurement state is not predictable, but once they know the outcome, they can precisely determine the back-action and feed back a corresponding correction on the initial state.
Importantly, they only performed this measurement on a single qubit, not on an entangled multi-qubit state. That would be much harder, and the remaining entanglement in the state would be reduced by an amount proportional to the measurement strength. Importantly, it would not be as straightforward to get an entangled state back to where it started with the demonstrated feedback method.";0;16jpg5;[]

However, unsurprisingly Nikita Gourianov doesn't properly understand the threat that Shors algorithm posses to global privacy. This is also why he doesn't understand the military interest in the quantum computing. If you go read the original article he says that Shor's algorithm isn't that large a threat since we can just change to other quantum proof encryption schemes. The strategic element Gourianov misses is that we currently use breakable encryption and encrypted data can simply be captured and retained. You don't need to break stolen or captured information today, you can simply hold it until its breakable and retroactively reveal secrets. Nothing done today on the internet will be private unless the data is somehow lost, otherwise it will eventually be cracked. Militaries understand this and know that any stolen encrypted info will be breakable regardless of changes to future encryption.;0;x5d6j2;[]

Neither does it concern rearranging the particles of a macroscopic object to copy the form of another object. *Its distinguishing feature is that it can transmit the information present in a quantum superposition, useful for quantum communication and computation.*";0;c5wwv;[]

Math works because the human brain keeps trying until it finds a pattern that fits.
We're literally making it up as we go along.
Then revising it until it fits closer to what we observe.
Ad infinitum
And yes, this only works *because* there's an underlying pattern to things. And I suppose you can try and imagine a universe that doesn't have an underlying pattern to it, but it would have to keep going like that, without eventually coalescing into *some* kind of pattern. And then, if there are no patterns, it doesn't seem like anybody would be there to observe it. But even chaos is a pattern of its own. Even no pattern is a pattern of sorts.
The whole thing is just a big grand emergent structure, and our math is just the closest description we currently have of it all, made using our extremely limited ability to observe.
It's not *right* per se, and there's nobody checking but us, and there's no way to check but observe. And it's not complete either, nor will it ever be. Thanks Gdel.
The whole thing IS just eating its own tail. We ARE making the whole thing up as we go along. It really doesn't *mean* anything, and it *is* just the most current convenient description.
The whole thing is because it fell out of itself.
The universe is a paradox from the inside.
It is because it is because it is. If it wasn't, it wouldn't.";0;sttmr0;[]

Quantum Key Distribution, QKD, is mathematically proven to be indecipherable. This is *without* making any assumptions on Eve (the attacking eavesdropper), but only a few on Alice and Bob (sender and receiver).
What QKD does is use qubits to create a one-time key to a cypher. This key is created using quantum mechanics (perfectly random) and privacy amplification (shortening the random key using classical cyphers) to create something that cannot be duplicated except by random chance. Once you have your key, you can use that to create a message which is indecipherable.
What that means is that the only way for someone to control what is being sent or received has to physically take over the material sending and receiving the qubits. Why is that? Why is the only way to beat QKD is to physically take over both the sender and receiver? Because of QBER.
QBER is the Quantum Bit Error Rate. It is a number which is more or less unique to each QKD communication line. This is a gross simplification, but it can be understood as the % of times a qubit being sent is modified by the environment. If you have Eve trying to find out what Alice is sending to Bob, she will have to measure the qubits and will end up changing their state. This increases the QBER, which can be detected by both Alice and Bob, and means that they can stop exchanging the key and figure out what is happening.
Since no actual message has been sent, only a key, even if Eve gets any parts of that key, she doesnt actually gain any information since there was no message. Alice and Bob can keep on making new keys until the QBER is at a number which tells them there are no opponents listening in. This method is perfectly unhackable.";0;ny3z76;[]

Second author of the paper here. To clarify a bit: we used weak but faithful quantum measurements to estimate the phase of the oscillation of the qubit, and then used that weak measurement record to condition a feedback signal that locks the quantum oscillation of the qubit to a classical reference. What's really novel about this work is closing a feedback loop on a quantum system.
If you'd like to read the paper, the preprint is available on the arXiv:
There's a nice discussion in fairly simple terms in Nature along with the paper, but behind the Nature paywall:
added a tiny confirmation to our group's web page, under the citation for the paper:

How do you luck into finding two entangled particles such that one isn't already way off on the other side of Pluto where you can do nothing useful with it?

>[Technical procedural stuff.] New observables living in the bulk appear at the quantum level (analogous to spin in quantum mechanics) that are not present at the classical level and are associated with the discrete nature of the spin network states of loop quantum gravity. The resulting quantum space-times resolve the singularity present in the classical theory inside black holes.
[Loop quantum gravity]( is one very, very theoretical alternative to the already very, very theoretical string theory, and to a host of others. It constructs space and time - and matter fields - from a flow of information through an abstract network of spin states, following cellular automata like rules. As these evolve over time - sort of, cf Rovelli and Connes, notion of 'thermal time' a sort of winding down of everything - the ""spin foam"" gives rise to space and the sequence of time. Our world is a lesser projection of this higher reality - the bulk. One of the interesting predictions of the theory (Turok, Bojoworld) is that spacetime (sort of) has a maximum permitted density: the very dense becomes dual with the less dense, reversing things. Thus, singularities are forbidden and cosmic collapses lead to Big Bounces, which also does away with the need for an inflation mechanism. What I think that this paper is claiming is that at sufficient density, the bulk generates stuff ('observables') which amount to different space times. You coudl interpret this as saying that a collapse spawns new universes, or you could not. ";0;1f9ha2;[]

I went to read the paper and began trying to track down the citations that were being used to support their statements and it doesn't look good.
Just in the introduction, we have *Quantum mechanisms are at work in sensory systems feeding the brain with information \[13\]. Foremost in magneto-reception \[4\], there is no doubt that only quantum mechanical effects can explain its sensitivity \[3\].*
Which alone, seems to check out from their source. But the authors try to extend that reasoning with:
*Beyond those sensory inputs, more complex brain functionalities depend on the presence of specific nuclear spins.* Which does not follow. Just because a sensory system utilizes quantum effects, doesn't imply that a system further down the line NECESSARILY uses them as well. I'm sure the birds with quantum-magneto senses also have feet. If I was applying similar logic, I would say that since their feet are connected, they must also have quantum feet. (wheeee) The paper words this in a sneaky way, introducing an irrelevant fact but encouraging the reader to take the presented logical deduction forward.
*For example, Lithium-6 isotopes with nuclear spin 1 increase activity of* *complex behaviour in contrast to Lithium-7 isotopes with 3/2 spin where* *it decreases \[5\]*
The citation mentions a study on rats (which are not human), and indeed uses Li6 and Li7 to observe that Li6 treated mice become helicopter rat moms and Li7 treated mice abandon their children.

No, there is too much. ELI15:
Classical computers store and work with information in binary form. Each unit of information called a bit: either 0 or 1. It can be stored in many forms, like whether electricity is or isn't flowing through a transistor, or magnetic information on a disk drive, or even just 0s and 1s written in pencil on a sheet of paper. What matters is the information itself.
Quantum computers store and work with *qubits*. Each unit of information is _both_ 0 and 1 at the same time, with a certain probability. This can be expressed as a complex number (a real plus imaginary), called the [probability amplitude]( Like a bit, this can be stored in many forms, like the polarization of a photon or the spin of an electron.
However, unlike a classical bit, you _could not_ just ""write down"" a sequence of qubits on a sheet of paper and then recreate them in some other quantum computer. The state of a bit is either 0 or 1; but the state of a qubit is represented by a complex number that could require infinite precision.
But sometimes you do want to move quantum information from one place to another, or transfer it from one computer to another. This is where ""teleportation"" comes in. You use a special trick (details not important right now) that causes a qubit in one location to lose its quantum state while a qubit in a different location gains that state. (If you're curious, this does not transfer information faster than light: in order to finish the process, you have to also transfer two classical bits of information using good old fashioned legwork)
The interesting thing in this article is that the researchers didn't just transfer quantum state from one electron to another, or one photon to another, which has been done regularly. They were able to transfer state from ~~an electron~~ (**Edit**: a photon) to the nuclear spin of an atom, which is much easier to work with and store, and could be used to build quantum computers much more easily. **Edit**: These researchers have also previously transferred quantum state to the nuclear spin of the nitrogen defects in diamonds, but those defects are rare. Now they can transfer onto ^(13)C atoms, which are very abundant in diamonds.";0;c6j2vp;[]

I have a thousand pages of similarly totally clueless researchers receiving one pie-in-the-face after another and blinking like deer caught in the headlights, because their lives have become indistinguishable from lowbrow Vaudeville slapstick and fiction. Take a guess how a physicist would prove that 42 is as good an explanation as any other, because I know how its done. It is the self-evident truth, which expresses equally humble and elegant simplicity, differentials and integrals, as systems logics a five year old can understand once I'm done.
We'll see how proud physicists are when five years olds know more about the subject than they do. Already, physics is hitting the point of diminishing returns, and the lowbrow slapstick is transforming into a landslide beginning with the extremes in the physical and cognitive sciences. Even Hollywood writers could not make this shit up, because its all based on prehistoric potty humor that describes everything and nothing, with some jokes already being classified, ""Vital to the National Defense"". This is one pie-in-the-face that is going to knock everyone right off their feet but, please, feel perfectly free, to just call me an idiot. Its my family tradition to be light on our feet and learn how to bounce and duck, when the crap is about to hit the fan hard!";0;8mkhpv;[]

Sound is just mechanical vibrations in materials. However, these vibrations can be waves, which are called phonons.

This is a widespread misunderstanding of how entanglement works, and problematic because people infer that faster-than-light communication is possible.
Suppose Alice measures particle A and Bob measures particle B; particle A and B are entangled. They can make their measurements very fancy (like the experiment in OP's article) or very simple but what I say below remains unchanged.
From Bob's point of view, the *act* of Alice's measurement changes nothing about his expectation of probabilities when he makes his measurements. It does not matter even if he knows exactly what is her plan of measurement. **There is no way for Bob to detect which type of measurement Alice has made, or even if she has made a measurement at all.** Hence there is no detectable action at a distance. It is only later on, after both Alice and Bob have communicated their measurement results to each other and compared notes, that they notice there is a special type of correlation that is impossible in standard, classical physics. (And note I say correlation, not causation.)

Give it 50-100 years. Sadly, the people who fund this research only want to see results and thus we see overhyped popsci articles like this :P
Edit: The reason I say useless is because of decoherence. Quantum computers are more likely to mess up a computation because qubits are more fragile than classical bits. To do any large scale computation with a quantum computer, you need it to be fault-tolerant. Fault-tolerance requires encoding your qubits into many qubits with quantum error correcting codes. We then will need millions of qubits to do this, along with better control over them than we have now. If I put my money any company investing in this technology, it would not be D-wave, IBM, or google. I think Psi-Quantum has the best chance of doing something sooner. They have the go big or go home approach, focusing all their efforts on making fault-tolerant qubits. Unfortunately, they are pretty secretive about their progress.
Also, I am not appealing to the fallacy that abstract math has no purpose if we dont immediately see its value. In fact, I think everyone in this thread should learn as much as they can about quantum computing. Go and download Nielsen and Chuang or watch some lectures on YouTube.

Something may be quantum in its initial key-signing or whatever, but eventually it will need to hit a router which will have to route the traffic, ergo it ""turns into"" normal packets rather than magical packets. Assuming the router (not hub) knows the secret exclusively you may be okay.
However, such an exercise (which most quantum security experiments are) are merely academic insofar as they are creating a new mechanism to stop MiTM via a more secure key exchange. My gripe with this is we have things like [Elliptic curve DiffieHellman (ECDHE)]( which more or less 'solve' this issue of Alice, Bob, and Eve. So, you have a few issues despite this:
* SSL2/3 implementation sucks -- particularly almost all implementations are way too backwards compatible. That's to say, it's easy to perform a ""downgrade attack"" since the server ""wants"" ECDHE but will accept lower ciphersuites -- or even SSL2.
* Not all SSL certs are created equally, and only [Extended Validation (EV) Certs]( can truly be trusted to not be tampered with. However, browsers like IE can ""fake"" the green status for EV certs...
There's a different between ""for now"" secrecy and what is termed ""perfect forward secrecy"". The NSA is holding on to encrypted traffic should they flag it, and later-on when companies are re-newing their certs they can give them the old certs + private keys to decrypt the old traffic. With ECDHE ciphers this would be more or less useless and force the NSA to decrypt each set of traffic individually.";0;1luenb;[]

The author is right in that there is a big difference between the scale of machines that we have now and of those that will be commercially useful. That's precisely the point - building a large-scale, useful machine is a multi-billion dollar engineering endeavor. It is now outside the scope of national funding bodies without a Los Alamos-sized effort (which is impossible in the current political climate) and we certainly won't get there by incrementally improving the devices we have in academic labs. There are only two options to deliver on the technology in any meaningful timeframe: be an incumbent tech company with deep pockets, or find venture capital.
On the latter, VC's primary job is to understand risk. They aren't ""hoodwinked"" or ""naive"" about quantum computing; they know it's a technology with hurdles to overcome.

> Knig and his colleagues have now conclusively demonstrated the advantage of quantum computers. To this end, they developed a quantum circuit that can solve a specific difficult algebraic problem. The new circuit has a simple structure: it only performs a fixed number of operations on each qubit. Such a circuit is referred to as having a constant depth. In their work, the researchers prove that the problem at hand cannot be solved using classical constant-depth circuits.
This tells you virtually nothing. You can carry out fats, approximate calculations using a nomogram or two elastic bands which require a digital computer to use a linear program or similar. However, one of these has a link to a AAAS Scince article [here](
> We show that parallel quantum algorithms running in a constant time period are strictly more powerful than their classical counterparts; they are provably better at solving certain linear algebra problems associated with binary quadratic forms. Our work gives an unconditional proof of a computational quantum advantage and simultaneously pinpoints its origin: It is a consequence of quantum nonlocality.

There is no sound particle. Sound is a result of other particles colliding. Sound is a wave and only a wave. Comparing sound to photons is very misleading. Photons are particles that also have wave properties. They are both particles and waves. If a photon were just a wave it couldnt travel through a vacuum, if a photon were just a particle it couldnt interfere with other light waves. A sound wave can interfere with other sound waves but it cant travel through a vacuum. Sound is only a wave.
It is sometimes useful to treat very specific types of vibrations as particles mathematically. When you do this you call your particle a quasiparticle. A phonon is a type of quasiparticle that comes from a specific mathematical treatment of vibration. It is true that sound can be caused by vibration.

Yeah, I'm just going to conclude that our brains aren't very good at math.
I mean, isn't it obvious? We don't do math in an efficient way. We process it like we process other stuff, with a huge amount of neurons. We're able to make some abstractions, like remembering that 5+4=4+5, because of the sheer amount of processing power we use while doing simple math.

In the currently accepted expansion model of our universe, a point in ""real-time"" at which there is a singularity is required, which can be a difficult thing to deal with when attempting to discern a ""beginning"" because the laws of physics break down at one. However, to put it simply, imaginary time allows us to avoid this conundrum by visualizing time as just another direction in space, ergo euclidian spacetime, wherein the singularity we saw prior is just another point in 4D spacetime.
The example used in ""A Brief History of Time"" to visualize this is to imagine a sphere with North and South poles, not unlike the earth, with lines of latitude radiating evenly outwards. In this, the North represents the earliest point in imaginary time, and the South the latest, and the size of the latitude lines (which get progressively bigger as you reach the equator of this sphere) represent the size of the universe with respect to this imaginary time. Moving from North to South, we start at a single point (the North Pole) meant to represent a singularity prior to the Big Bang, but instead of our real-time notion of a singularity, in imaginary time, it's just another point. The same thing applies for the South Pole of this model, meant to represent the ""Big Crunch"".

.
**Horgan**: _Krauss, Stephen Hawking and Neil deGrasse Tyson have been bashing philosophy as a waste of time. Do you agree?_
**Ellis**: _If they really believe this they should stop indulging in low-grade philosophy in their own writings. You cannot do physics or cosmology without an assumed philosophical basis. You can choose not to think about that basis: it will still be there as an unexamined foundation of what you do. The fact you are unwilling to examine the philosophical foundations of what you do does not mean those foundations are not there; it just means they are unexamined._
.
Although, that speaker indulges in his own philosophical philistinian rant himself, IMHO:
.
**Horgan**: _Einstein, in the following quote, seemed to doubt free will: If the moon, in the act of completing its eternal way around the Earth, were gifted with self-consciousness, it would feel thoroughly convinced that it was traveling its way of its own accord. So would a Being, endowed with higher insight and more perfect intelligence, watching man and his doings, smile about mans illusion that he was acting according to his own free will. Do you believe in free will?_
**Ellis**: _Yes. Einstein is perpetuating the belief that all causation is bottom up. This simply is not the case, as I can demonstrate with many examples from sociology, neuroscience, physiology, epigenetics, engineering, and physics. Furthermore if Einstein did not have free will in some meaningful sense, then he could not have been responsible for the theory of relativity it would have been a product of lower level processes but not of an intelligent mind choosing between possible options._
_I find it very hard to believe this to be the case indeed it does not seem to make any sense. Physicists should pay attention to Aristotles four forms of causation if they have the free will to decide what they are doing. If they dont, then why waste time talking to them? They are then not responsible for what they say._

Less simple: They used some mirrors with a certain setup that would only allow certain photons through, the one's that do get through come out the same way they came in. When they see one like that they can look at its phase which, because of the mirror bouncing, is flipped. Detecting the phase alone doesn't completely destroy the quantum state though. So basically we're changing two variables the photon has, and by reading one you can infer the other is also different, but because we're not directly reading the other variable, we don't screw with it's quantum state. This doesn't give us the whole ""omg quantum computers"" we wanted but it does mean that we can test a single photon repeatedly before it completely loses its quantum state, which is better than having it collapse on the very first measurement. In order to get what we want, we need to be able to read it without breaking the state at all.";0;1qoox6;[]

Lets say you want to transmit a message over an extremely long distance, light years for example.
The message is a simple Boolean yes or no. One particle is sent with whomever is going to be at the destination, the other stays with you. (And yes, were talking spherical cows in a vacuum style hypothetical.)
So qubit A goes to get lost in space, qubit B stays home.
At some point, you want to send a message to qubit A. So you microwave qubit B until it has the proper orientation. Since A and B are entangled, A must also change to match the change in B, and this is done instantly, potentially far faster than the speed of light, depending on how far A and B are from each other.
So not only does this break the standard model (again hypothetically) but it also implies that the speed of light is not the limit for the transmission of any kind of information or state-change.
How does modern physics deal with a contradiction in terms on this level?";0;vu7s81;[]

> Physics theory used to predict crowd behavior
> Theyve developed a highly accurate mathematical approach to predict the behavior of crowds of living creatures, using Nobel Prize-winning methods originally developed to study large collections of quantum mechanically interacting electrons. Journal Reference:
J. Felipe Mndez-Valderrama, Yunus A. Kinkhabwala, Jeffrey Silver, Itai Cohen, T. A. Arias. Density-functional fluctuation theory of crowds. Nature Communications, 2018; 9 (1) DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05750-z
Link: Abstract
A primary goal of collective population behavior studies is to determine the rules governing crowd distributions in order to predict future behaviors in new environments. Current top-down modeling approaches describe, instead of predict, specific emergent behaviors, whereas bottom-up approaches must postulate, instead of directly determine, rules for individual behaviors. Here, we employ classical density functional theory (DFT) to quantify, directly from observations of local crowd density, the rules that predict mass behaviors under new circumstances. To demonstrate our theory-based, data-driven approach, we use a model crowd consisting of walking fruit flies and extract two functions that separately describe spatial and social preferences. The resulting theory accurately predicts experimental fly distributions in new environments and provides quantification of the crowd mood. Should this approach generalize beyond milling crowds, it may find powerful applications in fields ranging from spatial ecology and active matter to demography and economics.

Every Bitcoin transaction is assigned a cryptographic key, which is vulnerable for a finite time, which might vary from 10 minutes to an hour, to a day. The researchers estimate that a quantum computer with 1.9 billion qubits would be necessary to crack a Bitcoin's encryption within 10 minutes.

Let's say you took one of those diamonds on a really high speed trip - enough so that relative time was allowed to change between the two... The one on the trip aging slower, of course... If brought back to earth, would they still hold the entanglement - or could there possibly be a delay? Would/could the time dilated diamond perhaps be slow in its entanglement effects? Has this been tried before? *Edit*: I am not after FTL communications, time machines, or the like - I am mostly just curious if the slowing of time/age of a particular diamond by means of relativistic travel would actually *slow down* the quantum entanglement of the set. It would actually end up being the opposite of FTL - but the thought experiment could have the potential of showing/hinting at what the entanglement really is... eg- if it is resistant to relativity, why? and the opposite..;0;mwole;[]

The article's implied relationship between quantum teleportation and entanglement is a bit deceptive.
The which-shoe-did-you-leave-at-the-store analogy is a good one, but note that it doesn't allow you to transmit new information back to the store. E.g. if you later make a yes/no decision on whether to have fish for dinner, there's no way of using the process of discovering which shoe is in the box and which remains back at the store to transmit this decision back to the store.
Next, quantum teleportation doesn't use entanglement in this way. It uses vector bosons, e.g. photons, to reproduce the quantum state of one particle in another. These travel at the speed of light (for photons) or more slowly (other vector bosons which have mass) so the technique is important for implementing something like a quantum computer, which requires something like this to move information from place to place.
This is all pretty nifty, mind you, but I noticed in some replies people succumbing to the same confusion the science writer did. (The original article is clearer, sort of, but a lot more difficult to read.)
It's also worth noting that quantum entanglement *does* give us a noteworthy and useful gift: encryption. It can be used to transmit a crypto key from one place to another in a way which makes it immediately obvious that someone has eavesdropped on the key exchange. Take **that**, Blackburn and Graham!";0;hgu2j0;[]

That means that a *pure* quantum computer wouldnt be able to do most stuff a normal general-purpose computer can; it can do specific things (e.g., Shors Algorithm to factor numbers) much faster than a conventional computer. QC algorithms (usually) also give you an answer with some probability of that answer being correct, so youll have to repeat that algorithm an arbitrary number of times until youre reasonably sure youve got the right answer, though its not certain. In contrast, although a general-purpose computer can run probabilistic algorithms that work this way (e.g., this number probably isnt prime), most algorithms give you an answer that, assuming everythings programmed and functioning properly, is definitely right.
What this all means is that youre not going to have a quantum computer just lying around running Windows; the QC part of the machine is going to be attached as an accelerator chip/card/peripheral, like you would with a GPU, or *maybe* as a one-off extension to the CPU like the RNG that drives x86 RDRAND instructions. (The extra-instruction approach is unlikely IMO due to the fact that information on the quantum side of things would have to be collapsed in order to shuffle it over to the CPU, which means its state is near-totally separate from the normal CPU state except when taking input or giving final output.) If QC is done via accelerator, the CPU would line stuff up in RAM and poke the QPU, which would then use that to come up with a possible-answer, shove it back into RAM, and poke the CPU when done. The CPU itself isnt any faster, and neither is running anything not specifically targeted to the QPU. Moreover, different algorithms would get different kinds of speedup depending on how and how much they use the QPU.
In short, comparing the speed of a general-purpose+QC beast vs. a normal computer is like comparing apples and shoes-per-second unless you have a very specific algorithm and implementation in mind.";0;5xt03g;[]

But the quantum computers we have now are error-prone and don't have enough qubits to allow for error correction. The only demonstrations we've had involve quantum computing hardware evolving out of a random configuration and traditional computers failing to simulate their normal behavior. Useful calculations are an exercise for the future.
But a new paper from Google's quantum computing group has now moved beyond these sorts of demonstrations and used a quantum computer as part of a system that can help us understand quantum systems in general, rather than the quantum computer. And they show that, even on today's error-prone hardware, the system can outperform classical computers on the same problem.";0;v9wj42;[]

My understanding of what will be possible with superposition based hashing is that a 256qbit processor could solve/find a bitcoin block ""instantly"" ( instantly = 1 plank second ). This is of course the theoretical limit as electronic communication to and from the processor is the liability. Regardless of the difficulty algorithm adjustments that take place after each block is mined, a 256qbit processor will mine every unmined bitcoin left in less than 1 full second. This will also lead to an absurd level of difficulty so that the rest of the mining pool wouldnt be able to solve a block for millions of years. Proof of work is kind of whooptydo anyway, the value was in the consensus and the consensus is something that a qbit processor, itself, cant do anything about. However, a qbit based decryptor could decrypt your keys very easily. So if someone had one and looked at your on-chain transactions with it, they could fool the consensus into allowing them to make transactions for you simply by using your keys. But your data provider could already do this; if you've ever sent any crypto, even the private ones like monero, across a data provider like At&t then they have had access to your personal data, even if it was encrypted, this whole time and couldve transacted, on-chain, on your behalf. The qbit processor just speeds up what can already be done. Qbit computation is really powerful but the true value of quantum tech in terms of blockchains and financial ecosystems will be the properties of quantum entanglement and the ability to transmit data across any space instantly. We are literally talking about the emergence of a galactic economy that uses qbit encrypted blockchain based currencies, but can you imagine using the same currency a light year away while using a communication method that transmits through light? No, the lag time over the value of the currency would make such things prohibitive up until we make the consensus and communication mechanisms instantaneous. Eventually when we migrate to mars or the asteroid belt, we simply will not tolerate the volatility inherent to a multi-minute lag time inherent to the speed of light; quantum entanglement based communication rails and consensus algorithms will be required before then.";0;ipn127;[]

>During their early attempts to simplify and generalize what MELVIN had found, Krenn and his colleagues realized that the solution resembled abstract mathematical forms called graphs, which contain vertices and edges and are used to depict pairwise relations between objects. For these quantum experiments, every path a photon takes is represented by a vertex. And a crystal, for example, is represented by an edge connecting two vertices. MELVIN first produced such a graph and then performed a mathematical operation on it. The operation, called perfect matching, involves generating an equivalent graph in which each vertex is connected to only one edge. This process makes calculating the final quantum state much easier, although it is still hard for humans to understand. > >That changed with MELVINs successor THESEUS, which generates much simpler graphs by winnowing the first complex graph representing a solution that it finds down to the bare minimum number of edges and vertices (such that any further deletion destroys the setups ability to generate the desired quantum states). Such graphs are simpler than MELVINs perfect matching graphs, so it is even easier to make sense of any AI-generated solution.";0;of897k;[]

Philosophy trumps science, because it preceeds science and works at a more fundamental level.

&#x200B;
As a few people have pointed out I did not explain the second part of the double slit experiment. So here goes. In every experiment that has been carried out where the experimenter tries to determine which slit the photon passes through the interference that is already present on the screen is disrupted and the pattern that emerges is more like a smudging of particle detections spread out symmetrically from the center line of the detector screen with more particle detections closer to the centerline. In the case of the quantum eraser experiments as the photon continues along its path after the path has been determined another optical element takes away the which path information and as if by magic the interference pattern (multiple bands) reappears. So what the hell is going on then? How can that happen? Like I said at the beginning of my original comment all of this (wave-particle duality, where did the inteference patten go?, quantum eraser, observation) are all consequences of the uncertainty relationships (basically not being able to measure precisely where the particle is).
&#x200B;
Lets clear up whats happening when people talk about observing in relation to the double slit experiment. Bohr provided the solution to why the interference pattern disapperars when the experimenter attempts to probe the experiment and determine which slit the photon went through (This was during the Bohr-Einstein debates, possibly the reddit of its day, years and years ago, although back then it was called The Solvay conferences :D). So back to the explaination. In order to detect which slit the photon goes through any sort of device (microscope, laser, another much smaller detector screen, etc) must by its very nature use another particle to gain information about the photon. This other particle will impart whats called a momentum kick. Its like when youre playing pool (aka billards) or snooker and the white ball hits another colored ball. The white ball (depending on the initial conditions and they can be adjusted to get the desired result) will stop thus indicating some information about the other ball such as location or velocity. However a consequence of hitting that coloured ball is that its momentum has now changed. This is basically a momentum kick and something quite similar happens with the photons and the probing particle. Now it turns out (and this has been verified experimenatlly over and over by many different experiments) that the least amount of momentum required by the probing particle to obtain sufficient information to definintely say which slit it went through exceeds the limit defined in the uncertainty relationship for keeping the interfreence pattern intact or coherent.
&#x200B;
What is this uncertainty relationship? Well this is it. \[ deltaP x deltaQ > or = 0.5 hbar \]. Now ""deltaP"" is the uncertainty in momentum and ""delatQ"" is the uncertainty in position (the deltas mean really really small). hbar is also a really really small number (Plancks constant divided by 2pie). What the uncertainty relation is saying is, that if you multiply the uncertainties in postion and momentum by each other for the photon that you want to obtain information from, as long as the uncertainties when multiplied togteher are bigger than 0.5 times hbar, then the interference pattern will remain intact. However, the least amount of momentum for the probing particle you can use to get a sensible answer for the location of the photon changes the uncertainty in momentum by an amount such that on multiplying by the unceratinty in position the number that should be bigger than 0.5 times hbar for the interference pattern to remain intact now becomes smaller than 0.5 hbar and so the interference pattern is disrupted. But wait? What happend to the probabilty distributions I was taliking about earlier that define the interence pattern. Well another name for those uncertainties is standard deviation and the standard deviation is all you need to know to compare different probabilty distributions. The interference pattern is the probabilty distribution for the location. However it is connected to the probability distribution for the momentum by way of the uncertainty relation so a change in the momentum probability distribution will affect the location probability distribution. In the case of the probing particle the change is enough to affect the coherencnce of both distributions (deltaP X deltaQ < 0.5 hbar) and disrupt the interference pattern in both. And that is why the interference pattern turns into a smudge.
&#x200B;
But how does the interference pattern come back in those quantum erasure experiments? Well to answer that we need to know about the work of Berge Englert. He came to realise that in these double slit wave particle situations you can define quantities specifcally for the wave (interference) part and the particle (which way) part all derived from the uncertainty relations. Essentially he found you could define the wave interference by whats called the phase of the wave (the phase is a number that tells you how much out of step the two waves are in relation to each other). He called this quantity V for the visibility of the interference bands. Now for the particle part they used a measure of intensity which is the number of particles hitting the screen according to the location proabability distribution. He called this quantity D for path distinguishability. And then he found another inequality that related D and V. So there was a limit on how much of D you could have in relation to V. And that relationship is this D\^2 + V\^2 < or = 1.
&#x200B;
Now if this looks a bit frightening let me put your mind at rest. Remember Pythagoruss theorem? X\^2 + Y\^2 = Z\^2 for one of those 90 degree triangles. Its the same thing with D\^2 + V\^2 =1. Well now imagine a circle with a radius thats just the number 1. For the sake of simplicty imagine a line drawn along the radius from the center so that it crosse the circle boundary. kinda like this (\\ ). Now if you drop a vertical line from where the radius line crosses the circumference like this (|\\ then you have another right angled triangle |\_\\ where D\^2 + V\^2=1. (D is the horizontal line and V is the vertical line). Now depending on the angle of the radius ,D < V, D= V or D>V or D=1 and V=0 or D=0 and V=1. So guess what? That D=0 and V=1 case describes the situation where you get the interference pattern, the D=1 and V=0 case describes the situation with the smudged intensity pattern and the other ones describe intermdeiate situations where there is partial interference and partial smuding which has also been observed in countless experiements. The quantum erasure sitaution corresponds to a half rotaion of the circle defined by that D, V inequality. The rotation is achieved using the optical elements in the quantum erasure interferometer set up.
&#x200B;
Also a quarter rotation of the circle corresponds to the interference pattern transitioning to the smudge intensity pattern. Now this shows that there is no collapse of the wavefunction. By adjusting the set up the probability distribution for location of the photon transitions to a different probability distribution for location. That smudged out pattern is actually two slightly overlapping Bell shaped distributions but its still a probabilty distribution which means there is no so called collapse. There is no observation either. Yes a particle is used to indicate where the photon was but this actually changes the probability distribution for where the particle is going end up. So while some information is gained about where the photon was it has no influence on where it will eventually be detected on the screen. The ""collapse of the wave function"" is an interpretation of what could be happening much like the many worlds, etc. But they are just interpretations. And do not represent what is predicted by quantum mechanics. Also while there is no ""collapse of the wave function"" there is a process that occurs when an excited state in a 2 level system interacts with the Environment often modelled as the infinite sum of harmonic field modes. The excited state will lose energy in the form of a photon to one of the Environment's field modes thereby decaying into the ground state. This may have been confused with wave function collapse. Pure states will also decohere to a mixed state over time meaning the off diagonal elements known as coherences will vanish leaving the density matrix in the form of a classical probability distribution. This may also have been misinterpreted as wave function collapse.
&#x200B;
Now the delayed choice quantum eraser. The entangled photons mean that there are now two of those circles (representing both photons) like I described in the last paragraph. So with one circle you have (D1, V1)=(0,1) which is the interference pattern and in the other circle you have (D2,V2)=(1,0) which is the smudged out pattern. So the entanglement means the 2 two type of patterrns (interference and smudged) are correlated and theres a particular probability for that correlation. And depending on the way you can adjust parameters in the optical set up using the different branches on the multiple interforemters in the experiment the (D1, V1)=(cos(theta1), sin(theta1)) and (D2, V2)=(cos(theta2), sin(theta2)) become correlated according to the relative angle (theta1-theta2) thereby showing that there is a range of probabilities for correlated interference patterns (including partial and full) to occur depending on which photons are detected.

Important considerations from the article.
>Scientists from Trinity College Dublin believe our brains could use quantum computation. Their discovery comes after they adapted an idea developed to prove the existence of quantum gravity to explore the human brain and its workings.
>The brain functions measured were also correlated to short-term memory performance and conscious awareness, suggesting quantum processes are also part of cognitive and conscious brain functions.
And.
>""Because these brain functions were also correlated to short-term memory performance and conscious awareness, it is likely that those quantum processes are an important part of our cognitive and conscious brain functions.
>""Quantum brain processes could explain why we can still outperform supercomputers when it comes to unforeseen circumstances, decision making, or learning something new. Our experiments, performed only 50 meters away from the lecture theater where Schrdinger presented his famous thoughts about life, may shed light on the mysteries of biology, and on consciousness which scientifically is even harder to grasp.""

> The aim of this study was to show that the brain is non-classical. We assumed that unknown brain functions exist which can mediate entanglement between auxiliary quantum systems. The experimental detection of such an entanglement created by the brain would then be sufficient to prove cerebral non-classicality. We found experimental evidence that such entanglement creation occurs as part of physiological and cognitive processes. We argued that the ZQC signals were non-local because (a) ZQC signals were above the classical bound, and (b) the signals had no SQC and MQC correlates. Further, we could confirm that the signals were only detectable in combination with reduced classical signals (necessary condition), and that they resembled HEPs which are below verifiability in conventional MRI (sufficient condition). Our findings may disapprove the statement that quantum entanglement or coherence can't survive in the hot and wet environment of the brain. Beyond the fundamental question we tried to answer here, we found an undiscovered NMR contrast, which can detect brain activity beyond conventional functional MRI.

This paper was rumored for a while, and a [leaked version briefly made its way online.](
Edit: There have been a lot of great questions in the comments. Let me try to answer some of them in bulk paraphrase. (For some of the more technical questions, I'm in touch with our physics reporter, Emily Conover, but she's got her hands full today.)
Q: Will this affect my internet/gaming/etc. experience?
A: Not for a very long time, barring some huge, unforeseen breakthrough.
Q: But didn't IBM call BS on this?
A: Pretty much, yes. We address that in the article. IBM claims a classical supercomputer can do this in 2.5 days, not the 10,000 years Google claims, but IBM also hasn't done this calculation. And even so, the gap between 2.5 days with the world's most powerful supercomputer and 200 seconds with an experimental quantum computer is pretty big.
Q: If this isn't practically applicable, why is it important?
A: A lot of things start off as generally not relevant to consumers. Until one day, they suddenly are VERY relevant. Also, science is a process, and this is a big milestone, even if you take IBM's side in this debate.
Q: ELI5?
A: Oh crap, I'm not a quantum physicist. I'll defer to this article Emily wrote in 2017 which [explains the coming rise in quantum computing]( (edit: This article would normally be behind a paywall, but I lifted it for y'all!). It's not a short article, but you kinda can't do this subject justice in short form. But to make a very long, very complicated story very short and oversimplified, quantum computers rely on 'qubits' where classical computers (including the kind you use on a daily basis, and supercomputers that you probably don't use) rely on bits. Bits can be either 0 or 1. Qubits can be either 0, 1 or a superposition of both. Using those qubits in very complicated ways (again, I am not a physicist), quantum computers have the potential to solve problems that classical computers can't ever achieve, or can't achieve without thousands of years of effort. It's still very far down the road, but the implications are potentially enormous.
Edit 2: Q: But crypto??
A: This computer did *one very specific thing* that takes classical computers a long time to do. This doesn't automatically invalidate standard encryption or blockchain practices. Now, is that a thing that might happen eventually with more powerful quantum computers of the future? Time will tell.";0;dlwaxv;[]

So they start to measure A and lets say it points ""up"". Then they just wait and see how long it takes for B to start pointing ""down""? What state does B have before its buddy's ""signal"" reaches it? Can you even measure it? Could it be pointing ""left"" for a while?

Alright so you can't change the state, but can you change the time when A is measured? If you could, couldn't this be used exactly as morse code? Measure A at 0:00 B at 0:10 C at 0:30. Wouldn't they then show up at the other end in this order and with the same intervals?

It's also worth pointing out that there are good reasons its a minority research program: any would-be theory of quantum gravity that can't verifiably reproduce general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits really hasn't succeeded in satisfying the first criteria to be taken seriously as a viable contender, and LQG doesn't fulfil either of these requirements.
Anyway as for whether Philosophical Superficiality has harmed physics, I don't think he's said anything remotely convincing on the subject. Everything he says in this paragraph pretty much boils down to the fact that he wishes more researchers would choose his research program, and so he thinks that if theorists were just thinking more deeply or more philosophically, then more of them might agree with him (a dubious notion if you ask me).
So all in all, the link really doesn't contain much of anything meaningful about philosophy. It's more an attempt to invoke philosophy to argue for ideas that otherwise haven't convinced the theoretical physics community.";0;2e9qe8;[]

1. This doesn't mean we can measure the state of the qubit without collapsing it: this is mathematically impossible because of the no-cloning theorem. If it was violated we would have to redo all of quantum physics.
2. This doesn't mean that different kinds of quantum computing are possible, it's making one form of quantum error correction more viable. The title is absolutely misleading and we cannot ""observe quantum information while preserving its integrity.""
3. This doesn't break quantum encryption since you're not monitoring the qubit before it's sent to you in order to detect a change; if you could, you could simply see what orientation the qubit was and break it anyways.
4. A qubit doesn't store x amount of information. The most information a single qubit can store is 1 bit, since it can only be measured to be 1 or 0. If, however, we are assuming we could look right at a qubit without disturbing it, it would store an infinitude of information since the state can be defined by 3 real parameters (the complex amplitudes of the 1 and 0 states can be parametrized by 3 real variables.) I saw something in this thread that was upvoted suggesting it could store a only finitely many bits of information if you could view the state. It could ""store"" much more if this was possible, but it's not.
5. This is only useful insofar as it improves the fidelity of quantum operations and makes standard quantum error correction strong enough to enable an arbitrarily large quantum computer. In fact, all quantum error correction circuits rely on the ability to measure deviations due to the environment in one or a few of the qubits and then correct those qubits.

A causes B causes A because the possibilities are superpositioned until the spirit world ""chooses"" an outcome by observing the desired result.

After the first confirmed extrasolar planet was proven, other planet hunters went back through their data using the new findings and discovered to their chagrin that they, in fact, had found identical data on numerous ES planets beforehand but simply didn't apply the proper imagination to know what they were seeing.
I'm probably screwing this up, but I seem to remember most planet hunters were looking for planets like Jupiter in our own solar system...massive planets a decent distance from their home star that would make the star's wobble fairly easy to detect. However, the first planet confirmed (and, bizarrely compared to ""accepted wisdom"" of solar system formation at the time) was indeed incredibly large but was far closer to its host star than even Mercury is to our own.
It may well be that when the question is finally answered as to the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations...and don't forget that's really what we're looking for. We may well find extraterrestrial life in our own solar system (such as in the vast, ancient oceans of Europa, etc.) but it's advanced life, like our own species that can create a civilization that can even be detected, period, we're really looking for.
It may well be that when the \*\*first\*\* truly verifiable, traceable, reproducible extra terrestrial civilization is discovered, what we learn from it may well show us many more we had already found and just didn't realize them for what they were because they weren't what we were initially expecting.";0;vumwlv;[]

Can we observe or interact with any of these infinite universes? If not, why care? If so, wouldn't that mean some form of energy or matter is being passed through from that universe from there's to ours? If there is a minute amount of energy being transferred from an infinite number of universes, wouldn't that mean an infinite amount of energy is being transferred? That doesnt sound healthy for our universe.
Perhaps there is a force of balance that we will have to discover or invent for convenience. How about as energy comes in, energy leaves? It could work like water running into a sink with the plug out, though I think an infinite amount of energy pouring in would still be bad for our universe. Maybe we cannot interact with all those infinite universes, like some sort of beehive, we can only interact with the neighbouring universes, though why would such a physical construct exist? Or perhaps we invent an all-powerful being that keeps it all in check?";0;dlvjor;[]

From the above linked article:
>What they showed is that their computer can solve this random circuit sampling problem in about two hundred seconds. And the most powerful classical computer in the world, which is called Summit. Well, Google estimated it would take that computer 10,000 years to solve the same problem that their computer solved in 200 seconds.
TLDR: It took Google's quantum computer .0000006% of the time that it would take Summit to solve the same problem.";0;hx77l9;[]

In the text of the article we find that the scientists were able to gather *partial* information on the photons ""without *completely* destroying it"" (emphasis added by me).
This means that the scientists were able to gather *partial* information on the photon at the cost of *partially* collapsing its quantum state. This is not a new idea and **in no way changes our understanding of quantum mechanics.**
Now at the same time the subtitle of the article reads
""Technique to sense particles *without changing their quantum states* holds promise for quantum networks.""
which is plain false. The quantum states are changed, just not as dramatically as if they had measured complete information on the state.
Similarly the title of this thread says that the scientists ""have now devised a way to detect single photons of visible light without changing *any* of the information that they carry."" Again this is completely false.
Quantum theory predicts that the degree to which a quantum state changes is directly related to how much information you gain about it, so while what these scientists did has practical importance it should not be branded as if they did something previously thought to be impossible.

A team of physicists say they managed to create a new phase of matter by shooting laser pulses reading out the Fibonacci sequence to a quantum computer in Colorado. The matter phase relies on a quirk of the Fibonacci sequence to remain in a quantum state for longer.
Just as ordinary matter can be in a solid, liquid, gas, or superheated plasmic phase (or state), quantum materials also have phases. The phase refers to how the matter is structured on an atomic levelthe arrangement of its atoms or its electrons, for example. Several years ago, physicists discovered a quantum supersolid, and last year, a team confirmed the existence of quantum spin liquids, a long-suspected phase of quantum matter, in a simulator. The recent team thinks theyve discovered another new phase.
Quantum bits, or qubits, are like ordinary computer bits in that their values can be 0 or 1, but they can also be 0 or 1 simultaneously, a state of ambiguity that allows the computers to consider many possible solutions to a problem much faster than an ordinary computer. Quantum computers should eventually be able to solve problems that classical computer cant.
Qubits are often atoms; in the recent case, the researchers used 10 ytterbium ions, which were controlled by electric fields and manipulated using laser pulses. When multiple qubits states can be described in relation to one another, the qubits are considered entangled. Quantum entanglement is a delicate agreement between multiple qubits in a system, and the agreement is dissolved the moment any one of those bits values is certain. At that moment, the system decoheres, and the quantum operation falls apart.
A big challenge of quantum computing is maintaining the quantum state of qubits. The slightest fluctuations in temperature, vibrations, or electromagnetic fields can cause the supersensitive qubits to decohere and their calculations to fall apart. Since the longer the qubits stay quantum, the more you can get done, making computers quantum states persist for as long as possible is a crucial step for the field.
In the recent research, pulsing a laser periodically at the 10 ytterbium qubits kept them in a quantum statemeaning entangledfor 1.5 seconds. But when the researchers pulsed the lasers in the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence, they found that the qubits on the edge of the system remained in a quantum state for about 5.5 seconds, the entire length of the experiment (the qubits could have remained in a quantum state for longer, but the team ended the experiment at the 5.5-second mark). Their research was published this summer in Nature.
You can think of the Fibonacci sequence laser pulses as two frequencies that never overlap. That makes the pulses a quasicrystal: a pattern that has order, but no periodicity.
The key result in my mind was showing the difference between these two different ways to engineer these quantum states and how one was better at protecting it from errors than the other, said study co-author Justin Bohnet, a quantum engineer at Quantinuum, the company whose computer was used in the recent experiment.
The Fibonacci sequence is a numeric pattern in which each number is the sum of the two previous numbers (so 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). Its history goes back over 2,000 years and is connected to the so-called golden ratio. Now, the unique series may have quantum implications.
It turns out that if you engineer laser pulses in the correct way, your quantum system can have symmetries that come from time translation, said Philipp Dumitrescu, the papers lead author and a quantum physicist who conducted the work while at the Flatiron Institute. A time-translation symmetry means that an experiment will yield the same result, regardless of whether it takes place today, tomorrow, or 100 years from now.
What we realized is that by using quasi-periodic sequences based on the Fibonacci pattern, you can have the system behave as if there are two distinct directions of time, Dumitrescu added.
Shooting the qubits with laser pulses with a periodic (a simple A-B-A-B) pattern didnt prolong the systems quantum state. But by pulsing the laser in a Fibonacci sequence (A-AB-ABA-ABAAB, and so on), the researchers gave the qubits a non-repeating, or quasi-periodic, pattern.
Its similar to the quasicrystals from the Trinity nuclear test site, but instead of being a three-dimensional quasicrystal, the physicists made a quasicrystal in time. In both cases, symmetries that exist at higher dimensions can be projected in a lower dimension, like the tessellated patterns in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling.
With this quasi-periodic sequence, theres a complicated evolution that cancels out all the errors that live on the edge, Dumitrescu said in a Simons Foundation release. By on the edge, hes referring to the qubits farthest from the center of their configuration at any one time. Because of that, the edge stays quantum-mechanically coherent much, much longer than youd expect. The Fibonacci-pattern laser pulses made the edge qubits more robust.
More robust, longer-lived quantum systems are a vital need for the future of quantum computing. If it takes shooting qubits with a very specific mathematical rhythm of laser pulses to keep a quantum computer in an entangled state, then physicists had better start blasting.";0;y8unmi;[]

This sounds like a *horrible* outcome for space travel. Humans need to carry an ecosystem with them; machines wear out and break down. Why would we intentionally remove the time dilation advantage of relativistic travel?

To put it in simple terms, the problem we have in Quantum Communication is that we cannot use light amplifiers to regain our signal loss due to the no cloning theorem in quantum mechanics. Therefore we need to find another way to transmit our info to farther limits. Quantum memory has been a solution since it would allow us to store a photon and retrieve it later on at a certain desired time. Unfortunately many fundamental problems are still unsolved despite the progress.
As for those who wonder what entanglement is. Imagine you have two objects that can either give you a value of 1 or 0. If they are entangled, then you can take those objects as far from each other as possible and if one is measured with a value of 0, then the other will also take the value of 0 when it will be measured. That way, entanglement provide a certain transportation of the data.
The idea here is to neither use entanglement nor quantum memories. In my opinion it's a bright idea and after reading the paper, definitely deserves a nature photonics";0;14ubs8;[]

I think I saw one other person mention that computers operate completely based on logic gates.. I don't think I saw anyone else mention that computing is still based on eletromagnetism.
There is no sorcery going on here that makes the quibit 1 and 0 at the same time. The bit is simply held in a neutral state until the computer needs it to be a 1 or a 0, instead of functioning like a switch that is either on or off like a transistor.
What does this mean for computing? Exponential calculations will be far easier, but classical computing will largely not change, nor can it change.
Most if not all of our logic gates rely on a bit being set to either 1 or a 0, and we have millions and millions of them, versus a handful of quibits.
That video explains quantum computing and it's limitations best in my opinion.";0;22p527;[]

Also I was able to talk to some cryptographers about the expectations. First - google's project is explicitly not targetting ""breaking crypto"", but of course you can tell from Google's projects (SHAttering.io) etc. that they do look to advance the strength of crypto, and will use very expensive public demonstrations to motivate the industry. At the time of RWC'17 (january) they had about 9 qubits operating.
Also the presenter provided an explanation for what they mean by ""Quantum Supremacy"", which they hoped to achieve last year. What they mean is to be able to do at least one task, any task, faster and more efficiently than a classic CMOS computer. When he explained this, there was an audible groan in the audience and follow up questions begging that the phrase not be misconstrued in the press. The press release covers this, it will be interesting (but really, unsurprising if not) if the press manages not to blow it out of proportion.
That said, quantum computing is coming and will likely be put to cryptographic tasks faster than is publicly acknowledged. It's possible government research (US, China, Russia, etc) are a few years ahead of publicly acknowledged capabilities. From a Cryptography engineering perspective, this means making sure we can flex to new requirements and capabilities, the [NIST Post Quantum Cryptography]( (non) competition is the defensive thing to watch. Right now though there are a lot of other things to work on to defend against classic threats, like preventing key compromise through breach, theft or leak...

It's a classical AI were humans design the search algorithm to solve the problem. In modern machine learning a classical search protocol designed by humans is instead used to search for the AI itself that best solves the problem. This enables the AI to ""understand"" patterns about the problem that reaches beyond human understanding and is far more powerful than classical methods. AlphaGo is an example of modern AI, while classical (search) algorithms could only beat humans in chess.
Edit: Modern (deep learning based) AI can be used to solved a larger scope of problems without human designed heuristics and are considered more powerful because they are far more generalisable and flexible. Additionally, they are more powerful because they learn directly from the data itself and are therefore not constrained by the human understanding of the data. However, when data is lacking, classical methods might be better suited.";0;oeprki;[]

>>We're dealing with the very first steps of modelling reality, and Google says we could start to see applications in all kinds of systems involving chemistry: improved batteries, flexible electronics, new types of materials, and more.
>>One potential use is modelling the way bacteria produce fertiliser. The way humans produce fertiliser is extremely inefficient in terms of the environment, and costs 1-2 percent of the world's energy per year so any improvements in understanding the chemical reactions involved could produce massive gains.
Among the many exciting things here, I'm especially excited about the potential for battery breakthroughs.
Now that solar power is operating under its own Moore's Law of constantly increasing in efficiency and decreasing in price and is over taking fossil fuels, the last piece of the jigsaw here is battery tech to enable us to truly make efficient use of renewable energy.

>Scientists have made a major breakthrough in quantum teleportation, successfully transferring something far more complex than ever before.
>Quantum teleportation is a still mysterious phenomena that can see information flung across space.
>The effect is not the same as the teleportation often seen in science fiction where matter is moved through space but instead is the transfer information about the quantum state of a particle. It could have huge and unimagined effects on the way we organise and transmit information, including the possibility of a vastly more complicated quantum internet.
>Until now, scientists have only been able to teleport quantum bits, or qubits. Those are the simplest possible piece of quantum information, where a particle can be in two states at once.
>But a qutrit which scientists have now successfully teleported adds a whole extra dimension. If a qubit is polarised in two ways at once, a qutrit is polarised in three directions a vastly more complicated unit, and a far greater challenge for the scientists involved.

>It means, in effect, that scientists have more detailed information that can be teleported. A qubit could be 0 or 1; a qutrit can be 0, 1 or 2.
>Sending a qutrit rather than a qubit means a vast increase in complexity, because of the nature of the process.

But it also means that the effect could be far more useful. The extra information that can be transferred could power technologies such as a possible quantum internet, allowing for instant and very secure communication. >The higher the dimensions of your quantum system, the more secure you can ensure your communication is and the more information you can encode, Ciarn Lee, from University College London, told New Scientist. But going from a qubit to a qutrit is especially difficult the tricks you use for qubits have to do with a nice symmetry that qutrits dont have.
>The researchers report in their new paper, published in Physical Review Letters, that the demonstrations of their technique had a 75 per cent fidelity. That may appear low, but is far better than similar techniques that do not use quantum entanglement and is likely to improve in time.";0;cu4f6x;[]

Even tho we've been playing around with quantum theories for years, I don't recall hearing about any tech that actually uses any of these properties, but that's because they haven't figured it all out yet, right?
Anybody else remember the double slit experiment that was supposed to retroactively yield a different result depending on whether or not someone watched a recording of it later?
I'm no quantum expert, but if someone says that something is in a ""superposition"", (indefinite state,) until you measure it, I think, ""well, how do you *know* what its doing if *you haven't measured it yet?*""
I think we're still buggering badgers here folks... There's some step or function the researchers are missing or making assumptions about that makes it seem like the quarks are breaking time/speed limits, but from what it sounds like, each half of the entangled sets are simply being attuned to a complimentary frequency. I can even illustrate what I'm talking about better than I've ever seen the supposed spooky action explained.
Take two disks, (wheels, chocolate chip cookies, whatever,) and put them on an axle. Now, mark each disk, one on top and one on bottom. Now spin the axle. No matter how far apart the disks are moved, if you don't interfere with their spin, or shift the axle you can hide one and whenever you stop the other you'll know exactly what position the other wheel is in. In the case of quantum particles the axle would be *time*, once your partcles are ""entangled"", (I'd say ""synchronized"" sounds more likely,) unless you induce an EM charge or particle bombardment or time dilation effect, your synchronised particles should behave exactly as described. Spinning in unison until something breaks the harmony.

To get to the heart of the matter:
> The natural question is whether 'non-causal' quantum correlations of the kind described by our formalism can be found in nature. One can speculate that they may exist in unprobed physical regimes, such as, for example, those in which quantum mechanics and general relativity become relevant. Indeed, our result that classical theories can always be understood in terms of a global causal structure suggests the possibility that the observed causal order of space-time might not be a fundamental property of nature but rather emerge from a more fundamental theory.
So, they didn't *actually* find correlations that defied causality. They found a way with fancy maths to come up with *potential* correlations that would defy causality. Whether or not those correlations *actually exist* is unknown.

The more we understand quantum mechanics the avenues of technology we can explore are going to be profound.

If quantum computing is proven to be possible then we can start taking bigger and faster steps toward developing a quantum computer that will change our lives as we know it. Advancements in quantum computing isn't progressive. We are trying to solve a problem that may very well be impossible. Breakthroughs like this may someday lead us to the correct method for developing a quantum computer.

Not enough of the latter and it just becomes trivial and not appreciated. Too much of both and we have gems like ""*beating a million times faster than a human heart*"". Calibrating your explanation to your article's intended audience becomes almost like an art.
Someone probably need to correct me on the finer points but the key thing of this paper is that they observe fairly directly, in real space, the wavefunctions of a macroscopic object (the quantum fluid).
But, you said, don't we already see quantum mechanics with naked eyes? The famous double-slit experiment of course. That's true, but it's not a macroscopic quantum state that you see. They're single photons. This here is a big deal because now you can see, *with naked eyes*, a wavefunction of a *big* object.
""Pics or it didn't happen"", you said. But they *do* have pics. It's in Fig.3 in their [paper]( ! They captured it with a CCD, a digital camera practically. That is almost like naked eyes. It also means that there are *videos*! Maybe with poor frame rate but if you can take pictures then you have videos.
So there you have it. If your mind still feels unsatisfied, wanting to be blown more readily, you could have a look at this [result]( , which is of similar point.
They basically managed to make a macroscopic piece of film stay absolutely still (~ absolute zero temperature), entangle it with a quantum state and arrive at a situation where that piece of film exists under a superimposed state of moving and not-moving. That piece of film, which you could see via (electron) microscope, is your Schrodinger cat.";0;o98pb;[]

The challenge of storing quantum information is that quantum information is stored in spins. An electron can have two different spins, and the difference in energy between two spins is veeeery small, typically. This means that anything that provides more energy than that difference can alter the spin state. Room temperature thermal fluctuations are enough to alter the spin state, preventing a successful quantum application. Being able to store a spin state for 1.3 s is super impressive. What's also impressive is that they can do this with erbium, which is useful for telecommunications. If you wanted to send a quantum state from one place to another, the most common mechanism is to convert the state to a single photon and shoot it at your desired location. The problem with this is that most of the places you want to send quantum info aren't in eyesight, and it's hard to send light through solid things because they absorb. An alternative solution is to use a fiber, which can transport photons. However, fiber rely on bouncing a photon back and forth constantly to prevent it from escaping and direct it to the destination. During these bounces, if there is any imperfection, the single photon with your quantum state will be absorbed and lost. But, we can reliably transport photons about 20 miles. The trouble is, without any other technology, you'd only be able to pass quantum states 20 miles. A quantum repeater is one possible way to avoid this problem.
Imagine that every 20 miles, the photon was re-absorbed by one of these erbium crystals, and then launched again to preserve its quantum state. This would help you overcome the 20 mile limit and the ""eyesight"" restriction. ";0;6zmbnt;[]

Suppose you're sitting in space and you get a gentle push in one direction that lasts indefinitely. Like, you have a solar sail. You're going to accelerate and accumulate kinetic energy. But if you're in orbit around Earth and you get that same push, it does a whole lot less - sometimes you're moving the same way as the push and it accelerates you, and sometimes it's opposite and it slows you down.
If you want to see how a force is going to impact such an orbiting thing you want to make a 'phase plot', which replaces the time coordinate with where in your orbit you are. If something affects you asymmetrically around this phase plot, it can make progress; if it's symmetric, it's going to cause little deviations but not make much progress.
This phase plot looks a bit like you took the time coordinate and rolled it up into a circle.
So, that worked pretty well. But what's better than one time symmetry operation? Two! Or more than two! But if you're visualizing it as rolling time up in one dimension before, now you have to roll it up in two (or more) dimensions. But it was never rolled up in the first place? So whatever, that's a visualization problem, not a physics problem.
Now it may be possible to *model* this as a system with two time dimensions. But that doesn't mean we've unlocked a second time dimension, just like even though one can make a good model of a carbon nanotube's electron sea that involves only one spatial dimension, that doesn't mean the world is purely stuck on a straight line. It's an effective model for a special system that's implemented in normal matter using normal time and space, and the model has requirements and limits.";0;yavq6p;[]

Photons are entangled by passing them through certain non-linear crystals. (We've recently discovered some semiconductor LEDs that do it much more efficiently.) Once you have an entangled pair, any change to the polarization of one will change the polarization of the other, no matter how far apart they are.
In this experiment, they entangled a pair of photons at different frequencies -- one yellow, one red. The yellow photons were shined at a stencil of a cat. The red photons were not. They were then recombined (I think; the article isn't clear) into a single beam of light and into a camera that could only detect the red photons. The image of the cat appeared, although the red photons never touched the stencil.
Two possible applications for this comes to mind, one highly speculative. It's long been considered to be impossible to send information via entangled photons. When you change one photon's polarity, the entangled partner changes instantly no matter how far away, and that would allow you to send information faster than the speed of light. There are reasons why this can't work to send information...but this experiment may be finding a crack in that theory. If so, this could potentially lead to faster than light communications. That's unlikely but it's there.
On a less speculative note, the article suggests one near-term application in imaging. You could shine one light frequency (probably low-energy X-rays) through an object and use a different frequency to look at the image. This could lead to very low exposure X-ray machines, internal imaging of certain materials that we could never look into before (like ferrous metals), and other new imaging tricks.";0;2ewfl3;[]

I only understood the first half since it was basic quantum mechanics but at the end he made it clear that this argument holds only if the 18 or so assumptions he said throughout the talk were true. He ended by saying the significance of this idea is that it strays away from popular quantum field theories and might bring new insight in reconciling gravity and quantum mechanics.;0;8hr7hw;[]

In the study of entropy, there is a concept known as the boltzmann brain. Essentially, if the universe is infinitely old then the probability that insane coincidences will happen rises to infinity. The example they give is that particles come together in an arrangement which is your brain thinking the thoughts it does now.
If the many worlds interpretation is true then there are an infinite amount if worlds where where physics is absolutely fucked up.
Some examples:
A universe where everytime you put gas into an aluminum container it all clings to the right wall.
A universe where no car has ever hit a human being and they can't be made to do so on purpose.
A world where everytime we try to use a particle collider all of the particles quantum tunnel out of the collider.
A world where everytime you say someone's name they are attacked by a massive flock of birds.
A world similar to the above but it only works if they ae actually named Bob and legally changing their name has am effect on this.
A world where all objects that are more than six feet underground experience anti gravity because all of the wave forms collapse in the upward direction.
The reason these work is because of quantum immortality. Each time something would happen that would be different from these, a new world is split off into one where the crazy occurrence happened again.
The worst part is that, in each of these crazy worlds, the inhabitants deduce laws of physics based on these. Those will be entirely consistent and will work to predict their future. But it will only do so on accident because the real laws of probability and physics are being pushed to their limits.
This means that they have no way of knowing that what they think are the laws of physics are in fact just an ever growing chain of improbable coincidences. That also means we don't know that our universe isn't an ever growing chain of improbable coincidences. It is impossible to ever prove that we aren't because, the nature of the system, wil always create a version where our experiment failed to break us out.
The standard quantum physics models talk about how likely things are. Outcome A is 50% likely, B is 30% likely, and C is 20% likely. In the many worlds interpretation A, B, C, D, E,... are all equally likely because they all have a 100% chance of happening.";0;dlvjor;[]

I think in the end all those infinite possibilities (or at least 99% of them) are going to be virtual in nature, sort of like those virtual particles which flash in and out of existence all the time in space. Those virtual particles can read as real momentarily; but then vanish back to whence they came. The other worlds are probably mostly like that too, with the exception being that when the wave function collapses on a particular instant, a MINIMUM number of probable futures are brought into being (the 'winners') creating only a handful of different realities, rather than zillions at every instance. And most of these sooner or later collapse back again to rejoin the original reality at a convenient point (since all these sibling universes tend to be closely related from the beginning anyway, and so can remerge again later). Most of these remerge very quickly; like within seconds or hours at most. Very few alternate timelines last lots longer than that.
Yes, over time (billions of years) this could still result in quite a lot of alternate realities, some of them diverging quite a bit from the original; but nowhere near as many or varied as a more open ended interpretation would suggest. And so would be far less taxing for the cosmos to create and manage.
There might even be a way that relatively 'old' and well developed alternate universes can eventually remerge again at some point, either somewhat sedately, or somewhat catastrophically; and the inhabitants of one or both either simply cease to exist in an instant, or somehow all awareness of any survivors (including physical evidence) automatically adjusts so as to make it impossible to tell that such a remerger ever took place. In other words, such a thing could have happened to us many times; and we'd never know the difference.";0;dlvjor;[]

I argued that on some level, most things in the universe exert gravitational forces and although minute, those forces travel across the entire universe. Therefore I observe the entire universe and it exists because of me therefore I'm god.
It was mostly a joke but now finding out that objects affected by gravity cannot exist in a quantum state really blows my mind. Being able to be affected by gravity is in fact observation and objects that fall into the gaps of observation seem to have limitless potentials.

The most famous proponent of quantum coherence in living systems is of course Roger Penrose, who predicted that microtubules in neurons can sustain coherence for relatively sizable times. This ties into Penrose's ideas about consciousness requiring a quantum mechanical component to work. He also thinks quantum mechanics is incomplete.
Entanglement is not quite the same thing as coherence, but it's a similar enough phenomenon to make me wonder if this is going to renew interest in Penrose's hypothesis. Of course, I'm aware that many Redditors strongly dislike Penrose's ideas. Personally, I'm sitting on the fence. Penrose is a world-famous mathematical genius and theoretical physicist. He's also something of a contrarian and he's pretty old. Also, don't forget that it's possible to be wrong about one topic but right about another. Not all of Penrose's guesses are equal- some are probably completely mistaken, but his other ideas may turn out to be extremely fruitful. Edit: And BTW, I'm not Wikipedia and I didn't use W to write this comment. If you find something I got wrong because I relied on my faulty memory- that's OK. You should feel free to correct me, but please don't heckle me with pedantic comments.

The main takeaway is that the cooling part of a quantum computer, which comprises the most of the building blocks and is an obstacle to mass production, can be possible be left out.
Takeaway:
Pros: possible quantum computers at room temperature, possible more states / redundancy in a single qubit for input. Possible a way towards error-free qubits with a magnitude less error-prone qubits for input. No cooling means it could theoretically be even better than classical computers for some low energy computations. Cons: none stated i could identify but there are probably some, otherwise this would alteady be a thing. Cons like Measurement of qubits are hard or Applying Pauli-Matrices is still in development or state decay is more rapid than with other quantum computer variants. Something along those lines. The article also said that they just started doing it and they hired this PhD Xi to help them. IMO they have an idea what it should be like and are now trying to build it.

In its present form, the entangled particles transmit data instantaneously, but become unentangled after transmitting(but remain in that state for a while afterwards.
The caveat is that they have to be entangled together and then transmitted to their destination, at which point you can transmit the data once.
So, with technological maturity, could you, in theory, could you send a constant stream of these entangled particles to various locations(at light speed) using fiber optics, steadily building up a ""reservoir"" of entangled particles which could then be used to transmit much larger waves of data, but only intermittently?
Theoretically setting up a sort of early-telephones switchboard.
The Quantum Telephone office has connections to nearby buildings, and then connects to a central ""repository"", which receives and redistributes the data in big packets?
Functionally, massive throughput in small periods of time, I think. Maybe good for super long distance data transfer of high volumes where it's actually more efficient to load everything onto a hard drive and then ship it to your destination using traditional means? Obviously, working from a a layman's perspective, just trying to brainstorm how this, in its current iteration might be useful.";0;kojtvm;[]

I mean, just because we can't measure it, doesn't mean it's not there, right? These folks talk about freezing these atoms cold enough to observe 'emergent classicality' where the atoms start to act according to classical physics ... well just because we can't observe these atoms doesn't mean they're not behaving classically *all the time* right? Isn't it stupid to assume our observation is what changes them?
If anything, it seems like us showing up to observe is like taking a spoonful of the ocean and assuming it speaks for the deepest depths ... it's arrogant to assume so, right? But that's (my understanding of) our thinking on quantum mechanics ...

This assumption rules out, for example, the idea that the universe can split, with different outcomes being observed in different parallel universes. I'm surprised this is part of the ""three cherished assumptions"". One of the first thing that was taught to me in quantum computer science is that ""A quantum state is not determined before the measure. Do not consider that we are just observing something that was there all along, measure actively change the quantum state from a superposed state to an observable state."" (that was not presented as a fact, but as an interpretation of quantum physics which is compatible with current knowledge and help to understand it).

Imagine it's night time and you have a billion people arranged in a grid. You've got a camera way up in the air looking down at these people, but you can't see them because it's night time. So, on some of the people, you've put reflective tape (like runners wear) on the tops of their heads. You have a bright flash bulb so that you can flash it and you will briefly see the light reflect off of the tape and see the location of those few people within the grid.
Now, classically, we would expect that if I flash the light and observe a person in position #633 for example, then when I flash it later they'd still be in position #633 (this system is cold so the ""people"" won't move).
Quantum mechanics, however, predicts that if I wait long enough between flashes (let's say an hour), then occasionally the person in #633 will have switched positions with the person in #632 or #634, and if I wait longer they might have even switched with #635 or further. QM even has mathematical predictions as to how far on average they would jump.
If, however, I flash the light very quickly (let's say once every second), then the chances they moved in the short amount of time are pretty much zero. The interesting part is that if I continue to flash the light once a second for 3600 seconds (= 60 minutes = 1 hour) or even longer, then I will still see the person in position #633 remain in position #633.
It appears that the act of flashing the light does more than just let us see it, it also resets the internal quantum mechanical clock of the person back to 0, which is a little weird.
Edit: I should add, this result in some ways is not a new result, but this experiment is an extremely good experiment. Previous results that are similar have been sort of all or nothing (you only look once or you keep the light on all the time, to attempt to continue with the analogy), but this one allows us to fine tune and see the transition from quantum behavior to classical behavior in a continuous way by adjusting the detecting flash's frequency and intensity.
**Edit 2**: Upon digging deeper, my analogy might need adjustment. I don't think the people are in a tight grid, but in a spacious grid with empty gaps. Instead of swapping with another person, the person is moving to a vacant space due to Quantum Mechanics. In the classical limit they would still remain in their place though.
**Edit 3**: Getting a lot of great questions, and some of them repeated, so I'll try to expand more.
* There are two different lasers. The first sets up a standing wave and this standing wave holds the atoms in place, like an egg carton holding eggs. This egg carton doesn't interact with the atoms significantly enough to affect the outcome of the experiment beyond holding them in place. In our analogy, think of it as walls built around each grid, so the person can't walk from one grid to the other. The second laser is the one we use for detection, this is the light source we use to watch the atoms (people) move around (or not move around).
* There are two different Quantum effects that some confuse, the [Uncertainty Principle]( and the [Observer Effect]( This experiment has both. In physics ""observing"" and ""interacting with"" are synonyms, so whenever we talk about watching it's because we shoot photons at the atoms, the electrons absorb those photons, and then the electrons lose that energy and emit different photons (like if I give you a $20 bill and you give me back two $10 bills). We detect the emitted photons and that's how we know where the atoms are. The net result is the atoms remain unchanged. The Uncertainty Principle is the reason the atoms sometimes move. If we weren't firing our second laser the people would occasionally move from one grid space to a nearby empty grid space. This is done through Quantum Tunneling, and might seem unusual if you're unfamiliar with Quantum Mechanics but is well understood (and has been experimentally verified for many decades, and even used to design things like semiconductor materials). The neat part is that the tunneling essentially gets turned off when we're ""watching"" the atoms, i.e. when we fire photons at them and force the atoms to tell us where they are. Even if we weren't around to ""listen"" to the reply, they'd still be stuck where they were just from the photon interaction,
* The really cool part of this experiment has to do with the fact that we can tune the rate of firing light at the atoms. Essentially, lights off means Quantum behavior, lights on means Classical behavior... and now we can dim the lights to anywhere in between, and reduce the amount of Quantum behavior that we get.";0;3pw7xy;[]

In one fame measurement A could occur before measurement B, but in another B could occur before A.
It's true that WF collapse can give correlations between two detectors, which may naively be thought of as requiring speeds faster than c to occur but this correlation can't be used to generate a FTL signal.
An analogy: Suppose Alice is separated from Bob by such a distance that light takes 1 minute to travel between them. Bob and Alice are both tossing coins in which the sequence appears random to each, but which are magically correlated with the other, such that if Bob gets HHTHTT, then Alice gets HHTHTT. Also, suppose that this correlation occurs even if Alice and Bob are tossing the coins within a few seconds of eachother, such that no photon could pass between them in the seconds between Alice and Bob each toss their coin. The correlation could be said to occur faster than light, but note- since the sequences appear random, neither Alice or Bob can exploit that correlation to transmit a signal, like 'Put the kettle on'. Furthermore, according to relativity, an observer traveling at a different speed could find that Alice was actually tossing the coin before Bob, or vice versa. In other words, the order in which A+B perform their tosses depends entirely on the observer.";0;1bavah;[]

In short, the experiment also generates a particle pair and lets these take their own paths through different sections of the setup. Results show that the path that particle A takes in its own section is correlated in a specific way to the path particle B ends up taking. The catch is that B's path would seem to be determined after particle A has already been measured. If B's path causes A's path to change, the future has impacted the past. The setup also seems to exclude A's path causing B's path to change as it would lead to other bizarre conclusions, like requiring that the entire setup is ""known"" to A.

""Researchers inside and outside the company have been unable to conclusively prove that the devices can tap into quantum physics to beat out conventional computers.""
""The computer that lost in the contest with the quantum machine was running code that had it solve the problem at hand using an algorithm similar to the one baked into the D-Wave chip. An alternative algorithm is known that could have let the conventional computer be more competitive, or even win, by exploiting what Neven called a bug in D-Waves design. Neven said the test his group staged is still important because that shortcut wont be available to regular computers when they compete with future quantum annealers capable of working on larger amounts of data.""

If I have two marbles I've ""entangled"" so I know when I look at one the other one will be the same color, but I cannot look at what color they are, and I put one in a box and ship it a hundred miles away, of COURSE the marble I put in the box is going to be the same as the other one when I look at both. That doesn't mean information was transmitted instantly from one to the other.
I mean, is there any way to do the same exact thing to entangle two photons, move them apart, then then do something ELSE that breaks the entanglement before you actually examine them, so they end up being different? Something other than modifying the photons I mean. I mean the minute you do that, of course they're gonna be different because they were the same, and you changed one.
I just don't get why the most obvious answer to what's going on here is not considered to be the correct one. How do we know the photon wasn't already in the same state immediately after entanglent, and that it didn't take on that state ONLY after being measured?";0;oc9n1n;[]

1. Quantum Computers need a Superconductor to work, and not just any Superconductor, but one locked into a finite state and stabilized.
2. Currently to do this we have to basically cool the material down to very very very close to absolute zero. **If we ever figure out a way to achieve this at more reasonable temperatures, Quantum Computers aren't the only thing this tech applies to.** Most of human life as we know it would fundamentally change if we can figure out a way to lock in super conductors at reasonable temps (and this isnt just being a super conductor, its a **stable** super conductor)
3. This process takes **several days** to perform, for *one* calculation. You heard me. And 99% of that time is that whole ""cooling it down to almost absolute zero"" part I mentioned above, as well as trial and error. See what happens is they cool it down annnd... nope it failed, try again. Repeat several times til it locks in right. Even if you get it on the first try, it will take easily 1-2 days for *one* calc. And there's not much we can do to speed it up because its literally just sitting around waiting for it to get cold.
4. And to **keep** it that cold so it works, the thing needs to sit in a giant room with multiple layers of protection, cooling, heat sinks, you name it. A single Quantum Computer unit takes up an entire room, and it needs to be a Clean Room, everyone in suits.
5. And by the way, the cost to have a couple engineers run the thing, all the cooling liquid, the mountains of electricity, the equipment... Each calculation costs a small fortune to simply just run it.
6. Modern encryption algorithms would require a QPU several billion times more powerful than what we have right now. And if we just bump up the tier of encryption people use on basic stuff one tick, just a ever so slight bump of the knob up, it becomes several billion *times* more of a requirement yet again. You go from needing a couple billion qubits to a couple billion *billion* qubits, with just a nudge of encryption tier up, just like that.
So for perspective now:
Imagine if it took several days and fifty thousand dollars to hack **one** encrypted item, like, **one** email, *and* that email has to use an *extremely* outdated form of encryption from like, 20+ years ago. And we have millions and millions of qubits to work with (as opposed to the, what are we at, like 200 now on the most advanced QPU? Did we hit 400 yet?)
Then I mean yep, you can do that, sure hope that email was worth the 50K it cost to crack.
And I mean, hey, if its like, super critical information conferred between some politician and someone else 20 years ago that matters now... Maybe it could be.
But no one is gonna drop 50K on cracking your portable hard drive full of ~~porn~~ ""family photos""";0;ojr4kr;[]

That is true about software at a high level, but quantum communications are not built on traditional software - they are able to exploit a form of information transfer that is not based on the classical computing paradigm of binary information, so the same high level software principles do not apply. To use a quantum computer to communicate, you create a system of (usually two) connected (entangled) sub-atomic particles. I think most places use hydrogen atoms. The information is encoded in the electron of the hydrogen atom, which can have two possible states, and can be in either state simultaneously until it is measured. Once you take the measurement, the combined state collapses into one of the two possible states. When you measure one, it collapses both states. You can therefore alter the state of one, and have your partner measure the other to transmit information. If someone tries to intercept the message, your partner will see that the stare has already been measured when he receives it. This will alert both parties that someone is spying. This is one of two ways the system is unhackable The other way is due to the fact that the system itself is comprised of entangled hydrogen atoms. Since you can transfer information in this quantum way, the entire system can be classically analog. Most of our missiles are analog so they cant be hacked remotely. This would make the system unhackable in the sense that it cannot be done remotely, which is probably perfectly sufficient for the DOD Tl;dr- I am a quantum physics student.

I'm not sure if it is exactly the same process as the one he mentioned, but he told me a big part of the process of creating this energy with water required aluminum and the aluminum is practically destroyed and or unusable after this process. So this sort of thing long term is not gong to be a solution to our problems. I think a lot of people should seriously watch the anime series: Fullmetal Alchemist for their very interesting theory about a ""rule of equivalent exchange."" Translating outside of the clear fantasy aspects of the animation, it basically states that something of equal value must be used to ""create something."" Basically they realize that there is no such thing as ""renewable"" anything and that this is a flawed ideology. I 100% believe that nothing on this planet is ""renewable"" and that for us to continue existing ""long term"" we need to take a much more conservative route to our resources. Precious minerals should only be used for advancement of technology that ACTUALLY benefits humanity, so no more smart phones, no more computers, no more dish washers, no more clothes washers and dryers, no more cars, etc. You cannot ""infinitely"" cycle anything and we have proof of this in the food cycle. Every time you drink water, eat food, etc. some of this energy is lost as heat or simply through the process of turning the materials into usable energy our bodies can use. If you drank a glass of water, urinated through a filtration system boiled that leftover liquid and drank it, you do this enough times and the only thing you're going to be left with is waste material that will not give you any benefit by consuming it. At least this is my current understanding. Sure that energy htat is lost in heat or evaporated will go through the atmosphere, rise up, collect together, form clouds, then rain etc. we all know the water cycle.... This takes a lot of time to happen. not nearly as much as the earth forming precious minerals. Yeah aluminium is one of the cheapest materials on the planet, but it won't be for very long if we use it for energy.
I mean shoot even batteries are limited, that lithium or Ion is being ""used up' in those batteries, so even 100% battery operated vehicles will eventually create waste that will be extremely toxic to our environment. ";0;9kpha3;[]

But the way I understand it is that the two particles are somehow intrinsically linked; it's not that one particle is communicating with the other in some way that implies a transmission of information faster than the speed of light, but rather the particles are moving at exactly the same moment, which suggests that they are connected in a way that does not need any physical transmission of data, which to me implies some other realm of connection that we perhaps don't know of yet. Some type of connection between particles (perhaps all particles?) that is a basic element of how the universe is made up, that we do not yet understand, and is more fundamental than our ideas of object A having to travel through space and time in order to communicate with object B.

* The cryptography underlying crypto isn't unique to crypto--it's used in a TON of fields. Which is to say, there are A LOT of vested interests in not having cryptography by broken. Which leads to point two:
* Even if QCs are improving and advancing, SO TOO IS CRYPTOGRAPHY. It's not a static field, there are a lot of very smart people working it, and there are huge swathes of the economy--again, way bigger than crypto--riding on keeping things private/secure/encrypted.
* Aside from any of that, [the odds of cracking the encryption underlying crypto are low](, and are relatively easy to make even lower even without getting into significant advances in current encryption technology.

If you were to introduce a phase shifter in one of the paths between the crystals and kept changing the amount of phase shift, you could cause constructive and destructive interference at the detectors. For example, each of the crystals could be generating, say, 1,000 pairs of photons per second. With constructive interference, the detectors would register 4,000 pairs of photons per second. And with destructive interference, they would detect none: the system as a whole would not create any photons even though individual crystals would be generating 1,000 pairs a second. That is actually quite crazy, when you think about it, Krenn says.

It's still dependent on classic comm methods (fiber) to transfer entangled qubits between nodes. Transferring those entangled qubits will always be bound by C.
For example, take 2 small pieces of paper. Write the letter A on one. Write the letter Z on the other. Crumple/fold/whatever them. Mix them up. They're now entangled. Send one to your cousin the other side of the world and explain the A/Z rule. It will never move FTL. But once your cousin opens his piece of paper, he instantly knows what your piece of paper says. And when you open yours you instantly know what his says. *magic fingers* Quantum Communication.

The study has big implications for quantum information technology - the future of how sensitive information is shared and stored.
The researchers published their results on June 28, 2019 in Communications Physics.
""Quantum teleportation permits the transfer of quantum information into an otherwise inaccessible space,"" said Hideo Kosaka, a professor of engineering at Yokohama National University and an author on the study. ""It also permits the transfer of information into a quantum memory without revealing or destroying the stored quantum information.""
The inaccessible space, in this case, consisted of carbon atoms in diamond. Made of linked, yet individually contained, carbon atoms, a diamond holds the perfect ingredients for quantum teleportation.
A carbon atom holds six protons and six neutrons in its nucleus, surrounded by six spinning electrons. As the atoms bond into a diamond, they form a notoriously strong lattice. Diamonds can have complex defects, though, when a nitrogen atom exists in one of two adjacent vacancies where carbon atoms should be. This defect is called a nitrogen-vacancy center.

Further, at microscopic levels, it's true that determinism and certainties are not completely likely, but only statistical. Still, 99% likely isn't easy to ignore as the effect/event will persist almost all of the time.
The border zone between macroscopic events and quantum event levels are a real conundrum in physics. Why does this transition occur and how does it come about are real questions. But reality has to be better defined than the authors above have even TRIED to do, & that of course is the writing ethic being maimed once again.
In quantum reality particles can move thru others by quantum tunneling, simply going around the distance. IN macroscopic world, electrons prevent that, mostly. Entanglement and other weird events can occur, whereas a simple interaction with said particle and another can cause its loss of entangling. The odd characteristics of Bose-Einstein condensates are getting more and more well defined, too, within the probabilities. And it's fairly clear that even on the quantum level, light speed is only a probability, not a certainty, too. Otherwise, how would we measure light speed with only say 20 photons? We'd come up with some which moved faster than cee and others near cee and others more slowly. It's only when vast numbers of photons are measured under set conditions that light speed arises as a constant. The universe is a lot fuzzier at quantum levels than macroscopically.";0;38yywm;[]

I'm actually taking a class on the mathematics of quantum computing and this basically means nothing.

Furthermore, we don't even know if a wormhole exists in nature, afaik none have actually been discovered.

The Bitcoin network security uses a cryptographic algorithm called SHA-256 and is, as of now, utterly impenetrable for modern computers. Researchers estimate that future quantum computers with 1.9 billion qubits, on the other hand, would be able to crack it within 10 minutes.

**This experiments goal was to try to make qubits more stable.**
Qubits are quantum bits, or units of information storage with properties seen in quantum physics particles. In the same way a digital computer stores information in binary bits of 1s and 0s, a quantum computer tries to hold information in inherently unstable qubits 1/0s and 0/1s. We want this feature from qubits because it allows for, in theory, computationally work-heavy tasks to be done much faster, as qubits allow for an extra superposition for calculations to take place, mathematically.
The problem is that qubits lose this extra superposition quality the more we use them. This is because their superpositions degrade or decohere into non-superposition each time we measure their information state as a 1, 0, 1/0, or 0/1. When that happens, we no longer can use the quantum computers special features.
This research team sought to fix this problem by providing a non-repeating structure to elongate the amount of time a qubit can stay in superposition. Whats special is that they used a mathematical structure to mimic a quasi-crystal (a crystal with a stable, non-repeating pattern) in time. By doing this, the superpositions of the qubits could be read without collapsing for longer. **This means the experiment found a potential way for qubits to remain super for longer by giving them a non-repeating pattern to help them stay super, which could help us build more efficient quantum computers.**
Hope that helps! (Physicists dont be too mad at me lol)";0;ysg8ft;[]

ONE: You Can't Win. Mater and energy can never be created or destroyed, only changed. The only way to end up with more matter/energy (for they are both forms of each other) is to get it from outside the system - but that only changes our focus to a larger system.
TWO: You Can't Break Even. If energy can leak out of a system, it will. If not, it will flatten out across the system as much as possible. This process is called entropy, and is the common source of all chaos and death in the universe. It is the common source of everything human beings consider to be bad. And until now, it has appeared to be irreversible.
THREE: You Can't Even Quit The Game. The amount of entropy in a system will asymptotically approach the maximum, meaning that the process gets closer and closer to ending but never quite ends.";0;b0qbe7;[]

Nikita Gourianov is a physicist at Oxford university that works with computational quantum physics. Here he argues that people have become wildly over-optimistic on the prospects of quantum computing.
Financial bubbles occur when large groups of investors repeatedly make poor investment decisions, often due to greed, misunderstanding and easy money. A modern-day example of this is quantum computing.
Quantum computing is often portrayed as an up-and-coming technology whose eventual impact will only be rivalled by artificial intelligence. According to the quantum evangelists, it is only a matter of time before a fully-functional quantum computer will appear and do everything from revolutionising drug development to cracking internet encryption schemes.
Billions of dollars have poured into the field in recent years, culminating with the public market debuts of prominent quantum computing companies like IonQ, Rigetti and D-Wave through 2021s favourite frothy market phenomenon, special purpose acquisition vehicles (Spacs).
These three jointly still have a market capitalisation of $3bn, but combined expected sales of about $32mn this year (and about $150mn of net losses), according to Refinitiv. Heres what their stocks have done this year.
The reality is that none of these companies or any other quantum computing firm, for that matter are actually earning any real money. The little revenue they generate mostly comes from consulting missions aimed at teaching other companies about how quantum computers will help their business, as opposed to genuinely harnessing any advantages that quantum computers have over classical computers.
The simple reason for this is that despite years of effort nobody has yet come close to building a quantum machine that is actually capable of solving practical problems. The current devices are so error-prone that any information one tries to process with them will almost instantly degenerate into noise. The problem only grows worse if the computer is scaled up (ie, the number of qubits increased).
A convincing strategy for overcoming these errors has not yet been demonstrated, making it unclear as to when if ever it will become possible to build a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer. Yet according to the evangelists, we are apparently in the middle of a Quantum Moores Law (aka Roses Law, after D-Wave founder Geordie Rose) analogous to the microchip revolution of the 1970s 2010s.
Another fundamental issue is that it is unclear what commercially-useful problems can even be solved with quantum computers if any.
The most prominent application by far is the Shor algorithm for factorising large numbers into their constituent primes, which is exponentially faster than any known corresponding scheme running on a classical computer. Since most cryptography currently used to protect our internet traffic are based on the assumed hardness of the prime factorisation problem, the sudden appearance of an actually functional quantum computer capable of running Shors algorithm would indeed pose a major security risk.
Shors algorithm has been a godsend to the quantum industry, leading to untold amounts of funding from government security agencies all over the world. However, the commonly forgotten caveat here is that there are many alternative cryptographic schemes that are not vulnerable to quantum computers. It would be far from impossible to simply replace these vulnerable schemes with so-called quantum-secure ones.
And the uncertain practical viability of Shors algorithm is only the tip of the iceberg. There has been much controversy regarding where and when quantum computing can actually offer any practical advantage. The latest research points out that there is no evidence that even quantum chemistry calculations can be significantly sped up with quantum computers. That is bad news for the much-touted idea of quantum computers being useful for drug design.
In essence, the quantum computing industry has yet to demonstrate any practical utility, despite the fanfare. Why is then so much money flowing in? Well, it is mainly due to the fanfare. The views of scientists are still (mostly) respected in society, and so when physicists get excited about something, people notice.
The excitement truly began in the 90s, which saw a range of pioneering breakthroughs that truly marked the birth of quantum technologies as an academic field. As more progress was made over the years, the excitement grew, eventually going well beyond the community.
By the 2010s capital had become cheap, and investors started taking notice, even if they had no real understand of the technology (beyond the a qubit can simultaneously be both one and zero clich). As more money flowed in, the field grew, and it became progressively more tempting for scientists to oversell their results. With time, salesman-type figures, typically without any understanding of quantum physics, entered the field, taking senior positions in companies and focusing solely on generating fanfare. After a few years of this, a highly exaggerated perspective on the promise of quantum computing reached the mainstream, leading to a greed and misunderstanding taking hold and the formation of a classical bubble.
Some physicists believe, in private, that there is no problem here: why not take advantage of the situation while it lasts, and take the easy money from the not-too-sophisticated investors? Earning a private-sector level salary whilst doing essentially academic research is a pretty good deal, after all.
Well, when exactly the bubble will pop is difficult to say, but at some point the claims will be found out and the funding will dry up. I just hope that when the music stops and the bubble pops, the public will still listen to us physicists.";0;x5d6j2;[]

Original problem was analytically proved to be impossible for a 6x6 grid in 1900.
As I understand it. They changed the problem so that each grid member has a quantum superposition of different states (ie vectors of quantities for the all regiments and all the ranks).
Then, they redefined what it means for two people to be different from simply having a different regiment and rank, to instead mean that the vectors of each of those people are perpendicular (orthogonal) to each other.";0;t1l724;[]

The quantum teleportation of a qubit is achieved using quantum entanglement, in which two or more particles are inextricably linked to each other. If an entangled pair of particles is shared between two separate locations, no matter the distance between them, the encoded information is teleported.

Reading the [actual paper]( they start from the well-observed fact that times runs slower in a strong gravitational field than a weaker one. So if two clocks interacted, the one in the stronger gravitational field would be - is - seen as being slower. Your head runs a little bit faster than your feet when you are standing up. Denver runs ahead of Miami beach. Now, the arm wave. They imagine a gravitational mass that has quantum properties. This could exist in several locations, each of which would have differing effects on the two clocks. Alternatively, you have two masses that have differing probabilities of existing. (Yes, I know.) This would alter the relative time that the clocks tell in ways that would be ""quantum determined"". So time is indeterminate and with a yet greater arm wave, they adduce from this that so is causality. Modest problem is that the physical uncertainty of a massive body is utterly trivial. Hawkin showed how slow quantum demolition is in destroying a black hole, for example. Cups do not blink about on a table top.";0;cu871h;[]

Actually though, might we someday be able to send messages one at a time through a black hole to another universe, and receive messages as well from... wait ... what does the entry point INTO our universe from another universe look like? That is, what is the physical inverse of a black hole?
Also, does quantum connectivity of separate pairs persist into or through a black hole? I imagine it breaks at the event horizon.
Why doesn't a black hole keep growing by sucking up virtual particles from the vacuum sea over the eons? (Instead of evaporating through Hawking radiation?)
NS article notes ""In this new model, the gravitational field still increases as you near the black hole's core.""
To me that implies that black holes have increasing density as you approach the 'core'. But if the core were immensely high density, how could it be a gateway out of this universe? So maybe at its center there might be such a thing but you would have to pass through the dense core's outer layer to get there. So in effect it might be barricaded.";0;1f9ha2;[]

We know the truth about time, it's a dimension that we live in, and doesn't move.

If you can entangle particles in time like you can in space, then isn't that just corroborating the whole space-time theory? And if you can remove two entangled particles a great distance apart with their co-influence being instant as to bridge the speed of C barrier, then why couldn't you do the same with entangled particles across time?

If I understand the patent language properly, the invention is relatively simple, and explainable with a basic idea of what a (classical) CPU does.
We want a quantum computer to run a program across multiple ""SIMD Regions"" over multiple cycles -- in this model, each region runs zero or one operations per cycle, and can only hold the data it is working with.
Quantum computers store and work with information in ""qubits"". It is not possible to copy qubits; moving a qubit is called quantum teleportation. While quantum teleportation is a normal and common part of a quantum computer, each move adds noise to the results, so we want to do it less.
The prior approach to managing a qubit is that at the start of every cycle:
* If a region needs it, move it there
* Else if its region is idle (i.e. has no operation), leave it in place * Else move it to global memory
The patent approach is:
* If a region needs it, move it there
* **Else if another region is idle, and will use the qubit when it stops being idle, move it there**
* Else if its region is idle, leave it in place * Else move it to global memory
So this allows for a direct copy in more cases, saving one move each time.";0;pghepu;[]

Physicist here, phonons and photons are the same kind of particle at theoretical level. Both are excitations of fields - photon the electromagnetic field while, phonons quantum electronic fields of periodic potential (lattice) Just like any other quantum particles both can be created and destroyed while also existing in other weird combination of those creation and destruction. Phonons are very well understood objects and Infact one of the main reasons for superconductivity in materials. Phonons have very major role in lot a of everyday technologies, right from solar cells to semiconductors. For instance, these phonon particles can interact with electrons in solid and entirely change the property of the material. Phonons are most prominent at higher temperatures (since they are excited states of lattice vibrations, higher the temperature more the lattice jiggles and more energy the phonon gets). Its very comon in physics to model excited states of systems as particles, for instance, there are excited states of a particle made up of both photon and phonon- it is called polariton and an excited state of photon and exciton ( exciton is electron and positron combined) which is called a polaron and so on. They beauty of quantum physics is that when you combine elementary particles (electrons) they interact so complexly that they give birth to new quasi particles which can be described (to a very good approximation) as non interacting particles. For further reading, read about the beautiful idea of emergence in condensed matter physics
I have got tons of messages asking about other quasi particles. Heres not so exhaustive list of em. -	Fermi electrons -	Phonons
-	Cooper pairs -	Excitons -	Polrons -	Polritons -	Weyl fermions -	Dirac fermions
-	Nodal fermions
-	Majorana fermion. You read it right ! Last one is the most esoteric of the lot as it is its own antiparticle. Its as of now a theoretical construct and these are very very hard to isolate and observe. Once found experimentally , these are the perfect candidates for Qi it for quantum computing without a shadow of doubt and probably will fetch you a noble prize too!

> Time has a fundamentally different character in quantum mechanics and in general relativity. In quantum theory events unfold in a fixed order while in general relativity temporal order is influenced by the distribution of matter. When matter requires a quantum description, temporal order is expected to become non-classicala scenario beyond the scope of current theories. Here we provide a direct description of such a scenario. We consider a thought experiment with a massive body in a spatial superposition and show how it leads to entanglement of temporal orders between time-like events. This entanglement enables accomplishing a task, violation of a Bell inequality, that is impossible under local classical temporal order; it means that temporal order cannot be described by any pre-defined local variables. A classical notion of a causal structure is therefore untenable in any framework compatible with the basic principles of quantum mechanics and classical general relativity.";0;cu871h;[]

The encryption could be inversed with a quantum computer with 372 qubits, or a basic unit of information acting as a proxy for computation power. Experts estimate that it would take ordinary computers 300 trillion years to break an encryption key.

The vibrational motion is then restricted to the stationary eigenmodes of the resonator, which thus serves as local storage for phonons. In contrast, we couple propagating phonons to an artificial atom in the quantum regime and reproduce findings from quantum optics, with sound taking over the role of light. Our results highlight the similarities between phonons and photons but also point to new opportunities arising from the characteristic features of quantum mechanical sound. The low propagation speed of phonons should enable new dynamic schemes for processing quantum information, and the short wavelength allows regimes of atomic physics to be explored that cannot be reached in photonic systems.;0;cyg5vi;[]

I work with Majorana fermions (theoretically). To put this into context:
[This research]( provides very high quality experimental evidence for the existence of Majorana bound states.
Majorana bound states arise in certain superconductors. Superconductivity is an inherently quantum mechanical phenomenon, where electrons form pairs, which then do weird quantum stuff. So, if you want to build a quantum computer, superconductors are a good place to look.
Describing majorana bound states as a ""half-electron"" is a bit, well, not quite misleading, but not a good idea either. For instance, they have no electric charge. A more accurate description would be: A majorana bound state is to an electron what the real and imaginary part are to a complex number.
The fact that Majorana bound states could be useful for quantum computation was first pointed out by [A. Kitaev in 2000][1]. This was a fairly theoretical idea until, in 2010, there were [two][2] [suggestions][3] that Majorana fermions should be present in certain systems that we can actually realize in the laboratory. Early reports, [like in 2012][4], claimed to have done this, but the evidence was not that good. Now it's 2018, and we're finally seeing high quality experiments that work as the theory suggested about a decade ago. So, yes, the progress is great, but it's been a long road almost 20 years in the making.
I've heard the story that some time after hearing about Majorana bound states, [Michael Freedman][5] approached Bill Gates and asked whether he would fund this approach to building a quantum computer. Today, Microsoft is indeed paying top dollar to pursue this. My guess is that it will still take > 10 years to actually build a quantum computer. [1]: [2]: [3]: [4]: [5]: ";0;88i5eq;[]

When processing data with qubits opposed to standard binary bits. Unlike processing data using standard computing bits which exists as a 0 or 1 a qubit can be a 0, 1, or a superposition of both. The superpositional state of the qubit opens up drastically more computational potential to analyze and output all potential outcomes instead of just one or another. This is why you see different companies like IBM and Google racing to develop coherent quantum computers with more qubits to tackle these issues.

Using this for detecting gravitational waves with better sensitivity isn't new either, this idea was also proposed around the same time. Actual demonstrations of this are somewhat newer, but has still been around a few years. What is new here is a specific application of a specific technique which is closer to actually detecting gravitational waves than previous schemes.

The teleportation we speak of depends on entanglement of quantum states. Two particles are entangled when they are described by a single wavefunction and you cannot decompose their state as being two separable wavefunctions. This means that a measurement on one particle instantly affects the other. This ""spooky action at a distance"" was the reason Einstein did not believe that quantum theory was complete.
One of the most common examples of an entangled state of two particles is the so-called singlet state. I will connect this analogy to each particle being a coin that can be H(Heads) or T(Tails)
Singlet state = [1/sqrt(2)] ( |HT> - |TH> )
The [1/sqrt(2)] is simply a normalization factor, it's not important for the discussion.
To be fully clear: |HT> = 1st coin is heads, 2nd coin is tails
This quantum state describes a 50/50 chance each particle is in the state heads or tails.
However, once you make a measurement on either coin, you necessarily know the state of the other coin.
If we look at the 1st coin and it's T, the wavefunction is changed instantly from this measurement and the |HT> component is projected out because we know the 1st coin is not heads. This leaves us with |TH> so we know that the 2nd coin is heads.
Regardless of the distance between the two particles, once a measurement is made on one particle of the entangled state it instantly affects the others. Now to preserve causality... if Alice and Bob are very far away and Alice makes a measurement on her coin and it is tails, Bob won't know that his coin is heads until Alice communicates via a classical channel( limited by the speed of light) what her result was. Then he knows what state his coin is, without having to measure it and irreversibly affect it.

The ""code key"" can be intercepted, but not the message itself since the message ""teleports"" instantanously. Why would the normal internet need this given the need for a conventionally sent key?

Let me quote from Lumo's blog
*In classical physics, complex numbers would be used as bookkeeping devices to remember the two coordinates of a two-dimensional vector; the complex numbers also knew something about the length of two-dimensional vectors. But this usage of the complex numbers was not really fundamental. In particular, the multiplication of two complex numbers never directly entered physics.*
*This totally changed when quantum mechanics was born. The waves in quantum mechanics had to be complex, ""exp(ikx)"", for the waves to remember the momentum as well as the direction of motion. And when you multiply operators or state vectors, you actually have to multiply complex numbers (the matrix elements) according to the rules of complex multiplication.*
*Now, we need to emphasize that it doesn't matter whether you write the number as ""exp(ikx)"", ""cos(kx)+i.sin(kx)"", ""cos(kx)+j.sin(kx)"", or ""(cos kx, sin kx)"" with an extra structure defining the product of two 2-component vectors. It doesn't matter whether you call the complex numbers ""complex numbers"", ""Bambelli's spaghetti"", ""Euler's toilets"", or ""Feynman's silly arrows"". All these things are mathematically equivalent. What matters is that they have two inseparable components and a specific rule how to multiply them.*
*The commutator of ""x"" and ""p"" equals ""xp-px"" which is, for two Hermitean (real-eigenvalue-boasting) operators, an anti-Hermitean operator i.e. ""i"" times a Hermitean operator (because its Hermitean conjugate is ""px-xp"", the opposite thing). You can't do anything about it: if it is a c-number, it has to be a pure imaginary c-number that we call ""i.hbar"". The uncertainty principle forces the complex numbers upon us.*
*So the imaginary unit is not a ""trick"" that randomly appeared in one application of some bizarre quantum mechanics problem - and something that you may humiliate. The imaginary unit is guaranteed to occur in any system that reduces to classical physics in a limit but is not a case of classical physics exactly.*
*Completely universally, the commutator of Hermitean operators - that are ""deduced"" from real classical observables - have commutators that involve an ""i"". That means that their definitions in any representation that you may find have to include some ""i"" factors as well. Once ""i"" enters some fundamental formulae of physics, including Schrdinger's (or Heisenberg's) equation, it's clear that it penetrates to pretty much all of physics. In particular: In quantum mechanics, probabilities are the only thing we can compute about the outcomes of any experiments or phenomena. And the last steps of such calculations always include the squaring of absolute values of complex probability amplitudes. Complex numbers are fundamental for all predictions in modern science.*
People who claim that quantum physics is equivalent to engineering problems IMHO fundamentally misunderstand both engineering mathematics and quantum physics.";0;rhooth;[]

> The only things known to go faster than ordinary light is monarchy, according to the philosopher Ly Tin Weedle. He reasoned like this: you cant have more than one king, and tradition demands that there is no gap between kings, so when a king dies the succession must therefore pass to the heir instantaneously. Presumably, he said, there must be some elementary particles - kingons, or possibly queons - that do this job, but of course succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an anti-particle, or republicon. His ambitious plans to use his discovery to send messages, involving the careful torturing of a small king in order to modulate the signal, were never fully expounded because, at that point, the bar closed.

A lattice of entangled quantum particles, (given enough time to ""spread out"") will weave together to form space-time. I am unsure though if we can discern that every quantum particle has a pair or not, maybe an assumption here. It also seems like this theory is trying to project the phenomena of entangled qubits forming +1 dimensions from there own, to explain why we perceived 4 dims as our consensus reality. While M/String theory predict their to be 11/10 dims in total, with the others curled up in to CalabiYau manifold. I wonder how this theory co-exist with those...
Also, I am unsure how much we can transpose phenomena occurring in an anti de Sitter space to that of a Hilbert space, like our own consensus reality.

If there was a 2D universe that expanded as far as the current universe, could it not be folded into a single point in the 3rd dimension yet still seem so extremely expansive to whatever perceives the universe as 2D? From a 3D perspective they'll be twisting, turning, and bending through the countless folds in a single point, but to them it'll feel like they're moving in their normal X and Y coordinates because they do not perceive the 3rd dimension.
Likewise, could we not say that a 3D universe could be folded into a single point in the 4th dimension, yet our movement in the 3rd dimension will seem normal as we only perceive X, Y, and Z coordinates? However in the 4th dimension we'd simply just be twisting, bending, and warping in a single point?
In this case, actions at a distance wouldn't be all that spooky, it's simply perceived that way. In our 2D world, something could travel to any point in the perceived universe in a split second simply by moving in the 3rd dimension. In the 3rd dimension, one could travel to any point in the universe in a split second my simply moving in the 4th dimension.

In the end, I don't feel all that bad for large investors because they can afford to hire a genuine expert as a consultant before they commit to an investment. Also, I imagine at least some of them understand the situation, but have enough money they're not necessarily going to miss and think that there might be enough potential to justify the risk.
I think the main worry is that if the bubble bursts, there won't be adequate funding for anything related to quantum computing, including legit research projects. I don't know if he expresses this particular worry, but that's what would concern me.
What bugs me personally is to see funding wasted on glossy start-ups which probably don't amount to much more than a fancy PowerPoint filled with jargon instead of being poured into PhD programs - and not just at MIT and a select few others, but at various universities across the world. There are smart people everywhere, but one of the reasons many universities can't work on concrete solutions is because they can't afford the materials, tech, and partnerships. You also have people bogged down by side jobs, needing to support a family, etc. which can scatter focus and limit the amount of research-related travel they can do. Adequate funding would lessen these burdens and make it easier for researchers to work together and to take some risks as well.";0;x5d6j2;[]

So it's a nice achievement, but a useful quantum computer is still some leaps away.

That being said, how are they selecting which pair to put where, If I can pick 1 of the pair and choose between turning it into a 1 or a 0 and the other pair will be the opposite then I'll believe it, but if I pick the pair with one type of spin and move the other pair to with the other type of spin to the other side and then snap them into place, they would have already been decided what they are based on their spins and back to point 1, you can't actually know if you've already set them in place or not without observing them in which you wouldn't actually see them get set you would just see the result and assume you're setting them.

First off, the device they have can only be used to perform this one task. As such, I don't think it fits the definition of a ""computer"" because it lacks the ability to be programmed. What seems to be a minor nitpick is, in practice, a very important point.
Second, this device uses optics, which is the simplest way to build wrt physics. Given enough precision, it can be built in a lab using standard equipment; the caveat being the precision. And this is also what makes this remarkable, what they built around to achieve needed precision. How well it scales for more complex problems remains to be seen.
Third, those machines always target simple quantum problems. Those problems are hard for classic computers, sure, but easy for quantum simulators (avoiding the word computer here). It is a great feat, but more fitting would be to say that this is an experiment that proves a thesis or finds a constant.
But the original authors are at least open about that, something you don't always see in the quantum sphere, especially when it comes to news:
> Building a fault-tolerant quantum computer to run Shors algorithm, however, still requires long-term efforts.
Fault-tolerant quantum computing for more complex algorithms and not just simulation of quantum problems is still far off. Shor's algorithm is a whole different beast regarding quantum computing requirements. But that's not what's selling news. Instead you have people talking about Bitcoin suddenly being insecure (which honestly would be among the least of our problems).";0;k8cxw7;[]

Take the experiment, model it as a quantum circuit, encode that circuit into CCNOT + H, and now you have a real-number-only model of the situation. (Not that you'd want to use instead of the much more elegant original circuit that used operations whose matrices contained imaginary numbers.) I assume the paper is sneaking in some unstated assumption, that disallows something about the encoding step, in order to make the result go through.
On further reading, they actually do mention this in the paper:
> Our results rely on the assumption that the independence of two or more quantum systems is captured by the tensor product structure. If we drop this assumption, there exist real frameworks alternative to quantum theory that have the same predictive power, such as Bohmian mechanics [32] or real quantum physics with a universal qubit [33].
In other words, the complex-to-real encoding must have the property that you can independently encode the parts of the system, and then put them together in the usual way (tensor products), and get the same result as if you'd encoded the entire system. I think the reason this is such a problem is that going from complex numbers to real numbers involves adding a degree of freedom to separate complex numbers into one real number for the real part and one real number for the imaginary part. But if you encode each part separately you end up creating this real vs imaginary distinction multiple times instead of one time, which creates a mess.";0;rh3nji;[]

Finally, there are tons of things that could be emulated and not be measured, i.e. there are infinite things which do not exist that would need processing if nature bothered with that. Since the number of things which do not exist are far greater than the things that exist, nature would be in trouble emulating them all.

There, the two photons were entangled with each other and this caused both their partner electrons to become entangled, too.

With magnets, we can simply set the state to on, and it would remain on without further energy requirements. This would mean much smaller transistors, and therefore, much smaller and more powerful technology.

The apparent divergence from the initial ""location"" is a result of space and time expanding, but perhaps the entanglement process is unaffected by that apparent expansion, it may remain timeless and dimensionless so all points are all still connected to and through the singularity, thus we have ""spooky action at a distance"" via a timeless dimensionless point that is connected directly to everything.
Maybe we are still ""inside"" that singularity in some sense, the expansion of space time being a projection of temporal and material properties into our 3 dimensions?

Just a stub of an article. Here it is right here.
>Technology continues to move forward at incredible speeds and it seems like every week we learn about a new breakthrough that changes our minds about what is possible.
>Researchers in Toronto used a photonic quantum computer chip to solve a sampling problem that went way beyond the fastest computers and algorithms.
>The paper the researchers published says that the Borealis quantum chip took only 36 microseconds to solve a problem that would take supercomputers and algorithms 9,000 years to figure out.
>Yes, you read that right9,000 years.
>The Borealis chip uses bursts of light to transmit quantum information and the researchers believe that this is a huge leap forward for quantum chips.
>""The authors of the study said,
>This work is a critical milestone on the path to a practical quantum computer, validating key technological features of photonics as a platform for this goal.
>Quantum computers are different from traditional computers and one major way is to process three units of data instead of only two. The computers we are used to use binary (0, 1) and quantum computers use what is called qubits (0, 1, both).
>While this news is certainly exciting, quantum computers still have a long road ahead of them. The UK Ministry of Defence purchased its first quantum computer in order to run tests, but it could be years before we know how or when theyll be used regularly.
Here is the paper.
And if I'm not mistaken a photonic quantum computer can run at room temperature.

Like let's say that you quickly check a given position. Are we manipulating it in a specific way to achieve an outcome that we can convert into a computing language? That would make sense to me. We could force it to represent more with less, meaning faster and more efficient processing. But, if it's truly random (as I currently understand it to be), how would we transform that into something we can utilize? Thanks to anybody in advance who takes the time to answer me.

I know that for example the pilot wave interpretation of quantum mechanics has its own (mathematical) quirks while being equivalent in its results and predictions to the more accepted Copenhagen and many world interpretations. But Pilot waves can explain the phenomenons with much less ""magic"" involved--so there is a chance we do NOT live in a computer simulation with lazy rendering after all...
Essentially, in pilot wave theory you assume a guiding wave plus a particle ""swimming"" on the wave. The particle is what you measure in the end but its position is guided by the wave. So when you gate the path after the particle has passed, you still collapse the wave and alter the particle's path removing observed interference. Problem is, the guiding wave has to propagate instantaneous, but that's easier for my mind to accept than many other theories. And the second big problem is that you cannot prove this interpretation, as you cannot directly prove any other interpretation with the current theory. You can just reject it due to Occam because the math is less elegant.

It sounds like the object has to be 0.3 kelvin before it's put into the device. So you'd think the device would need to be 0.3 kelvin also to not transfer energy. Is the device placed inside of a freezer or something? How does this work? Or does the device cool the object to 290 mK but it just takes a really long time?

At long last, we may be able to predict the success or failure of kegers and Halloween parties. Jokes aside, I could see this model becoming a nifty and evidence based tool for urban planning and development. ";0;9btcop;[]

And apologies if this is completely wrong, I'm not a physicist. Physics is supposed to be how everything exists, isn't it? Like, it's our fundamental understanding of everything. But here's my question. Since there are things that break the laws of physics, then surely our understanding of physics is not sufficient enough? Like I genuinely don't understand why we say things break the laws of physics. On space, there are various structures, including a mass of nebulae, so massive that it's existence shouldn't be possible based on our understanding of physics. Like just because we can't understand it, doesn't mean it shouldn't exist. I know I don't understand half of it, or probably none of it at all, but I'm genuinely curious. So can someone please clarify why things break the laws of physics, and why do we still use the laws of physics, when they've been broken before?;0;m1gyyi;[]

The other guy looks at the 2 slits with a telescope. He might be lightyears away. But as soon as the information comes to him and he knows if the particle went trough slit A or B, the other observer would see a different picture. That would allow information transfer at over light speed, wouldn't it? Because the particles which pass through the slit and go to the screen only take a finite time to get to the first observer.

No quantum physicists would have believed this couldn't be done. Quantum teleportation is very well studied and has been performed in labs all over the world using different methods, whether its done with photons (light), atoms or other means. Quantum teleportation is the spiffy name given to a particularly clever method of transferring a quantum state from one particle to another using entangled particles as intermediaries (its not as exciting as it sounds, until you learn more about quantum mechanics; it then becomes more exciting). The difference with these groups is that they performed this experiment with photons that they first passed through a relatively long fiber optic cable. The experiment has been done before with one of the photons passing through a fiber optic cable; in this case both photons did. It may sound underwhelming, but its an important milestone towards connecting distant quantum networks. It does not, however, change our understanding of entanglement, causality or physics in general. ";0;53k53g;[]

there's a lot in there that's a lot more subtle and depends precisely on which space we're talking about (de sitter space, anti desitter space, real space...) that I have not satisfactorily described but I believe this to be the essence of the argument
it would be very interesting to see whether the ultra diffuse galaxy lacking dark matter mentioned elsewhere in the thread is above or below this acceleration scale, which presumably is how it was inferred no dark matter exists in that galaxy, though someone more familiar with the matter can perhaps elaborate on how that conclusion was drawn";0;8hr8en;[]

>Abstract
>>Although complex numbers are essential in mathematics, they are not needed to describe physical experiments, as those areexpressed in terms of probabilities, hence real numbers. Physics, however, aims to explain, rather than describe, experiments through theories. Although most theories of physics are based on real numbers, quantum theory was the first to be formulated in terms of operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces. This has puzzled countless physicists, including the fathers of the theory, for whom a real version of quantum theory, in terms of real operators, seemed much more natural. In fact, previous studies have shown that such areal quantum theory can reproduce the outcomes of any multipartite experiment, as long as the parts share arbitrary real quantum states. Herewe investigate whether complex numbers are actually needed in the quantum formalism. We show this to be case by proving that real and complex Hilbert-space formulations of quantum theory make different predictions in network scenarios comprising independent states and measurements. This allows us to devise a Bell-like experiment, the successful realization of which would disprove real quantum theory, in the same way as standard Bell experiments disproved local physics.

[Ruling out real-valued standard formalism of quantum theory](
>ABSTRACT
Standard quantum theory was formulated with complex-valued Schrdinger equations, wave functions, operators, and Hilbert spaces. Previous work attempted to simulate quantum systems using only real numbers by exploiting an enlarged Hilbert space. A fundamental question arises: are the complex numbers really necessary in the standard formalism of quantum theory? To answer this question, a quantum game has been developed to distinguish standard quantum theory from its real-number analogue, by revealing a contradiction between a high-fidelity multi-qubit quantum experiment and players using only real-number quantum theory. Here, using superconducting qubits, we faithfully realize the quantum game based on deterministic entanglement swapping with a state-of-the-art fidelity of 0.952. Our experimental results violate the real-number bound of 7.66 by 43 standard deviations. Our results disprove the real-number formulation and establish the indispensable role of complex numbers in the standard quantum theory.

[Operational Resource Theory of Imaginarity](
>>Wave-particle duality is one of the basic features of quantum mechanics, giving rise to the use of complex numbers in describing states of quantum systems and their dynamics and interaction. Since the inception of quantum theory, it has been debated whether complex numbers are essential or whether an alternative consistent formulation is possible using real numbers only. Here, we attack this long-standing problem theoretically and experimentally, using the powerful tools of quantum resource theories. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, quantum states are easier to create and manipulate if they only have real elements. This gives an operational meaning to the resource theory of imaginarity. We identify and answer several important questions, which include the state-conversion problem for all qubit states and all pure states of any dimension and the approximate imaginarity distillation for all quantum states. As an application, we show that imaginarity plays a crucial role in state discrimination, that is, there exist real quantum states that can be perfectly distinguished via local operations and classical communication but that cannot be distinguished with any nonzero probability if one of the parties has no access to imaginarity. We confirm this phenomenon experimentally with linear optics, discriminating different two-photon quantum states by local projective measurements. Our results prove that complex numbers are an indispensable part of quantum mechanics.";0;rhooth;[]

This assumption rules out, for example, the idea that the universe can split, with different outcomes being observed in different parallel universes
&#x200B;
Theory of mind essentially breaks this axiom outright.
&#x200B;
If the quantum state of a system is set before an observation is made, in which the ground state of the observer is inconsistent with the true nature of the system, then the observation will always be incongruent with the system.
&#x200B;
Case and point: &#x200B;
An unbiased jury, free from the knowledge of the case being tried, is essentially a twelve person quantum computer set to task of observing a system after the collapse of its quantum state. The evidence and facts of the case are weighed by each juror to quantify the implication it will have on their individual verdict. When the case is over and the jury goes into deliberation, the outcome is still in a super position of guilty/innocent regardless of the fact that the officers who arrested the individual believed there to be sufficient evidence for a guilty verdict.
If a juror is not aware of the full extent of the legal framework the case is being tried against, what constitutes a breach of the legal framework, hides bias about the case during jury selection, or otherwise begins the trial in a state other than seeking to find the truth and judge the situation as succinctly to the letter of the law as possible or spirit of the law where instructed by the judge, then the verdict will be incongruent with reality.
Outrage mobs and protests are as real as society can get to an incongruity between the ground states of observers and the implications of personal opinion over dissemination of facts.";0;ijeucg;[]

> Read the article asshat
Kudos for not putting up a paywall article. So I decided to give it a read. Few choice quotes:
> The rise of quantum computing may...
The word ""may"" is a qualifier to keep people from commiting when they are on shaky ground. From a statistical standpoint, a room full of typewriters and chimpanzees MAY produce the complete works of Shakespeare, it is just damned unlikely.
> Public key cryptography based on the RSA standard has been in use since the late 1970s. Each user has a public key for purposes of identification, and a private key
Bitcoin doesn't use RSA. It uses ECDSA which is different on very fundamental levels.
> The public key is based on two very large prime numbers, which are secret; only the recipient knows the prime numbers, which are required to decrypt the message. Factoring extremely large numbers into primes, decrypting the private key requires factoring extremely large numbers into primes, something that takes supercomputers a very long time to do.
Bitcoin obscures public keys behind quantum-proof SHA256 / RIPEMD160. Only those who perform address reuse (spending) would even be applicable to the theories laid out in this article.
> When they give you the money, they give it to an address, Ding said. The address is a short form of your public key.
Guy clearly doesn't know that bitcoin addresses are hashes-of-keys, not keys
> Taproot creates an interface between Bitcoin and ordinary cash transactions
WTF?!?... Taproot has nothing to do with linkages to FIAT banking.

> quantum random number generators are complex, expensive devices
No they aren't. Ones that will go at high speed and be proof against people in possession of the device from interfering with it are expensive. Ones that will give you a stream appropriate for use in a cell phone (i.e., tens of bits per second) are pennies. You don't need megabits of key material to secure an email.
Typical science reporting.
The actual interesting breakthrough is the realization that you have 8 million quantum processors in parallel. That's kind of clever. All the hype about how they've finally solved the world's shortage of random numbers is just hype.

> However, the lack of objectivity revealed by a Bell-Wigner test does not arise in anyones consciousness, but between the recorded facts. Because quantum theory does not distinguish between information recorded in a microscopic system (such as our photonic memory) and in a macroscopic system, the conclusions are the same for both.
They say that:
> the violation of inequality implies that at least one of the three assumptions of free choice, locality, and observer-independent facts must fail. [..] A compelling way to accommodate our result is then to proclaim that facts of the world can only be established by a privileged observere.g., one that would have access to the global wavefunction in the many worlds interpretation or Bohmian mechanics. Another option is to give up observer independence completely by considering facts only relative to observers, or by adopting an interpretation such as QBism, where quantum mechanics is just a tool that captures an agents subjective prediction of future measurement outcomes.
All of this depends on the validity of current quantum mechanical descriptions:
> An observer W observes another observer F who performs a quantum measurement on a physical system. The two observers then formulate a statement about the physical system's state after the measurement according to the laws of quantum theory. However, in most of the interpretations of quantum theory, the resulting statements of the two observers contradict each other. That is, ""most of the interpretations of quantum theory"" give the wrong answer when applied to this situation. [see here]( These theories play out in the conventioanl 4D space time in which we are embedded.

If a measure (at same time) is observed by two persons from the same photon - could this just be a mistake in the test setting, where the observation 1 is marked to occur first but it didnt.
Then the observation 2 that was made actually at same time, is considered to happen later (the wave function collapse) which actually just meant that the objective reality isnt objective at all.
Two measures at same time from same object.
Different results does not mean that time is moving backwards although it might seem like that position and extrapolation wise?
It sounds like the moment of time draws boundries where eg. the electron cloud can exist.
If you take single measurements from a single electron, you could think that it moved back in time although it actually was just measured at a different position at the same time.

The author lost me in the first paragraph. Imagine this was my father and a different woman from my mother. Then I wouldnt exist to go on a coffee date with some one else to change my course of history, and that of my potential children.

Also the Bose Einstein condensate ""matter laser"" can be used to make super sensitive interferometers for use in hunting for gravitational waves and the like. This is all way too exciting!

There's a lot of confused discussion in the top comments, including a lot of deleted stuff. I've studied this field for a while, so I'm hoping to clarify a few things.
First, the title is quite definitely misleading. What is ""reliable"" teleportation? People have been doing quantum teleportation experiments for some time, so are those experiments somehow unreliable?
If you read between the lines a little in the article, the author is contrasting the usual experiments (i.e. using lasers across large distances) with work going on in Delft involving nitrogen vacancy centres in diamonds. The contrast is in something called post-selection.
Entanglement is necessary for quantum teleportation. To create entangled light, you need to send your beam through something called a parametric down-converter. A parametric down-converter is a non-linear crystal that has a small probability of converting one photon into two. By conservation of spin and momentum, these two photons are entangled with respect to these variables. This means, of course, that you need to produce a lot of light for very little entanglement. You can just throw away all the light that didn't get down-converted, a process called post-selection. It is in this sense that the author is describing the usual methods as ""unreliable"".
I haven't read the actual Science paper that this article is hyping (yes, it's hyping, and it's an unfortunate aspect of the business end of science that scientists must develop a relationship with the press in order to help secure funding). But going by what the [group in question]( says on its website, the work being described is basically a technical achievement. No one is sure what technology will be used for commercial quantum information processors, and NV-centres in diamond is one promising piece of what is likely to be a complex and expensive whole. Teleportation is one of the foundational quantum information processing protocols, so showing that it can be done with a candidate technology is an important achievement. It's being done without post-selection, just like everything else in NV-centres. This is not a particularly remarkable achievement.
None of this has anything to do with Einstein. Einstein raised objections to quantum theory based on his particular philosophy of physics, which many people happen to share and most people would describe as intuitive. It has been known for a long time, however, that Einstein was fundamentally if subtly mistaken. Bohr was eminently capable of proving Einstein wrong, more than anyone in history.

>A second light grating to recombine the paths was randomly added, which led to constructive or destructive interference as if the atom had travelled both paths. When the second light grating was not added, no interference was observed as if the atom chose only one path.
>However, the random number determining whether the grating was added was only generated after the atom had passed through the crossroads.

The point is to send data from A to B and 100% confident that the data has not been read by someone else (C for example). Data not read by C would mean a pair of photons would be still be entangled. If C read it before it reaches B, then B would receive a photon that is already disentangled and B will know that the communication channel has been compromised.
At present, quantum communication is used for sending encryption keys only. These keys are used to encrypt the highspeed data over regular networks. So that means A and B actually send most data via our beloved internet/intranet, after they have negotiated encryption keys over secure quantum channel.
The whole reasoning here is that if you require the most secure communication, you may have to step away from TLS and TLS-related crypto libraries (i.e. OpenSSL) that may have been backdoored.
The news today is akin to making a network switch that doesn't alter the entanglement of the photons and can still route via the right fiber cable to the destination. Imagine A, B, C, D, E, F need to talk to each other. Without the switch, everyone will need to have 5 fiber cables. However, with such a switch, everyone will need only 1 fiber cable.";0;n7lzoe;[]

Just a milestone on the road toward a quantum computer that can outperform a classical machine. Saying it is impossible to simulate on classical machines is true but a bit misleading. Quantum computers are very hard to simulate classically but that doesn't mean that a 127-qubit processor can do calculations that a traditional computer can't. It simply means that a classical computer can't emulate what the quantum processor is doing. For those worried about Bitcoin private keys, don't fret. It is estimated a 1500-qubit quantum processor would be needed and whether it actually works practically isn't really known since these larger scale quantum chips can't be simulated. Quantum computing isn't necessarily going to follow Moore's law. It is a wicked engineering problem to keep scaling up which is why, so far, none of the chips have been practically useful.;0;qv4rwc;[]

It's just assuming that there's Dark Matter behind this gravity to call it that. There might be some other cause for the gravity that isn't matter.
It's not right to think about it as dark matter. We should call it dark gravity. They're trying to explain the existence of some unexplained gravity, not necessarily trying to find missing matter.

As Eddington pointed out already before many years, gravitational waves do not have a unique speed of propagation. The speed of the alleged waves is coordinate dependent. A different set of coordinates yields a different speed of propagation and such waves would propagate like the noise.
Relativists use a simplified form of Einstein field equations to calculate various properties of his gravitational field, including Einstein gravitational waves, which are based on the Einstein's pseudo-tensor. This simplified form is called the linearised field equations. They do this because Einstein's field equations are highly non-linear (implicit actually) and impossible to solve analytically. So they use the linearized form, simply assuming that they can do so. However Hermann Weyl proved in 1944 already, that linearization of the field equations implies the existence of a Einstein's pseudo-tensor that doesn't otherwise exist.
The conceptual problem of gravitational waves definition is, the gravitational wave is formed with curvature of space-time and the position of artifacts in general relativity is defined only with respect to curvature of space-time (the flat space-time poses no reference frame for definition of location). In such way the position of gravitational wave is defined it's own position, which leads into circular reasoning of its existence.";0;kdlov;[]

Certain photosynthetic bacteria may have shown the ability to interact with superpositioned photons. This is evident by photon particles still being observed while photosynthetic processes are occurring.

A 50 qbit device wil not be ""milliosn fo times faster"" than anything classical, and we have no idea how to write algorithms to make use of it even if it works. I'm not running down what is undoubtedly a technical tour de force, but people misunderstand quantum computing. First, we don't even know if the principle works or not. If it does, what it *does not* do is ""run many calculations in parallel"". It is designed so that the wave functions of solutions that are not correct interfere and so are not realised, whilst those which are nearly or actually correct are interfere constructively and collapse to an answer. There are very few algorithms that can do this, and they are intensely specific. Factoring of primes is an example of this. There is no sense in which quantum computers are capable of general computing, or can be organised into logic gates. John Preskil came up with the idea of ""quantum supremacy"" in 2011. This refers to the possibility of a demostrable quantum computing solution that classical computing cannot match. The demonstration would cast doubt on one of the foundational tenets of computer science, the Extended [Church-Turing Thesis]( - that computability is limited to a specific class of problem. To date, no ""supremacy"" has been shown. Indeed, as I understand it, the computations that emerge from ""quantum"" computers can equally be understood as classical shuttings about. That's not to say that QC may not one day work. But what that ""working"" entails may be far more narrow that the enthusiasts are inclined to claim. ";0;5xt03g;[]

To over simplify: Quantum teleportation does transfer information instantly - it just can't be read instantly. When measured, the information is transferred ""faster"" (it's instant) than the speed of light - the speed of light is not the restriction on (quantum) information transfer, but on how quick we can interpret that information. MIND BLOWN! yes, it's that awesome.
Basically, some quantum information is ""transferred"" instantly, but needs a ""key"" (a piece of classical information) to be sent classically (effectively at a speed less than speed of light) in order to interpret that quantum information. The key can be as little as two bits classical information - something as simple as a flashing light. (aside: quantum information is about the spin directions of measured particles (which can encode complex information) - and in the future, maybe larger objects)
So say, you had a severe electrical storm between your satellite and your base on venus, and you wanted to send some complex information from the base to the satellite. You worried complex information sent directly through the storm would be scrambled - so you use quantum teleportation to change the states of some quantum system on the satellite from the base, then send a 2 bit key by a flashing laser from the base (much more likely to be interpreted correctly through the storm) in order to decode the complex information that had been sent. and viola! Quantum Teleportation for the win. (kinda stole this example from Penrose - road to reality)
NOTE! nothing is being teleported like in star trek - think of it as instant bluetooth that needs a infarred (different type of information transfer) key to be sent in order to interpret it.
Also, ""transferred"" here is misleading, as it's a philosophical question as to whether two entangled particles can be considered as separate entities from this perspective. AND IT'S AN AWESOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION! but not as misleading as saying ""at the speed of light"" as instant is effectively much quicker than that. FUN FUN FUN!

Right off the bat they treat a macroscopic object (a photodetector) as if it were a quantum object (in superposition and entangled to other quantum objects). That's not how any of this works. In order to make the photodetector a quantum object, they would need to successfully causally isolate it on a completely unprecedented scale (the photodetector would amount to constructing a quantum system of as many atoms as make up the detector, while we currently struggle to get systems of even a few tens of atoms to be isolated) - they mentioned no argument as to why their photodetector might be isolated enough to consider as a quantum system and instead just blindly perform the thought experiment as described in plain language. I'm not certain why they get the answer they do yet - I would need to take a closer look at the possible biases in the experimental methods - but their treatment of the photodetector is so wrong that I'm certain it's either a fabricated result or else there's an experimental flaw giving the biased answer. (Am on my phone rn, so can't dig into the rest of their methods rn).
We all live in the macro world. The probabilistic outcomes of the quantum world average themselves out via collapse and entanglement on our scales, so that we will agree on facts about the world on macro (and even quantum scales once we measure them) unless someone succeeds at isolating systems as large as people - something that probably isn't possible for millenia at least, if at all. This kind of psuedo-quantum factual-relativism is bunk.
Edit: thinking a bit about it, I'm pretty sure the result they do get is just a typical nonlocality result with extra mess from the weird assumption about the photodetectors being isolated. In which case, this definitely doesn't mean anything about reality being subjective and is a typical result which shows their initial photon source was in fact producing entangled photon pairs (which isn't a surprise).
Edit 2: in fact, nonlocality and entanglement can be thought of as a way to enforce consistency between isolated observers when they check answers with each other. If an observer isolated from me measures a spin, that observer becomes entangled - from my perspective - with the spin state (think about the case where they write down their result as a spin). If I then measure the spin, I can tell you what the other observer measured because I know they're entangled with it/ observed an outcome. Likewise if I ask them what they measured, I also know the spin state, again, because it's entangled with them. Entanglement ensures consistency rather than cause subjectivity or inconsistency.";0;dwz9ks;[]

- If the act of changing it changes it, and the act of looking changes it, how do they verify? Do they change something, wait a certain amount of time, and see if its pair changed as expected by looking? If that's the case, how is real time data sent? I mean wouldn't that defeat the purpose of the increased speed?
- How are quantum computers faster than normal machines, exactly? All the explanations I've seen don't make any sense. Even before an explanation one of the first things I think of with quantum entanglement is ""one-off"" meaning it's not reusable...

They don't measure and get different results. One person measures and gets a result, and the other checks if the system is still in super position, via interference patterns. The observer who has measured a result becomes part of the system in super position from the reference frame of the other observer. The only way this boils down to irreconcilable differences in objective reality is if when the outside observer takes a final measurement, if they don't match up. Until this result can be found it's just a loaded deck. ;0;b090x7;[]

However, many experts -- including Scott Aaronson (who is mentioned in the article) -- have cast doubt on D-Wave's claims, because the company has not yet proved that its machines are producing results by exploiting quantum phenomena like particle entanglement and superposition. In other words, D-Wave's devices may very well be different, but still classical, computers. D-Wave's engineers acknowledge as much: they are quoted in the article stating that ""they don't yet know for sure what's happening inside the chip.""

No one doubted, that this would be the outcome. It is consistent with how we think about quantum theory. However, a definitive proof in the form of this kind of loop hole free test just hadnt been done, and was thought to be very challenging to do. So what we learn from this is that we can continue as we were, which by itself is not spectacular, but still very important. ;0;3iso3v;[]

If we were to create a stream of photons and anti-photons (or any particle and its generated opposite) in an accelerator, stream the first particle set in the accelerator in a loop and send anti-particles toward the target destination, then we should, by changing the polarity of the first particle set one particle at a time, be able to note the immediate change in the polarity of the received particle as a sort of binary code.
Think of it as + + - - + + (or whatever), giving us a binary information set. We know that when you create particles and their anti-particles in an accelerator and change the polarity of the first, the second changes instantly with no ""speed of light"" limitations on the (what I call) quantum information bundle. So with a proper stream of anti-particles to a destination and a cycling supply of particles here, if we could accomplish the engineering I don't see why it isn't possible, from a pure particle physics standpoint, to have instant communication across great distances.

So to me this seems like saying: we performed an experiment. That experiment completed faster than we could have simulated it.
While nice. It isn't very surprising. For example. I can claim I made a device that calculates the minimal surface area containing a given volume. And it does so faster than any computer does.
Without context maybe that sounds interesting. But in reality all I did was blow bubbles onto volumes. (They minimize surface area).
If this problem they solved was not immediately related to quantum mechanics then that's be impressive.
For now it is just a good proof of concept.";0;dlwaxv;[]

This experiment was done with phosphorous atoms in a solid. In order to actually use those atoms as quantum bits (qubits) you have to be able to control them and have them interact with one another. Long life time and strong coupling are at odds with one another. To get strong coupling you need your qubit to have enough electric or magnetic field to be felt by the thing with which you want it to interact. On the other hand if the qubit interacts with stuff you didn't intend then you get bad coherence.
Atoms are really small and have weak electromagnetic properties. This makes it relatively easy to get high coherence times, but really really hard to get good coupling. A practical quantum computer must negotiate this trade-off properly.

The math of multiple universes existing simultaneously is purely speculative and breaks down. I am no quantum theorist but based on my reading of Unger/Smolin the scientist quoting that the math makes it possible is taking some big leaps. The alternative, that I find more compelling as an argument, is that there are likely multiple universes, but they occur in succession. Evolving and changing over time. This is supported by the fact that we know certain static laws of the universe (gravity, weak/strong nuclear) existed in different forms than they do know moments after the big bang. They evolved. They changed. It's a fun thought excercise to imagine multiple universal yous, but personally I think it subtracts from the message of the genuine power of the moment here and now.;0;dlvjor;[]

Actually, they proved that their machine can more or less randomly change from one quantum state to another faster than a classical computer could simulate it more or less randomly changing from one quantum state to another.
I'll believe all this - And although difficult in practice the theory behind quantum computing is pretty sound - when they can factor a large number randomly chosen by someone else, then do the same thing again, then do the same thing again.
Oh, and that figure of 10K years? It looks like that's how long it would take a conventional machine to simulate the quantum machine *if programmed to do so the least efficient way possible*.

Then I looked back to older issues, and flying cars have been 10 years away since the 1920s.

Researchers are making a counter-intuitive claim: reality itself may be subjective, thanks to quantum weirdness on a microscopic scale.
In a new paper in the journal Science Advances, an international team of quantum physicists argue that thanks to the unusual rules of quantum mechanics, facts themselves could depend on who's looking at them.
On a quantum level, it's long been understood that particles can be in several states at once.
In an experimental test at the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, the researchers built a small-scale quantum computer.
Their aim was to scientifically prove that measurements in quantum mechanics are actually subjective to a particular observer.
""Eventually, we succeeded in showing that quantum mechanics might indeed be incompatible with the assumption of objective facts - we violated the inequality!"" lead researchers Alessandro Fedrizzi and Massimiliano Proietti, quantum physicists at Heriot-Watt University, wrote in a recent piece for The Conversation.
""The insight we gained is that quantum observers may indeed be entitled to their own facts,"" wrote Fedrizzi in a September statement.";0;dwz9ks;[]

When they become available (in a few decades) open source bitcoin will have adjusted its protocol long in advance. Bitcoin is antifragile, the more is attacked, the stronger it gets. And when the age comes where quantum computers ARE a threat, both the bad guys and the good guys, and the average citizen, will have them. It'll be much like it is now. Most progress made in the hardware industry is pretty linear. Worrying about quantum computers right now is certainly a waste of energy, given that quantum computers are still in their infantile stages, and can only operate at absolute zero temperatures. (Hint: It's an extremely difficult job to find a way to bring absolute zero cooling methods to the consumer market.). While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography.
Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC. Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat.

Verse 15) The first reality before time was God, but only God was there at the beginning. The Word of God was God from the beginning. To create the environment for all existence, an excellent and robust structure was necessary. To demonstrate proportionality between the Creator and creation the control of that structure was given to the preincarnate Christ who made all things. In the beginning of time, was the infinity of time but this sovereign simplicity was concealed so that a certain delineation of time might be perceived by all creation through the expansion in the fabric of Spacetime. Every physical property was made obedience to the creator as moving forward in single four-dimensional continuum. This spacetime is closely associated with Jesus who holds everything together (The Word of God). Logos introduced by the Greek philosophers and derived from the Greek language can be view as more than just the expression Word (r/, 2015). In the original Greek the meaning of Logos was intrinsic to the Greek philosophers because it represented to their audience the supportive evidence to their logical structure. The Greek people wanted to only apply reason to Gods grace and thought the message of the Cross was foolishness. During Christs ministry to his Jewish brotherhood was such a robust and excellent augment established for mankinds inadequacy to earn Gods approval due to the overwhelming desire for peer praise. Nevertheless, the Pharisee of that time where necessary to frustrate the message of Grace so that prophesy would be fulfilled (Moses). The seven woes were the last address Jesus gave to a mixed public audience (Matthew). In the effectiveness of omnipresence, God clearly explains the results that will occur to a disobedient generation which research and know the mind of God without surrendering to His whole will. This exposure to the truth invites intellectual pride and hubris because without combining knowledge with faith we cannot discern divine-spiritual truths.
For when the hostility between God and His redeemed was validated by the sacrificial act of Christ on the cross, Paradise was opened. This was made possible by Jesus Christ who after scorning the shame of mankinds sin the dividing curtain from holiness was sheared from top to bottom. By this one-time act of Logos was the summation of Christs mortality as the Son of Man was not overshadowed by His eternal Name above all names. Consequently, there is presently only one Heavenly Priest and King sitting at Gods right hand preparing an expanding Kingdom of both Jews and Gentiles to become ""permanent"" citizens of His house for eternity. Because of the awakening of mankinds awareness to the Gentiles opportunity for salvation, the Jews and the Greeks introduces heresies as to add adherence to Gods Logos. For the Jews realized after the apostle Peters sermon at Pentecost that there was an additional moment of time to receive the Spirit of God and avoid damnation. But for the Gentiles this became evident in the same book of Acts by the story of Pauls Road to Damascus . In modern terms it might be used as a persuasive technique in writing or rhetoric to give an audience context to the individuals own creative thinking. Unfortunate for humanity, false Christs are the structured-appeal to take captive our comprehension for self-interest sake so that we achieve an allusion of salvation counter to the properties of God. More than likely, the human bent is distorted by another voice of reason with promises that appeal to our own weak sin nature. This contradictory message away from the truth is due to the sin nature becoming dominate in our modern age. This human logos or false Christ is anything counter-intuitive to Gods own self-interest (Logos) as to render the human logos a pathway to unholiness, sin, and finally the ultimate death. The majestic countdown clock from a mortal perspective was activated and there was light. For God so loved mankind as to prepare six iterations of time marked with a seventh reiteration of time. A seventh state of existence in which time over time is made manifest to reveal Gods good will. His will was to create a period of rest in which to prepare His bride who would first suffer sins dominate power before a stage of repentance. Therefore, the awakening.
This temporary rest, which was caused by death was not the final state of rest because mankind is predestined to live again. From the eternal viewpoint of God, the consequences sin is death but for the glory of God, mankind sins where not beyond the Grace of God. At just the right time Jesus Christ being God conquered the consequences of sin at the Cross by shedding His blood to redeem the whole Israel once and for all as His bride. Therefore, God has pre-established a solution for the final rest for His eternal heavenly family through a personal relationship with the faith that is found in Jesus Christ. All others who have lived without this saving faith fall short of the gift of Gods grace. For the love of Jesus Christ and Gods sacrificial act of redemptive love has been rejected along with the blaspheming the Holy Spirit. This type do not have their name written into the book of life. Plainly stated is that the varying velocity of Gods will be done is a fallacy embraced by mankind because we can only have reference relative to our viewpoint. God is not slow to act, although this may not be easily accepted from a human perspective, because that sovereign will be a supreme power under divide guidance. What if Gods prerogative was to permit another slave axis within its own domain as an expression of sternness from the Master to the slave. Imagine this obfuscation of the universes design perplexed the darkest which enabled evils predestined existence to live in duplicity with the objects of loving-light. Neither angel or man these powers and principalities rejected Gods Spirit and try to replace the exclusive right to fill mankinds conscience like the carbon monoxide molecule fills the red blood cell instead of the oxygen. We only wish to understand logos, but without Logos, everyone fall short of God's glory.";0;9l1wd9;[]

Could these particles be used to move, say, two hinges in the exact same way? If so, do they carry more weight since resistance to the force literally doubles?
If theyre purely or at least readable in change, what all can change? Could we use them for drones cameras or downloading data at a distance? Is quantum internet feasible?
Is it possible to entangle more than two atoms?
Can the connection be broken?
Anyone with any answers would be much appreciated.";0;vu7s81;[]

This is not a natural expectation for me, so I decided to look at [the actual paper]( instead of the press release. Surprisingly, the argument looks valid (though not sound) on a first glance. I'll summarize it for the benefit of others here:
1. Assume global causal order is not the case.
2. Assume standard quantum formalism only holds locally.
3. [insert complex math I skimmed through and assume is correct here]
4. The math is consistent with nonstandard global causes, such as described in the press release.
While this argument is by no means cogent due to sketchy premises, it is nevertheless an amazing finding in my opinion. I guess I just always assumed that the math *required* a global causal order, but this result shows that there is no contradiction from ""a causing b causing a"" scenarios.
Compare this to similarly famous discoveries showing that nothing inherently prevents time travel. It doesn't mean time travel (or alternate causal orders) must be possible, but it does open up the possibility given today's understanding of QM.";0;10vxar;[]

Several billion years later the universe is expanding faster and faster. So now we come up with dark energy to account for that. Maybe gravity is a force that pushes instead of pulling. It exists in the vacuum of space and matter disrupts the force of gravity with anti-gravity, or a weakening of gravity, and that is why the universe is expanding faster the the more empty space it gets.
Perhaps the universes surrounding our universe exert so much gravity that the closer matter gets to those universes the faster it accelerates.

Yes, the electron has a state before you measure it. However, there's no way to know what that is until you measure it. When we say state here we mean it's spinning around and atom one way or the other.
You sort of have to understand how ludicrously tiny electrons are for this to make sense, and how fast they're whipping about. That's why we describe them as energy levels. The old ""model of an electron"" with a visible orbit is actually silly. It would be more accurate to describe a spherical blur around the nucleus; that's how fast they're going.
Anyway at that scale in order to observe or ""measure"" which way the electron is moving, the only way we know how to do that is going to fuck with the electron. Stop telling people electrons don't have a spin state until they're measured. That's just disingenuous. Of course they do. That state is totally meaningless to us though unless we can ever figure out a way to measure it without interfering. I'm a science fiction writer. Is my understanding far off base?";0;26u06z;[]

I didn't expect our work to spark such a discussion. Given the many questions and speculations, I would like to join and try to offer some clarifications to the best of my capabilities.
In fact, some comments got very close to the actual content of the paper. In particular, the interpretation of our result as a situatiotoin of the kind |A causes B> + |B causes A> is possibly among the best possible. However... there is a however :). Imagine tossing a coin, if head comes out, you arrange your experiment such that A causes B, if tail is the result, you arrange B causes A. (A and B are operations that produce measurement results and that can influence each other, for example the measurement of a photon's polarization followed by the preparation of a new polarization state. If A is first B will measure the polarization prepared in A and the other way around). This is perfectly fine with classical physics and causal order: the two possibilities simply take place with 50% probability.
Now imagine a quantum version of this: a ""quantum coin"" can be in a superposition |head> + |tail> (the favorite choice where I come from is a photon on a beam-splitter, but any other quantum system would serve the purpose). If, as before, you have an experimental arrangement such that ""if head than A causes B"" and ""if tail than B causes A"", you end up in a situation that you can describe as |head>|A causes B> + |tail>|B causes A>. This is (almost) standard quantum mechanics, which can be realized in the lab. There are in fact some cute things one can do with such a state, on which we are working at the moment. (""Almost"" because traditionally operations are put in a causal sequence by construction, so this situation would be phrased in a slightly different, more complicated way.)
Is this what we are talking about in our work? Well, actually... no. The problem is that, in the example above, the causal relation can be known by measuring the ouctome of the coin toss (head or tail). It turns out that, if you only consider the events A and B, the measurement results are indistinguishable from the classical situation described at the beginning: each of the two possibilities happens with 50% probability. Is a ""genuine"" situation ""|A causes B> + |B causes A>"" possible at all? We found that it is possible, but one needs to ""stretch"" a little more the standard quantum formalism so that it can describe all situations where the order of events is not pre-defined. In the resulting formalism the expression ""|A causes B> + |B causes A>"" doesn't make sense any more as a sum in a vector space, but there is something that very much resembles it. Still, if in the experiment you simply ask the question ""wihch one was first"", you will find one of the two possibilties with 50% probability. However, if you ask a different kind of question (a specific set of measurements at A and B, a sort of two-player game), one finds that no probabilistic mixture of the two orders can describe what's going on. The ""stretching"" of the theory is a minimal one: everything is exactly as in quantum mechanics, except for the order of events (and standard quantum mechanics is retreived once a definte order is imposed).
Does all this have anything to do with nature? We are not sure. However, we already know situations in general relativity that challenge the idea of events-ordering. When combined with quantum mechanics, there are no clear reasons not to expect situations similar to ours to appear. However, since no consistent theory of quantum gravity exists yet, we cannot give a definite answer as of yet.
Our results are sometimes interpreted as a version of quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping, interference in time, double-time formulation of quantum mechanics and similar. The key difference is that the notion of ""causal order"" we refer to relays on actual signalling: ""A causes B"" means that the outcome observed in B depends on the choice of which operation is performed at A. In contrast, the ""quantum retrocausality"" often mentioned is an interpretation, based on specific assumptions, of correlations that don't allow any exchange of information. I apologize for the length of the post, but I hope you will find it useful.

The lab was only 2 years old, but my partner and I had the strongest statistical significance reported.
I still have a bunch of docs from the lab if anyone is interested. Unfortunately I did this lab as a oral presentation, so I didn't write anything up afterwards aside from my measurements.

There is some trickery that can be done with single photon states, but that requires optical qnd measurements, which are still very difficult to produce, and have loss rates that are too high. This means that these systems are limited to classical repeaters and the BB84, scheme which is the most brittle, lacks a lot of security properties you might want, due to the high loss. What is really wanted is the use of the E91 protocol. And that requires either repeaters every 15 or so km. Much power loss repeaters, or moving quantum states in a way other than optic fibres.
So this is awesome work, but still very very limited in applicability. And does not really help the quantum internet, just qkd, and that use is limited.";0;ny3g3u;[]

That is, the ""arrow of time"" (where billiard balls go in direction of disordered looking vs ordered looking), is purely an outcome of ""ordered looking"" states being far less/rare compared to the ""disordered looking"" states (which to a human may look all the same ie total disordered, but which each are unique in their own way).
As a result when we progress from an ordered state, it almost always seems to go towards disorder from an initial ordered state.
And this is the seeming ""arrow of time"". Basically only practically observable usually only when an outside agent is able to coerce a system into one of those very few ""ordered looking"" states (which would be rare if system was on it's own).

If a close-up of that event is recorded with a camera and played in reverse, it can still be represented by the same equation. Moreover, it is not possible to distinguish from the recording if it has been doctored. Both versions look plausible. It would appear that the billiard balls defy the intuitive sense of time.

>Quantum physicists from MIPT decided to check if time could spontaneously reverse itself at least for an individual particle and for a tiny fraction of a second. That is, instead of colliding billiard balls, they examined a solitary electron in empty interstellar space.
I don't fully understand this study's result - whether the system transitioned to a more ""ordered looking"" configuration because of some constrained dynamics or what.

I feel like most people didn't bother. >The researchers observed the atoms under a microscope by illuminating them with a separate imaging laser. A light microscope can't see individual atoms, but the imaging laser causes them to fluoresce, and the microscope captured the flashes of light. When the imaging laser was off, or turned on only dimly, the atoms tunneled freely. But as the imaging beam was made brighter and measurements made more frequently, the tunneling reduced dramatically.
So basically, you have to shine a laser at them, and the intensity of the laser changes their movement... So it's pretty obvious that ""watching"" is not referring to the human concept of watching, but quite literally a laser beam affecting these which is part of the process we use to make measurements. I don't know about you but this stuff isn't as hard when you move the fancy jargon out of the way.
Edit: just want to point out, don't let my oversimplification fool you. it's freaking amazing that we can even influence small clusters of atoms like this. Just think about how complex this setup is.

I find this hard to accept, if only because it is provable that time passes slower at higher altitude/lower gravity - if you have two atomic clocks and put one at the top of a mountain, the mountain clock will measure less time passing when you reunite them. There was also the study NASA did with twins where one went to the ISS for a year (although I don't remember what the conclusions from that were).

The seeming incompatibility of the results have to do with the fact that this article considers quantum computers without errors, whereas the current quantum computers we are building have a lot of small errors, that eventually add up and give you nonsense. However, we've known for a long time that given a large enough QC we can correct these errors at a constant computational cost.
Now, this article is still very nice, because unlike other ""proofs"" of quantum advantage it doesn't rely on assumptions about the hardness of particular problems.

Such instances exist but only in super-world. The world that we know today does not support such conditions where the super-quantum laws of physics can exist. Physics is dependent on the matter and it's substance and there co-relation with the existing environment. For cause to be equally relevant with the effect at all times(past, present, future) it will have to exceed it's own existing self and will have to be in that state at all times. Surprisingly there is no such matter except soul. The sole reason behind it is that the matter should have the consciousness to enable it to be in super-Quanta state at all times to make effect and cause resembling at all times.

It seems some people would like to know what's going on with quantum teleportation.
It is conceivable that quantum teleportation could one day be very similar to teleportation of science fiction, but you gotta do it right. Today's teleportation technology works on single particles. So let's say we want to teleport particle A... What we need is another particle (B) which looks the same as the first one. The act of teleportation is to take the quantum state of particle A and transfer it to particle B. There you go, teleportation done.
But, doesn't that sound like duplication, not teleportation? It does, except for the fact that the state of particle A after teleportation is *fundamentally and necessarily* destroyed. The identity has been transferred from A to B.
You might say ""I don't care, it's just making another thing like the first one, nothing was teleported."" But isn't that good enough? Imagine in the future when this can be done for larger composite objects and we teleport a person. If the entire state of the object is transferred (including the state of the brain which contains all our memories and personality etc.), then isn't that as good as teleporting? (Of course, we don't yet totally understand consciousness, maybe there is more to ourselves then our physical state but bear with me.)
So then the picture you should have is that when something needs to be teleported, you need a dummy object at the receiving end to be ""teleported on to."" Who knows, maybe you can just spray a fine mist of material to be used to recreate the object. Or any teleportation machine would be a 2 step process, replicate, then teleport.
It's a bit unnerving to think of how this works with people, essentially you would make a dead clone of you at the destination. Then you would be killed when your quantum state is sucked out of your body, and your body will be disposed of. Then the quantum state will be inserted into the clone and will pop back into life with all your memories etc. I wonder if it will hurt...";0;c6llq;[]

Quantum magnetism is a bit different from classical magnetism, the kind you see when you stick a magnet to a fridge, because individual atoms have a quality called spin, which is quantized, or in discrete states (usually called up or down). Seeing the behavior of individual atoms has been hard to do, though, because it required cooling atoms to extremely cold temperatures and finding a way to ""trap"" them.
The new finding, detailed in the May 24 issue of the journal Science, also opens the door to better understanding physical phenomena, such as superconductivity, which seems to be connected to the collective quantum properties of some materials. [Twisted Physics: 7 Mind-Blowing Findings]
Spin science
The research team at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich focused on atoms' spin, because that's what makes magnets magnetic all the spins of the atoms in a bar magnet are pointed the same way.
To get a clear view of atoms' spin behaviors, the researchers had to cool potassium atoms to near absolute zero. That way, the random thermal ""noise"" basically background radiation and heat didn't spoil the view by jostling the potassium atoms around.
The scientists then created an ""optical lattice"" a crisscrossing set of laser beams. The beams interfere with each other and create regions of high and low potential energy. Neutral atoms with no charge will tend to sit in the lattice's ""wells,"" which are regions of low energy.
Once the lattice is built, the atoms will sometimes randomly ""tunnel"" through the sides of the wells, because the quantum nature of particles allows them to be in multiple places at the same time, or to have varying amounts of energy. [Quantum Physics: The Coolest Little Particles in Nature]
Another factor that determines where the atoms lie in the optical lattice is their up or down spin. Two atoms can't be in the same well if their spins are the same. That means atoms will have a tendency to tunnel into wells with others that have opposite spins. After a while, a line of atoms should spontaneously organize itself, with the spins in a non-random pattern. This kind of behavior is different from materials in the macroscopic world, whose orientations can have a wide range of in-between values; this behavior is also why most things aren't magnets the spins of the electrons in the atoms are oriented randomly and cancel each other out.
And that's exactly what the researchers found. The spins of atoms do organize, at least on the scale the experiment examined.
""The question is, what are the magnetic properties of these one-dimensional chains?"" said Tilman Esslinger, a professor of physics at ETH whose lab did the experiments. ""Do I have materials with these properties? How can these properties be useful?""
Quantum magnetism
This experiment opens up possibilities for increasing the number of atoms in a lattice, and even creating two-dimensional, gridlike arrangements of atoms, and possibly triangular lattices as well.
One debate among experts is whether at larger scales the spontaneous ordering of atoms would happen in the same way. A random pattern would mean that in a block of iron atoms, for instance, one is just as likely to see a spin up or down atom in any direction. The spin states are in what is called a ""spin liquid"" a mishmash of states. But it could be that atoms spontaneously arrange themselves at larger scales.
""They've put the foundation on various theoretical matters,"" said Jong Han, a professor of condensed matter physics theory at the State University of New York at Buffalo, who was not involved in the research. ""They don't really establish the long-range order, rather they wanted to establish that they have observed a local magnetic order.""
Whether the order the scientists found extends to larger scales is an important question, because magnetism itself arises from the spins of atoms when they all line up. Usually those spins are randomly aligned. But at very low temperatures and small scales, that changes, and such quantum magnets behave differently.
Han noted that such lattices, especially configurations where the potential wells connect to three others, rather than two or four, would be especially interesting. Esslinger's lab showed that atoms tend to jump to potential wells where the spins are opposite; but if the wells are arranged so that the atom can jump to two other atoms, it can't ""choose"" which well to go to because one of the two atoms will always be in the same spin state.
Esslinger said his lab wants to try building two-dimensional lattices and explore that very question. ""What happens to magnetism if I change the geometry? It's no longer clear if spins should be up or down.""";0;1f3tbb;[]

I know we have a lot of trouble measuring particle characteristics and all but I don't see why that means they are always changing for each particle. from wikipeida:
>Bell's theorem and related results rule out a local realistic explanation for quantum mechanics (one which obeys the principle of locality while also ascribing definite values to quantum observables). However, in other interpretations, the experiments that demonstrate the apparent non-locality can also be described in local terms
What's If Bell's theorem is being interpreted too broadly here? Isn't it easier to believe that Quantum theory has some holes in it than to believe in quantum teleportation?

Rydberg polaritons switch continually from light to matter and back again. In Rydberg polaritons, light and matter are like two sides of a coin, and the matter side is what makes polaritons interact with each other.
This interaction is crucial because this is what allows the creation of quantum simulators, a special type of quantum computer, where information is stored in quantum bits. These quantum bits, unlike the binary bits in classical computers that can only be 0 or 1, can take any value between 0 and 1. They can therefore store much more information and perform several processes simultaneously.
This capability could allow quantum simulators to solve important mysteries of physics, chemistry and biology, for example, how to make high-temperature superconductors for highspeed trains, how cheaper fertilizers could be made potentially solving global hunger, or how proteins fold making it easier to produce more effective drugs.";0;u6w5xr;[]

In any case, the article ignores the other side of the equation, which is the charging stations ability to supply current. If you want to charge the battery in half the time you need twice the current. If you want to cut the time from 20 minutes to 1 minute, youd need 20x the charging current. To achieve the charging time these guys are talking about would require so much power that each charging station would potentially require hundreds of kW or even a megawatt of instantaneous power capacity. I dont think our power grid can handle that.;0;tki5ld;[]

Quantum entanglement is critical in the design of quantum computers. Does this imply we could make a Quantom Computer that is stored in multiple, far away, locations? Not that this is desirable per say, but it's neat to think of a giant multi-part calculator that works at the same speed regardless of it's distances apart. Sure, our ability to read it however is sadly still limited by the speed of light (and trains and plains and automobiles), but the concept is super cool to me.
The only practical advantage I can think of is having a complex answer hidden behind the lack of remaining nodes of information. Nuke launch codes, or something so important a single person shouldn't be able to run it.

It blows my mind that you can make a (very simplified) quantum bit flip 20 miles apart, but it's 100% meaningless to the recipient until they are told to look for it. Changing something faster than the speed of light, but in a way that is only useful only at the speed of light.
I don't know if it's feasible to make the system in such a way as to have the recipient ready to know what to look for *before* the message is sent, but is expecting it. In my very limited knowledge this can't be feasible, unless the length limit of quantum entanglement is literally 1 lightyear or less. Otherwise we would be able to send messages to people on the other end of quantum ""phone"" faster than light could get there, so long as we literally went there first. That would be truly ground breaking.
I need to talk to a quantum physicist.

Edit:
My flawed assumption has been found. A quantum bit doesn't show a 1 or a 0. It shows a superposition of 1 through 0. The receiving end can't tell the difference between static noise, and the incoming data unless they have the ""senders"" measurements as well.";0;vu7s81;[]

The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your left? Or the one on your right? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is correct too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute society with the Universe. The correct answer is that It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first. Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then theres no choice but for others to also take the right napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is society Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of right or left?! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who takes the napkin first must be someone who is respected by all. Its not that anyone can fulfill this role Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the losers. In the case of this table, the eldest or the Master of the party will take the napkin first Because everyone respects those individuals.;0;dlvjor;[]

Even if there is a form of cryptology out there that is beyond cracking, at the end of the day you still have to trust the person who gives that encryption technique to you that it is what it says on the tin.
There is a reason why the state has not acted alone: because the cryptology CAN defend itself. So instead, we have the state force corporations to tweak the mathematical methods of that encryption in their favour upon pain of legal fury. And you would be none-the-wiser when Windows demands another OS update at the bottom-right of your screen.
The problem is still at the end of the day, authoritarian power, as it always has been. It is wrong to assume that the internet can bring democracy. Not when China can set up fake-opposition blogs to lure dissenters into a trap where their IPs can be caught and hence be arrested. Not when Islamic fascists can crowdsource YouTube videos to identify street protesters and have the secret police on them. Not when a regime can get desperate and fire rockets into the servers of the ISPs. Not when copyright law still encourages a Luddite backlash from corporations against the decentralisation of data via file-sharing BitTorrents. Not when the revelation of dissenters in Afghanistan fighting against the Taliban can spread around the world within seconds.
What brings about resisting totalitarianism is the old-fashioned stuff: freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, separating religions from the state, revealing who you are to the world and that your name means business (so anonymity is a utopian idea, too), organising marches, breaking certain laws, and of course using military force against your state to bring about a revolution if need be.

Weve been being subtly tricked by the way they report and speak on things. Sure they make items, like chips and motherboards and processors.
But those things come from elements found in nature:
Like for instance lithium I dont think the chip shortage is because of supply chain thats a lie I think, I think its because Africa is slowly becoming more and more independent abd they are taking their resources, which led to china trying to push their way in, which didnt work too well, then all of a sudden, all of these ways to get people into buying gpus became a thing.crypto and nfts.

[Google]( and [Cloudflare]( takes the quantum computing threat seriously along with the [NSA]( and [NIST]( I'd say these are folks that we could pay attention to.
For blockchain projects:
* QRL is natively post-quantum resistant ([Using XMSS, draft recommended by NIST \[pdf\]]( by default.
* QRL will be bringing the option to be post-quantum secure to Ethereum wallets with [enqlave.io]( \- just needs an audit!
* ADA seems interested in it, though opted for ECC for more features.
* Monero is [doing research](
* IOTA has it, but will be [switching to ECC ED25519]( as default for more features.
While quantum computers aren't going to break blockchains today, projects have a lot to do to prepare and it's not as straight forward as one might think as post-quantum crypto is [not likely going to be a drop-in replacement for ECC \[NIST/NCCoE\]]( Even assuming every project flicks a switch and instantly reaches a consensus, integrates everything, tests, audits, and releases their fork which gives the ability for post-quantum addresses, there's still the time to migrate. Seeing as that most are their own bank (not your keys, not your crypto!), only the end user can do their migration, and it can plausibly take a while. I don't recommend it, but conversely, your crypto would be safer on a centralized exchange in this scenario as they have staff on hand to handle the migration! This is the same scenario with banks - which are centralized with IT staff on hand to handle a migration, so also wont have a problem.
How long will it take for individuals to migrate when there's security ramifications? Well, we can take a look at Windows 7, which according to [Net Marketshare](, has a 22% marketshare as of 2020-08, which reached EoL in [2020-01]( This is in spite of the security risk, which Microsoft states clearly: ""Support for Windows 7 ended on January 14, 2020. If you are still using Windows 7, *your PC may become more vulnerable to security risks*"". It should be noted that at the time of that announcement... 26% of people were using Windows 7, so even after nearly a year there's been a change of \~4%.
If it takes 2 years to migrate (low estimate considering the above), then you're really looking at the time that ECC is broken and going backwards in time from that estimate. In this example, if it's broken in 2022, and it takes 2 years to migrate, you should have had post-quantum addresses ready by 2020 to start the migration, and as a friendly reminder that's not including consensus, development, testing, and audits. As certain blockchain features that rely on ECC are more difficult or infeasible to do with post-quantum crypto, this can negatively impact the development and migration timelines. [Quantum attacks on bitcoin, and how to protect against them gave 2027 as an optimistic estimate](
Even with that under consideration, on any given year it's not a 0% or 100% chance of being broken but instead has a cumulative probability. It also doesn't take into account the value of what's being broken. One of our community members put [together a model]( that articulates this. Put another way, is a 1% chance too high, 50%? That's going to depend on each individual and individual project. For 300 Billion of value, I'd like to think 1% is too high, while for a dog house, I doubt I'd even care if it had a 99% probability of being broken - [some dogs might have a different risk tolerance, however](
Michele Mosca, co-founder and deputy director of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, breaks down this risk assessment in [business terms pretty well](";0;ipn127;[]

I don't think a particles super position causes a new universe because it would then need this particles, which would have to be the first in its new universe to be the one to create a new universe and imprint all the position of all the previous particles across the whole universe instantly. How does thins new universe get it's information from the last one if the particles position is what causes the new universe. We've found quantum tunneling and pairity changes still happen at the speed of light so a particle creating a new universe would have to copy all the information from the entire universe instantly to the new universe. More likely particles in superposition do not experience time, like a photon doesn't experience time, it is instantly at its destination from it's frame of reference. A particle going through a double spit goes in all possible directions because a particle in motion isn't like a bowling ball that flies straight, it's more like throwing a balloon, it's unbalanced energy can make it go it a number of places so it does go in all directions all at once because it experiences all of the possibilities at the same time.

Maybe in synthetic benchmarks, but just like with ""regular"" computers today, the software is holding back the hardware.

Lazy programmers use *one* core and then burden the system down with bloated code, have no respect for RAM and ultimately make a brand spanking new computer barely any faster than one from years ago.

Entanglement and Bell's theorem tell us that quantum mechanics is *either* deterministic, but not local (ie, *something* goes faster than the speed of light/instantaneously), or it's local, but not deterministic. So for Einstein, who personally disbelieves all the advances of quantum mechanics being probabilistic in nature, of course the inevitable outcome of entanglement looks like ""spooky action"" and stuff breaking the laws of relativity he (among others) discovered.
The whole ""spooky action"" thing is really just Einstein's own personal views of quantum mechanics.

To use the flatland analogy, if I were to take a three-dimensional U shaped object, and place each leg of the U on flatland, the two dimensional observers would see two independent objects, not being aware of the third dimension.
