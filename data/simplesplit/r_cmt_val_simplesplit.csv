If you entangle two particles (A and B), separate them, and then cause particle B to collapse, Einstein's ""spooky action at a distance"" kicks in and causes particle A to collapse in the opposite spin. The guy holding particle A doesn't know it has collapsed yet and by reading it, he risks collapsing A if it hasn't. This makes any quantum communication useful in terms of tampering (because we will know if it has been intercepted), but doesn't provide you with the ability to communicate instantly across distances, even though the waveform collapse happens instantly. Any communication must be verified with a normal method bound by the speed of light.
If you can read the position without disturbing it, then the tampering prevention feature goes away, but who cares? We'd have interstellar, instantaneous communication and maybe even the ability to communicate across time.
**TL;DR: Be skeptical, but if it's true it might give us instant communication across the universe**
Note: I'll happily take comments on why I'm wrong about this.";0;10yemu;[]

Existing Blockchain technology could face a fatal impact. So, current blockchains will require their own migration. This will likely take the form of a fork or a protocol update, creating a new post-quantum chain or addresses and a limited window of time for users to migrate their data and assets. Even if everyone takes the same protection measures, quantum computers might eventually become so fast that they will undermine the Bitcoin transaction process. In this case, the security of the Bitcoin blockchain will be fundamentally broken. The only solution, in this case, is to transition to a new type of cryptography called post-quantum cryptography.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But it's already proven that they can. At least currently used methods like ecdsa in bitcoin. Shor's algorithm can break ecdsa, but is impossible to perform on normal computers. But it works on quantum computers. Haven't had time but the article probably also states, that other signature algorithms will be needed. But those haven't been tested yet to be capable of handling the security requirements of a trillion dollar cryptocurrency. A while ago I read about a probably quantum-secure digital signature algorithm based on supersingular isogenies, that is thought to be quantum safe. But bringing those algorithms to big cryptocurrencies would be hard. As everyone would need to link his new adress to his old. And then after a while all old adresses would be invalid, if they didn't transfer their assets over to a new quantum-secure adress.";0;pi7q5u;[]

Whether the math proves it to be true is irrelevant, the math itself is indeed imaginary as well. Our entire understanding of the way the universe works are based on observations that we have been entirely contaminating by even observing their existence. Since it's impossible to actually know the exact location and trajectory of a particle until we measure it there is no factual way of determing if that particle simply stopped to be observed or if that was its intended measurements before observation occurs. How can we be sure that we ourselves are not acting as particles to the 4th dimensional observer? These subatomic materials clearly have enough sentience ro be aware of their observation and act according to our presence because there holds a direct correlation between our imaginary numbers and these particles. There's no mistake that these particles are giving us the information and feeding it to us through some unseen link between the immaterial and the material. The very existence of dark matter suggests an invisible force guiding all things through the observable universe. It's my theory that not only does the God particle exist but it is a product of the interaction when dark matter and matter are able to meet at the exact same frequency. Since dark matter is immensely difficult to produce and there is only a finite amount it is near impossible to get accurate findings that can be called conclusive and until we have reached a higher level civilization that progress will only be at a crawl pace. Modern scientists have recently discovered 11 new packets of dimensions that are all geometrically different in their measurements and this was through the observations they've made on dark matter, the quantized world around us, and even space itself. We are moving beyond the world of science fiction and into the field of general accepted theory friends. Our world, our universe grows bigger and bigger each second and with our observations those growths get larger and larger.

Everyone tries to make quantum entanglement sound like something amazing and completely takes it out of context. Instead of dealing with terms like spin and polarization lets just take it at a level everyone can understand. Assume your particles are baseballs, they are thrown exactly the same, they're considered entangled when they will react the same way to the same situation every time. They stop being entangled when something interferes with them, one of them has a wall placed 5 feet in front of it, when it hits the wall, it's not entangled anymore.
People seem to think entangled means that, if 2 baseballs are entangled on the ground and I pick one up the other magically floats upward to match which is just ridiculous. The point being, you cannot physically change one and instantly have the other change. The only entanglement is if NOTHING interferes with them in which case if nothing interferes with them they can be as far apart as they want and the way one acts is the same way the other acts because nothings messing up their entanglement.
In actuality this is VERY VERY useless. Science takes a lot of things how they weren't meant to be interpreted, like superposition for instance, lets say something only has 2 states, science says until you look at it and figure out which state it's in it's in both of the states at once. The idea behind this was to tell scientists not to make assumptions until they know, they took it literally though and turned it into a scientific principal.
How about another, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, you can't know where something is and where it's going at the same time, the fact that we can measure trajectories of objects disproves that. Yet another fail for science.
How about hawking radiation, NOTHING can escape a black hole, then hawking decides that something CAN escape which should be obviously false by the lack of matter in the universe.
How about the speed of light, can't escape a black hole which should only effect something with a mass and yet people think a photon has no mass. Not to mention people think it's the absolute maximum speed possible based SOLELY on no one observing anything faster. Everyone always tries to say it's not, but can never link an actual article showing otherwise.
We know that the light from distant stars takes a long time to reach us and what we are seeing when we look at it is what it looked like when it was sent towards us and not what it is now, meaning those stars you look at in the sky might not even be there anymore, especially when scientists use massive telescopes and use galaxies for their lensing effects. Yet somehow people believe that traveling faster than the speed of light actually takes you back in time and screws with causality when it's clear that all light does is transmit an image. and that if you could travel faster than light you couldn't effect time but you could see what happened back in time because you're viewing the image further back so long as the light isn't obstructed of course.
Pretty much the only phenomenon that's really amazing that science got right is time dilation.

Their states are sort of cloned and thus will forever behave in the same exact way until interrupted. They aren't communicating, they just behave the same way so you can tell how the other behaved by looking at the first one, and this is true no matter how far they are from each other as long as their journey didn't impact them in any way. There is no communication or classical ""teleportation"" there either lol.
It's like spinning two coins in the same direction using the exact same power, running off to the other room with one where it landed on heads and knowing the other coin in the other room also landed on heads. The difference is that the particles can technically cointinue spinning in the exact same way until you stop one of them. So you can read its position at any given time and know that's also where the other one is, except that it's hard to read their state without interrupting them. Sort of like it being hard to measure something's temperature using a cold thermometer without first touching it with it and making it a bit colder in the process, no longer getting an accurate reading.
Now what the article is explaining is that they managed to safely send those particles (spinning coins) away from each other using a fibre network cable without interrupting their spins. That's all they meant by ""quantum teleportation"", and definitely sounds way less exciting than the term used.";0;kgubyc;[]

That is, time is an epiphenomenon, and artefact, of decoherence. A lump of matter is entirely decoherent simply because its vast numbers of constituents in effect 'vote' on a single reality. This occurs in a utterly tiny amount of time, and is then held steady by majoritarian interactions. Entangled, timeless excitations which interact with it become themselves decoherent, thus forcing a 'before' and an 'after'. Thus, an arrow of time. ;0;8mkhpv;[]
