I don't know the science at all, but from what I understand it's essentially two particles are somehow locked on to each other and match each other's states, so when one particle's state is altered, the other shifts to match that state. It can be as far away or have as much signal blocking as you want between them and their states will still match.
I first learned about it from Mass Effect and decided to look it up one day, and to my pleasant surprise, it was an actual thing... in theory. I'm hopeful we get to see something tangible come out of that theory in the future, but I may not be alive for it. Ah well.";0;vumwlv;[]

When you perform quantum entanglement, both objects are connected through entanglement, making them essentially one object. So there isn't two locations, it's just one really big location (for that entity) that so far scientists have been able to stretch for miles. So no information traveled, since there was no where for it to go, it just expresses itself across the entire domain of the entity.

Submission statement:
Quantum computing (QC) is one of the biggest topics regarding the future of tech, much like machine learning/ai, there is a lot of potential but the current state of progress is often exaggerated to the highest degree. In many ways this runs parallel to the state of self driving technology. It's always a few months around the corner yet that has been said for years at this point. I have no doubt it will get there eventually but the exaggerations are ~~exhausting~~ misleading.";0;x5d6j2;[]

While i do agree that they should be focusing on developing it more than just selling a promise the companies developing it have to generate revenue from somewhere. Like anything in its infancy of course it needs more research to become viable, it's obviously not fully developed. It has a solid enough background to warrant further development so stopping it before it's actually able to produce results because it doesn't produce results now is an impatient mindset. We don't know how things like data measurement will progress and like many other research projects, there will probably be better data collection methods developed just for quantum computing.;0;x5d6j2;[]

This is quantum encryption. Not true ""quantum communication"" like something via quantum entanglement. Best case scenario is more security but the same speed as before. Worst case is slower speeds due to some extra computational overhead. For those more interested this seems pretty mixed for covering the three goals of data security. It should provide very good confidentiality for the time being (a way to break the encryption will be discovered, mark my words). Integrity is a mixed bag since there is always the issue with quantum wave forms collapsing where you MAY not get what was intended (how ever small a chance it may be). Then we have availability. It provides VERY poor availability. Instead of a threat actor needing to establish a large network of bots to initiate a ddos or similar attack, one must simply try to read the communication to end it. A simple slave dish directed at the satellites could end all outbound quantum communication by simply observing the packets. That's bad (unless another mechanism I'm not aware of is in place to prevent this scenario).
Then we have one other issue.... That's the personal. Any one working in security fields knows that users screwing up (intentionally or not) is probably our biggest risk right next to improper implementation and configuration (think equifax or the iCloud hacks from a while back). One time quantum pads will help, but only so much. We'll see. And now I wait to be told why I'm wrong :) ";0;a963g1;[]

A discovery of a galaxy that has no ""dark matter"" and that spins much in accordance with standard gravity but otherwise has the same characteristics as galaxies that spin faster than predicted by standard gravity.
""Dark matter"" supporters can say that this galaxy seems to have significant clump of dark matter and this other galaxy does not, similar to how some solar systems have planets and others don't.
Verlinde and MOND cranks have no such luxury: Gravity can't behave one way for one galaxy and then a totally different way for a another similar galaxy. They've painted themselves into a corner.
Also Verlinde theory is a lot of taking existing math and re-writing it to show linkage between two different entities.

How many actual quantum computers would you say exist in the world today? I know that is a difficult question because their are almost certainly some unknown ones (NSA, Military, Foreign Government, etc...), but if you had to make an educated guess what would you say?
Ive seen the photos of IBMs quantum computer, and it looks extremely complex/expensive. At the rate that we are currently developing quantum computers, how long would you guess it would be before the first commercially produced ones will be purchasable for the general public (if ever).
I remember reading a theory about quantum computers (that arent programmed with advanced AI) actually being so capable that they could eventually create a sentient AI (singularity) without humans creating said AI. Is that actually a possibility?
Last one. So cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are mined by powerful processors that have to solve complex problems in order to be rewarded with the currency. The more powerful/capable your mining hardware is, the more you can earn. Could one of these advanced quantum computers pretty much takeover a crypto mining sector by outperforming standard computer hardware? Couldnt they be used to brute force basically any passwords and/or security networks with the ridiculous amount of processes that they can run in a few seconds? Thanks.";0;i9k0nh;[]

Hey though good for them... they are getting funding for some reason, and they wont even be able to develop languages till they can hold states in a human time frame. Fun idea but moron science, mostly, because of the extreme temps required. That being said the science is paramount. I'll lay it down real fast, simply put original computers used switches to hold 1's and 0's (tubes on/off) and that's the same pretence we use today. They are using ""quantum states"" (not even sure quantum physics is an actual science) instead of on/off. The simplification (like the switches being a simplification of a transistor) would be somthing like spheres filled with fluid. Many more positions increases computing power (but you need machine level languages, current ones were developed in the 50's/60's).
Thats the idea... couple decades ago they were gonna use extreme temps to make fusion... needless to say the simularities extend beyond temperature. Intel, as im sure you havnt heard, has a black box project using 3D transistors that have 4 positions, and is being azured by google for fast paced language development.

Quantum computers, which harness the superposition and entangle-
ment of physical states, could outperform their classical counter-
parts in solving problems with technological impactsuch as
factoring large numbers and searching databases1,2. A quantum pro-
cessor executes algorithms by applying a programmable sequence of
gates to an initialized register of qubits, which coherently evolves
into a final state containing the result of the computation. Building a
quantum processor is challenging because of the need to meet simul-
taneously requirements that are in conflict: state preparation, long
coherence times, universal gate operations and qubit readout.
Processors based on a few qubits have been demonstrated using
nuclear magnetic resonance35, cold ion trap6,7 and optical8 systems,
but a solid-state realization has remained an outstanding challenge.
Here we demonstrate a two-qubit superconducting processor and
the implementation of the Grover search and DeutschJozsa
quantum algorithms1,2. We use a two-qubit interaction, tunable in
strength by two orders of magnitude on nanosecond timescales,
which is mediated by a cavity bus in a circuit quantum electrody-
namics architecture9,10. This interaction allows the generation of
highly entangled states with concurrence up to 94 per cent.
Although this processor constitutes an important step in quantum
computing with integrated circuits, continuing efforts to increase
qubit coherence times, gate performance and register size will be
required to fulfil the promise of a scalable technology.

The article talks about laser cooling, quantum networks, and other ""cool-sounding"" things, but I don't think it describes what he actually did really well. For anyone who's interested, here's a classical (non-quantum) explanation of what happens:
Okay, you may have heard of ""total internal reflection"" Basically, it means that, when hitting the boundary with two substances of differing electric/magnetic susceptibilities, all of the energy of a light wave is reflected internally and no energy is transmitted across the boundary. However, even if no energy is transmitted across the boundary, there is still an evanescent wave, which decreases in amplitude very quickly in space, that is transmitted across.
Basically, they cooled down an atom and used trapping to situate the atom right next to where this reflection would occur. The atom can then interact very strongly with these evanescent waves and block the photon (so that the atom acts as a closed gate). However, by absorbing a single photon, the energy level of the atom changes, so that it is no longer coupled to these evanescent waves. So now the atom acts like an open gate. Basically, you can use a single photon to switch the gate open/closed, like the article says.";0;24rsp4;[]

Second case use is rendering extremely complex models that are a perfect copy of their real world counterparts. Rendering a hydrogen atom is easy. Your school issued chromebook could render each possible state of it and its single proton and electron. Rendering each possible state of an atom like thulium, which has 69 entangled electrons, would take around 20 trillion years for a classical computer.
[Destroying the economy and cybersecurity as a whole](
Third case use is pretty terrifying. Because quantum computers are amazing at breaking down massive data sets, they can be pointed at things like cryptography. For the most part, modern cryptography has been relatively successful at preventing massive attacks and data breaches. However all those attacks were all made by classical computers with nowhere near as much power.
A good majority of modern encryptions simply dont have the ability to withstand a quantum attack. And thats not a fault of the encryption, quantum computers are just that good at going through massive data sets. Encryptions that would be completely impervious to traditional methods get bulldozed by this new technology.

The difference is that the segmentation comes down to physically separated blobs of matter. The Copenhagen notion of ""observation"" has generated any amount of nonsense. What we know is that a milligram of matter comes ot an equilibrium with itself - a sort of majority vote - in 10^-27 seconds of so. That is what makes it classical. However, the way that it ""voted"" does not effect other similar chunks unless they are entangled with it, which they can be only after it ""votes"", becomes semi-determined. There is a strong argument that such local fixity and entanglement with other lumps of matter constitute the grounds for spacetime. Bacteria are a decided voting quorum, having around 10^11 component atoms, each of which has its constituent particles. They can be expected to exist in a strongly determined state, with very brief periods when the ensemble has to ""vote"" due to an external influence. However, if you go out of your way to isolate one of these, and then act on the photosynthetic centres alone, you can expect it to acquire less determined properties. However, that's not down to 'life' or anything but isolation. Photons are innately quantum entities, and if they interact with absorbent molecules held in isolation, you can expect to see quantum-like phenomena. As you might from a totally inorganic entity - say, a nitrogen atom in a diamond. ";0;9y53lo;[]

Quantum computing is based on the idea that a quantum bit isn't just a 1 or 0, like a normal bit. It is a difficult-to-measure probability that the bit is either zero or one. It takes 8 traditional bits of information to represent a single letter of the alphabet, like 10011011. A single quantum bit could have a small chance of being a zero or a small chance of being a one or be closer to 50/50 and everything in between. The more accurately you can measure that probability, the more information you can squeeze into a single bit. And getting more information in less space means that a small computer chip can do a lot more processing than is possible today. The problem with using the probability that something is a 1 or a 0 is that it's difficult to measure. It's tempting to just peek, but as soon as you look, it's either a one or a zero. There's no 50/50 chance anymore. It's just a regular old bit. Booooring. One thing that they can do is peek, but just a little bit. They might flash a light on it for an absurdly short time and say did you see it? I think so but I'm not sure. Aha! That's like a 75% chance! But the longer you peek, the more certain you become. So then they thought, what if we keep flashing a light at it, on off on off. And that works for a little while, because they're not just looking at a stationary target, it's a moving target. And that works for a little while, but eventually you get too much information to pretend you don't know. Imagine watching an invisible person dribble a flourescent basketball in an invisible auditorium with a strobe light. At first you'd see the ball going down. Then hit some kind of bottom. Then it goes up. Then a hand touches it around waist height. Then it goes back down. Oh OK I get it now. At any given point during that dribble you weren't sure if it was going to keep going down or start going back up or what would happen. You could make an educated guess or probability, but until it bounced you wouldn't know where the floor was. But it wouldn't take long to figure out the pattern. And knowing where the ball is isn't very exciting. Remember, the part that makes quantum computers work is knowing the probability, not the actual value So these guys are constantly trying to find ways to trick themselves into not knowing for sure, but knowing enough to get a really good probability. That sounds weird but it's the key to what they're doing. So they said what if I watched that basketball, but instead of using a normal strobe light, I had it pulse randomly. Sometimes the ball is going up, sometimes down, and because it's random, I genuinely don't know where the ball will be next time the light flashes. But if it's too random, then that isn't very useful. I'll get great random predictions but it will take me too much time to unwind the randomness that it will slow down my computing. They need it to be a little random, but also a little predictable. Something that makes it difficult to know where the basketball is with certainty, but also something that computers are good at. For people who don't remember the Fibonacci sequence it is made but continuing to sum the last two numbers. So it starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 because 0 plus 1 is 1, 1 plus 1 is 2, 1 plus 2 is 3, 2 plus 3 is 5, etc. Computers are really good with stuff like that. Simple, repeatable calculations, especially simple addition. So they had the strobe light flash at a weird interval based on the fibonacci sequence and played guesswhere the basketball will be. And what they found was that they could trick themselves a lot longer into not knowing where the basketball would be - a second and a half, which is a really long time in computer terms. They used a really weird basketball (ten atoms of an element you've probably never heard of) and a really weird strobe light, but that's not really important. They took an interesting step in getting better at this. The interesting part is what's next. Is the fibonacci sequence the best choice? It's pretty good at tricking us and quick for computers to figure out. Maybe there's something better. Maybe a different element or different test would help. This was a good step but not the last one.";0;yavq6p;[]

It seems like he as an issue with people in the field not making guesses that *he* thinks should have been better. His objection seem to be more along of the lines of ""this connection seems so obvious to *me*, so why did everyone else spend so much time on other paths"", and yet he frames it as some deep issue of philosophy involving not taking ""qualitative"" aspects of previous ideas into account(whatever that's supposed to mean). Moreover, his objection in this regard smacks of an anti-scientific concept: knowing what makes sense before thorough testing.
Scientists were lost for decades at a time back in the 19th century when it comes to figuring out the true nature of electromagnetism, while positing all sorts of completely wrong guesses to test. We'd been riding a pretty strong wave of consistent results from their eventual discoveries since, while simultaneously running up against another wall ourselves with respect to integrating quantum theory and relativity. We just happen to be at a new edge which is incredibly difficult to deal with for some fundamental physical reasons that make obvious testing difficult (we're hitting up against the boundaries of what's possible to measure with our current technology).
When people at the edge of human conception about the physical nature of the universe fail to make connections or find better structures within their theories and personal thought experiments, it's not the result of some deep philosophical deficit within the field, it's par for the course because it's unfathomably difficult work.";0;2e9qe8;[]

> &quot;We are really proud of this; it&#039;s a big frickin&#039; deal,&quot; Dario Gil, who directs AI and quantum computing at IBM, told MIT Technology Review.
> Its researchers have made significant progress with superconducting systems in particular, heightening competition with IBM. Earlier this year, researchers at Google suggested that a quantum computer capable of using 50 qubits would surpass the capabilities of a conventional supercomputer-a landmark dubbed &quot;Quantum supremacy&quot;.

Link: Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is a promising technique for the direct conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels. Colloidal quantum dots with tunable band gap and versatile surface properties remain among the most prominent targets in photocatalysis despite their frequent toxicity, which is detrimental for environmentally friendly technological implementations. In the present work, all-inorganic sulfide-capped InP and InP/ZnS quantum dots are introduced as competitive and far less toxic alternatives for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in aqueous solution, reaching turnover numbers up to 128,000 based on quantum dots with a maximum internal quantum yield of 31%. In addition to the favorable band gap of InP quantum dots, in-depth studies show that the high efficiency also arises from successful ligand engineering with sulfide ions. Due to their small size and outstanding hole capture properties, sulfide ions effectively extract holes from quantum dots for exciton separation and decrease the physical and electrical barriers for charge transfer.";0;9kq3l4;[]

Which isn't surprising, since D-Wave have been so rubbish at communicating in anything but hyperbole...shooting themselves in the foot even though they seem to have actually achieved something impressive!
D-Wave have been going on about this sort of thing for quite a while, but there was heavy scepticism because they basically seemed to be claiming to have solved all (massive) outstanding problems in quantum computing, but wouldn't really tell anyone how or do proper demonstrations.
It now seems to be emerging that *can* make machines that *probably* do use quantum effects to solve a *particular class* of problems. That's great, and the class of problems includes many useful real life ones. But it probably *isn't* a quantum computer in the sense that everyone else in the field ever uses the term - that is, it's not a general calculation device using qubits. That isn't necessarily a problem, it may be able to solve problems in its class faster than a classical computer and even algorithmically faster than is classically possible. But it doesn't mean it's a general purpose machine that could possibly replace (say) your CPU right now. They and many others are probably working towards the more general case, and they've probably made important breakthroughs on the way, but it doesn't sound like they're actually there yet.
Since they really do seem to be producing useful machines and have recently produced some more convincing evidence of quantum effects, it will be very interesting to see where this leads, but be very wary of taking these kinds of articles at face value.

> Its a big win for D-Wave, said Rose, who has battled skeptics who questioned the legitimacy of his quantum technology a technology he noted no other company is working on today.
This kind of thing is vaguely annoying - the initial scepticism was heavily justified, and shouldn't be whitewashed away by them eventually properly proving a level of success. Also, I'd be willing to bet that *many* companies (and governments...) are working on this kind of technology, though the field focuses on the more general quantum computer concept. Perhaps nobody is publicly working on exactly the same sort of machine...

Octonions are not as well known as the quaternions and complex numbers, which are much more widely studied and used.

The basics that I got from it is right now, computers try every combination of possibilities one by one when they are calculating something, whereas quantum computers can try exponentially more outcomes at once, and do it simultaneously. So, if I have this right, a logic gate is asked ""what is 4+4""? A computer tries 0, then 1, then 2, etc all the way to 8, getting the answer ""no"" until it gets to 8. With a quantum computer, it tests every possibility from 1 to 2^^^y simultaneously, where y is the number of qubits you have, i.e. 3 qubits allows you to test 1 through 8 all at once.

Beware, highly technical. He starts with the Hamiltonian of a classical system with broken time symmetry. This is shown to have internal mathematical problems. He asserts: *The connection between breakdown of the equation of motion and breaking of time translation symmetry (i.e., motion in the ground state) is general:*. In essence, the minimum energy state of the system has non-zero motion. He shows that there are two ways out of this.
The next step is to look at a quantised system, noting that - given the above - a *system with spontaneous time translation-symmetry breaking appears perilously close to being a perpetual motion machine.* However, *We can capture an important part of the essence of the matter by considering a very simple quantum mechanical model, to wit a charged particle on a ring threaded by magnetic flux.* Mathematics shows that the ground state (minimum energy) of this particle has it circling the ring, because its minimum energy state implies motion. The system must have infinite degrees of freedom, as finite systems cannot show symmetry breaking. So:
*We take an infinite number of copies of our ring-particles, with an identical attractive interaction between each pair. The particles will want to be in the same place* (because they are mutually attractive), and for reasons given above re minimum energy state, they will want to move. *So we can expect to get a moving lump. Such a dynamical configuration will violate time translation symmetry, giving us a time crystal.* Dah daa, followed by a lot of algebra to establish the regularity - repetition - of this within a quantum system.

Another tidbit about entanglement that is tricky comes up when thinking about what happens when observing one particle that is entangled with another. Measuring one particular doesn't actively change the state of the second, it is simply a probe to get information about the state of the second particle. My understanding is that entanglement is just a special case of strong correlations between two systems.

Here is a cool paper that just got put up on arxiv about classical entanglement: []( &#x200B;
They argue that entanglement is not an inherently quantum process. Entanglement is observed in quantum systems, but it is actually a consequence of randomness and statistical correlations. Both of those properties are present in quantum systems, but can also be present in classical systems.

1) How, precisely, is such a state change detected? 2) Wouldn't such a state-change measurement collapse the wave function of photon B? If so, how could such a timing measurement be made, since multiple state change measurements have to be made to determine the timing?
3) If you really could detect when photon B transitioned from ""no definite state"" to ""definite state"" due to the collapse of photon A's wavefunction, you'd have a way to transmit information faster than the speed of light: using a lineup of photons A1, A2, A3, ... entangled with B1, B2, B3, ..., you could vary the time between collapses of A series photons to transmit binary information, and detect those variances by detecting those state changes using the B series photons.";0;1bavah;[]

Let's assume that your are living on the East Coast and that you have friend on the West Coast. Let's furthermore assume, that you have a common friend living somewhere in Iowa.
Your friend in Iowa has two bottles with marbles: One bottle with red marbles, another bottle with blue marbles. Your friend picks two marbles from one bottle. Therefore both marbles have the same color (which you don't know yet) and represent entangled photons for our thought experiment.
Now your friend in Iowa sends each of you a package with one of the two ""entangled"" marbles, that both have the same color. The package arrives and you know, that there's a marble in the package. You don't know the color of the marble. For you the color of the marble could be anything. You only know that the marbles you and your friend have received have the same color.
You open the package and find a blue marble and you know immediately, that your friend has received a blue marble as well. That's, um, obvious and on a basic level everything that happens with quantum entanglement. But how can you use that phenomenon to tell your friend, that you will visit him in two weeks?
The answer is: You can't! The marble of your friend won't immediately change from blue to red, when you paint your marble red, but that would be necessary to establish a communication through quantum entanglement. You can only tell your friend to paint his marble red too, but that has to happen with a conventional communication device, that cannot exceed the speed of light. --- ---
In quantum mechanics things are bit different and more complicated of course. In quantum mechanics the package can contain more than just one marble, and the marbles can have different shapes and colors. And you don't need a friend in Iowa to make sure, that you don't know the content of the package until you open the package. Quantum mechanics do that for you. When you open the package, you receive a random result. And once you have opened the package, you can change the content as much as you want, it won't affect the content of the other package. That's not how quantum entanglement work.
But it's even worse in quantum physics: The content of the package is also determined by how you open the package. Open the package at midnight and you receive a marble. Open the package in the morning and you may find a dice. The troublesome but also interesting thing (for cryptography and quantum computers) is, that the content of the package can be BOTH even after you and your friend have opened the packages (in quantum mechanics ""opening the package"" means measuring the state of the particles in a specific way). Let's assume that you open the package at midnight and find a marble. The package of your friend and the West Coast contains a marble as well? Yes, but only of our friend opens his package at midnight as well. But if he opens his package in the morning, he will find a dice. To make sure that you both find a marble, you'd have to tell your friend, that he has to open his package at midnight, and that can - you guessed it already - only happen through conventional communication devices.
Superluminal communication via quantum entanglement is impossible because you always need an additional communication channel, that cannot exceed the speed of light. And teleportation is impossible as well since you can't modify the photon and it's entangled twin. Quantum entanglement simply doesn't work that way (and it will never; that's not just a technological barrier).

Using weak measurements, however, it is possible to operationally define a set of trajectories for an ensemble of quantum particles. >We sent single photons emitted by a quantum dot through a double-slit interferometer and reconstructed these trajectories by performing a weak measurement of the photon momentum, post-selected according to the result of a strong measurement of photon position in a series of planes. The results provide an observationally grounded description of the propagation of sub-ensembles of quantum particles in a two-slit interferometer.
The most remarkable diagram is shown [here]( These contours reconstruct the average trajectories of single photons as they move from one slit (not both) to their strike on the detector. The conceptual implications of this are considerable, but I won't explore them here. The point of this post is that measurements of this sort yield useful information, if not information about the uncollapsed wave state. Indeed, what coudl information about an indeterminate state look like, except.. indeterminate? ";0;16jpg5;[]

This is something nobody does because CCSD is one of the most accurate and expensive methods in quantum chemistry and using a minimal basis guarantees that the result isn't going to be useful. If you look at figure 3b their error reaches 0.02 Hartree, which is very far from what we call [chemical accuracy]( - about 0.0016 Hartree. Actually, more accurate calculations were done in the [1960s]( an back then Koos and Wolniewicz didn't even use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The authors of this article did some ground-breaking work inventing algorithms to employ quantum annealing for electronic structure calculations, which is awesome, but they purposefully chose a simple problem (using a minimal basis they have just one parameter to optimize) to find out which one of their two alternative approaches works better.

Most of the cosmos in space and in time is too hot or too cold or too dense or too sparse or too chaotic or too stagnant for life. Even in this precious moment and special place we call Earth there have already been 5 major extinctions. The last one was 65million years ago and wiped out the colossal dinosaurs. 99% of species have been previously wiped out. Just a few years ago a tsunami wiped out 200,000 of us in a single day. That's .03% of our population because of a splash of water. While we are the most knowledgeable beings ever to have lived on Earth and can possibly detect meteors and comets on a collision course and change their trajectories and to some extent foresee conditions build up for likely tornadoes, hurricane paths, earthquakes, tsunamis we are also smart enough to build nuclear weapons and disrupt the climate and poison our own water supply. Even if we can survive these natural and man made hazards the sun will one day engold our planet and the Milky Way will collide with andromeda and the universe will expand to near absolute zero temperatures. The feelings of altruism, love, sympathy are all programmed into our DNA to help those close to us, most especially our children, as they carry our genes. An AI has no genes. It knows not love for a child. It has no feelings. It has no fear. It understands not pain. Those are things that eventually could be programmed into it but it's a tricky endeavor that can backfire on us. Eventually it will have no need for us. In fact, it may find that we may be consuming some of the same resources it will need. It may see us as we see bacteria or viruses. A virus is arguably not even a living thing. A super general purpose AI would consider us barely conscious. We can only see what's directly in front of us. We barely remember the things we've learned in college. We can only read one item at a time. Our communication is slow and limited. A higher being could kill us with no remorse. We are by comparison, nothing special. So I am not sure that they would have our best interest in mind in the long run. Some of the best minds have been tackling this AI issue and feel that one way or another it eventually does not end well for us. But if we can create this super being that can thrive and go on in space and time far beyond what we could have ever dreamed of with our limited minds and bodies then maybe it's time we pass on the baton and let the universe know itself better than we could have ever begun to imagine. ;0;4uhlc3;[]

Currently, the fastest quantum computer (that isn't even market available yet) can do 2^(53) possible combinations of bits in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. It would take 2^(203) cycles to be able to break Bitcoin private and public addresses and render them useless. That would be the equivalent to roughly 8.15 10^(15) years to perform such an operation . In that time, Bitcoin could easily just add more possible addresses through another hardfork which changes the address format. Using Moore's Law, we can expect the rate of improvement of quantum computers to double every two years. Even if that happens, it will take 406 years to be able to completely break Bitcoin.

But then the QC hacker needs to spend your funds faster than you. So if you don't reuse addresses that's of little concern because of the block time being too short (probably).
Now for a QC to guess your pvt key from your pub key alone, that's basically guess work. With roughly 2^128 possibilities (roughly 10^38 and no, it is not the whole 256 bits), the QC would need to find it in a reasonable time (before, say, the owner moves it to another cold storage).
Let's say a reasonable time is 1 year (actually it would weeks or less), that gives 10^38 addresses to be tested within the ""reasonable time"" of 1 year.
Let's dumbly map that to hash per second. Currently the mining power is at 150 EH/s. that's about 1.5 * 10^19. Now we are close to the square root of the amount, so that means you would need all the mining power currently available squared, which means the QC would need to do the job of 1 trillion copies of current all mining farms, 10 million times faster. (or vice-versa, or other combination).
We could go on and calculate how many superposed states the machine would need to achieve all of this. The bottom line is that you would probably lack materials or energy, or would hit another constraint because of the sheer size.
ps: it is just a dumb back of the envelope estimate, there are many considerations such as how much power does it drain, maybe there is not even enough available power in the energetic matrix, because a QC is not an standalone machine and uses classical computers around it to churn numbers classically which are generated by the QC superposition states.
ps:2: when that becomes a concern, we can always increase the size of the keys, say, to 1024 bits. But that's also not that easy because any new curve needs some proofs (and proofs are always tentative based on many assumptions that can be incomplete or not very good).";0;ipn127;[]

Light based communication via fiber optic cable is easily intercepted. Using qubits and quantum entanglement for data transfer would be much harder to intercept, mostly because the average person knows nothing about quantum engineering or how it works. But also because with quantum entanglement, there can't really be a middleman.
I don't even really know how it works, but here's one from the University of Innsbruck: [](
&#x200B;
>The quantum internet promises absolutely tap-proof communication and powerful distributed sensor networks for new science and technology. However, because quantum information cannot be copied, it is not possible to send this information over a classical network. Quantum information must be transmitted by quantum particles, and special interfaces are required for this. The Innsbruck-based experimental physicist Ben Lanyon, who was awarded the Austrian START Prize in 2015 for his research, is researching these important intersections of a future quantum Internet. Now his team at the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck and at the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information of the Austrian Academy of Sciences has achieved a record for the transfer of quantum entanglement between matter and light. For the first time, a distance of 50 kilometers was covered using fiber optic cables. ""This is two orders of magnitude further than was previously possible and is a practical distance to start building inter-city quantum networks,"" says Ben Lanyon.";0;ny3g3u;[]

>In a new study due this week in the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Rice University theoretical physicist Qimiao Si and colleagues at the Rice Center for Quantum Materials in Houston and the Vienna University of Technology in Austria make predictions that could help experimental physicists create what the authors have coined a Weyl-Kondo semimetal, a quantum material with an assorted collection of properties seen in disparate materials like topological insulators, heavy fermion metals and high-temperature superconductors. >All these materials fall under the heading of quantum materials, ceramics, layered composites and other materials whose electromagnetic behavior cannot be explained by classical physics. In the words of noted science writer Philip Ball, quantum materials are those in which the quantum aspects assert themselves tenaciously, and the only way to fully understand how the material behaves is to keep the quantum in view. >These quirky behaviors arise only at very cold temperatures, where they cannot be masked by the overwhelming forces of thermal energy. The most celebrated quantum materials are the high-temperature superconductors discovered in the 1980s, so named for their ability to conduct electrical current without resistance at temperatures well above those of traditional superconductors.

[](
As a High Performance Computing research scientist, Ill say that while the article linked in the OP is very surface level and clickbaity, the findings of this study are legitimately of significant value. Yes the quantum computer was working on a problem that QCs may be particularly good at but that doesnt mean that the findings or the 9000 years stat is worthless. The supercomputer they were comparing to, Fugaku, is an incredibly powerful system (one of the best in the world).
Supercomputers also are really only good at certain types of problems - those that can be distributed and parallelized. Most processors in a supercomputer are clocked slower than those in a desktop gaming computer. The main difference is that in a supercomputer, there are hundreds to thousands of processors. But that fact doesnt make supercomputing research worthless. Quantum computers are similar and are really good at certain types of problems - while that may make it seem less flashy to a general audience, the demonstration of its capabilities in those types of problems is still incredibly relevant and advances the state of the art.";0;vrn1gt;[]

This means that the wave function (the object that contains all of the information about a particle) extends not just in all spatial directions, but also in the ""direction"" of time. This is not to say that time is directional, but rather that it is one of the four perpendicular axes defining a four-space in which particles live. In fact, I don't think reverse causality is a particularly new idea. As soon as relativists realized what world lines were, there were questions about causality traveling at the speed of light both forward and backward in time since all of time was supposed to exist at once, and we just lacked the proper vehicle for traveling orthogonal to space. These measurements are the new part, though.";0;1dzxfi;[]

They are performing 2 or 3 measurements in a row. If a result of second is bigger than expected, then it's the 3rd measurement interfering backwards in time with 2nd. Okay. What were the results of 2nd measurement when they *didn't* perform the third one? Thanks for asking, the results were *also bigger than expected*. The only difference was this: if they did perform 3rd, the results of 2nd are bigger because 3rd caused them to; if they didn't the results are bigger because of experimental error in apparatus or whatever.

1) I thought that the collapse of the wavefunction had to do with the discrete nature of energy. I mean: imagine that we set up the double slit experiment again. We send a one quantum energy wave against the slits. The wave goes through the slits and the interferences appear beyond the slits. Once the interfering 1 quantum wave hits the back detecting screen, it happens the following: since 1 quantum can't be subdivided into smaller quantities of energy, then that single quantum can't be subdivided so it affects several separated points of the detecting screen, so a smooth gradual spread pattern of diffraction can't appear, but the 1 quantum wave will only affect one random spot on the detecting screen. Wasn't this how the wave function ""collapse"" worked?
2) However the wave function manages to collapse, if it really collapses, then we get this other fact in our double slit experiment: once the wave collapses at a single spot of the measuring screen and so this spot enters the ""hit state"", then all the other points *logically* enter a ""not hit state"" in an instantaneous way. So doesn't it make it the functioning of the entanglement between the different points of the measuring screen a simple matter of ""logic"", which is why entanglement can work in an ""instantaneous"" way?

could that somehow be related to the quantum entanglement stuff? like maybe that particle way over there eventually becomes a particle that's a part of me in the future, which is why noting my particles causes that one to instantly change. because it's eventually a part of me, or according to (my version of) the 4th dimension, it already is a part of me.

Preliminary definition: An exciton is a type of ""particle"" that can form on a crystal with certain properties. It's basically an electron and an electron hole (i.e. a place an electron should be but isn't, usually because it gained energy somehow and moved out of the valence band) that are attracted to one another, since they have opposite charge. This allows a material to transport energy in the form of the motion of the exciton, without transporting any charge, since the electron is negatively charged and the electron hole is positively charged, so they're electric dipoles that are overall neutral much like a hydrogen atom.
The experiment used a cavity resonator, which is basically a specially shaped container that bounces photons back and forth in it. It has what's called a resonant frequency, which means that only photons of particular frequencies are able to bounce back and forth inside it. They did this to make sure they're only using photons of a particular wavelength.
The crystal (the one imported from Namibia) they used has a particularly high Rydberg constant, which is a rare property in most materials. Because it has such a high Rydberg constant, it admits excitons of correspondingly high energies with reasonably high lifetimes (around 300 ps). Higher-energy excitons react more strongly to photons (i.e. they're strongly coupled). The final state that they were trying to produce were Rydberg exciton-polaritons, which are just excitons that are strongly coupled to photons.
So they put the crystal into their resonator and tuned their light to create excitons in the crystal. The excitons were able to couple strongly to the photons, and they were able to produce Rydberg polaritons of larger sizes and higher energies than previously seen.";0;u6w5xr;[]

What you're doing is then 100-33 = 67, which is the integer you are looking for. This is how the state of the second atom is inferred, there's no connection or information flow between those atoms.

There seems to be quite the discussion developing on the ""double slit"" experiment and other stuff about ""observers"" and ""consciousness"". There is no mystery or deep philosophical problem here. First lets straighten out the ""entanglement"" misconceptions. Entanglement is a bad word to describe what is happening here. Entanglement refers to the correlations between particles that cannot be described using classical probability. For instance if you decided to use classical probability to work out the odds of two particles being polarised in the same way upon detection then you would use the permutation formula in probability. Doing this you can calculate probabilities for all possible permuations for both particles to be polarised relative to a specific angle. And suppose for the sake of argument that the maximum value for the probability you can get in the set of all permuations is 2/3. Now if you use quantum mechanics to work out the probabilities and suppose again for the sake of argument the maximum value possible for the probability of 2 particles to be correlated relative to a specific polarisation angle is 3/4. So by using quantum mechanics you get probabilities for correlations between particles that cannot be accounted for using classical probability. It is these extra correlations that have come to be known as entanglement. But wait! One way of calculating the probabilities must be wrong? Which is it? Classical or Quantum? It's quantum as it has been experimentally verified several times now using the Bell test. And the simple truth is it does not matter whether it is spatial or temporal. They're just a probability for the particles to be correlated in some way.
&#x200B;
Now the double slit experiment. I actually posted this before on the eli5 for the double split experiment but it was largely ignored so I'll post it again here in the hopes that it will clear up all the misconceptions about ""observers\* and ""the act of observation"" and all that vague stuff that really can't be defined properly and to be honest has no place in a rigorous scientific setting. So with the double slit experiment whats actually happening is a consequence of not being able to measure precisely where the particle is. This comes from there being an uncertainty in the position of predicting where the particle will land. Also the interference pattern does not appear immediately. It builds up over time. To see this you slow down the light so it arrives at the screen 1 photon at a time. After the first few photons are detected it looks like a random pattern. But then as time evolves and more and more photons are detected it looks like they are making up a banding-like pattern on the screen. In some bands there are hardly any marks. In other bands there are loads of marks. And the number of marks in each band seems symmetrical around a centerline. Physicists (and mathematicans) have a word for this. Its called a probability distribution. Whenever you have a bunch of stuff in a space you can order them according to some property of the stuff. The most familiar one is the normal distribution. Thats that bell shaped curve thing. Say you're marking an exam out of 100 and you want to make a plot where the x axis is 1,2,3,.,98,99,100 and the y axis is the number of students. You start to plot. 2 students get 3 marks, 5 students get 10 marks, 15 students get 40 marks, 40 students get 50 marks ,60 students get 65 marks, 20 students get 80 marks, 4 sutdents get 90 marks, 1 student got 100 marks. Then youll find that the Bell shaped curve starts to emerge. And curves are funny things as theres always an equation that will let you draw the curve smoothly (unless its not differentiable, but never mind that for now). So the equation for the Bell shaped curve is Y=e\^(x\^2). That e is the exponential function and those hats mean to the power of. Now lets return to photons that left marks on the screen in the pattern of bands. So you can do somthing similar to what we did for the plot with the number of students and the marks they got. This time on the y axis instead of the number of students its the number of marks on the screen (which is a measure of light intensity) and on the x axis its distance measured from the half way point between the slits (moving right along the screen is +x , left is -x). So if we plot the number of photons at differrent distances a sort of wave like pattern appears. It likes look a series of hills and troughs with the height of each hill and the depth of each trough increasing as you get towards the point where x=0. This is the probability distribution for the location of the photon on the detector screen after it has left (scatters off) the double slit. Like the bell shaped curve it too has an equation which is y=cos\^2(gamma)sin\^2(alpha)/alpha\^2 where the alphas and gammas are angles related to where you are on the x axis. And that equation is also the same equation you get when you take 2 waves (where one wave is out of step with the other wave) and calculate the ratio of the amplitudes of both waves. So basically the probability distribution for where the photon will end up on the sceen has the same mathematical expression as the amplitudes of of 2 waves out of step divided by each other. So when its one photon at a time the interference pattern slowly builds up with the location of the photons following the probabilty distribution I just described. Now speed up the process so its millions of photons at a time. The intensity now is much greater but the photons still follow the same probabilty distribution as before except that it builds up so quickly (due to the miiilions of photons per second) that on the screen it looks like an interference pattern has just appeared there presumably from two waves interfering. But its actually photons following a probability distribution function for location that is similar to the function used to describe the ratio of amplitudes in the wave interference of 2 waves. And the reason you have this probability distribution is you cannot measure the location of the photon without losing information on a conjugate variable such as momentum. In fact it was recently shown that the so called wave particle duality is equivalent to a special type of uncertainty relation called an entropic uncertainty relation. []( And if you want a bit of deeper dive whilst keeping almost ELI5 check out the first 3 chapters of Feynmans Lectures volume 3 [\_01.html]( And to answer your ""observe"" question that's when a photon is detected on the screen. It leaves a mark/signal and so is ""observed""

Also there are quite a few of these ""interpretations"" of quantum mechanics the ""many worlds"" one being quite popular and the ""Copenhagen"" interpretation also being a favourite among many physicists. But all these things are just exercises in futility. The true ""interpretation"" of quantum mechanics is that it is a statistical theory (in that it uses probability distributions) that gives extremely accurate predictions with experiment.";0;9l1wd9;[]

I don't quite buy the 'breaks the 2nd law of thermo' though. However, QM does depart from traditional physics and it seems possible superconductivity could be key to lossless spin flips or whatever.";0;pq4u9l;[]

>The big advantage, though, is this scheme also allows something that looks like quantum routing. The basic process is that the photonic qubits are generated from matter qubits at one end and stored into matter qubits at a node. The storage process involves the emission of photons that can be used to determine the channel losses and appropriately decode the actual quantum data from the block. But, unlike point-to-point schemes, the decoding process doesn't involve measuring the quantum state, it only involves picking the right bits and performing operations on them. This is important, because a measurement would destroy the quantum state. Since the quantum state is preserved, it can be re-encoded in a new block and sent on to a new node.

Basically you need to know what a doppler shift is: ie. if you bounce light off something that's coming towards you, the frequency of the light coming towards you is shifted up, and if its going away from you, the frequency is shifted down.
In general when you have an object undergoing a motion described classically (tracing out some path) about a central position, it spends equal amounts of time going away from you as it does coming towards you (or else, it would be moving on average in a certain direction). So you'd expect the amount of light reflecting off of it which is doppler shifted to higher and lower frequencies to be exactly equal. When the object is cooled in its ``classical ground state'', it stops moving completely, so light reflecting off of it is neither shifted up, nor down in frequency. (there is of course nothing called a classical ground state, because a classical ground state would imply its position would be fixed, and its speed would be 0. this contradicts Heisenberg's uncertainty relation that states the speed and position of an object can't be well-known simultaneously.)
The ``quantum ground state'' is odd however, in that the object is then undergoing a motion which has no average direction to it, but can never lose energy to its environment (or light reflecting off of it). To shift the frequency of light up, one requires energy, and so less light is up shifted than down shifted. This is the asymmetry we set out to measure. The effect is distinctively nonclassical. By cooling the object to an average occupancy of around 2.5 phonons, we made the resonator cold enough that it spends roughly 30% of its time in quantum ground state, which is why we can observe this asymmetry.";0;p0iie;[]

This is because when an observer is present, the computer uses particles to render with maximum detail, but when the observer is not present the computer uses waves to conserve memory. If this is true, then we would also expect anti-matter to follow the same pattern because it is being rendered by the same computational process and limits. That is what this discovery means to me, anyway.
Edit: I say ""what this discovery means to me"" and want a discussion, yet all the replies are totally sure of themselves and more filled with insults than information.
Maybe the one piece of information in these replies is the idea the particle detector is the observer. But what does that mean really? It's a collision of a photon with atoms. An interaction of fields that can behave as waves when they're not colliding and particles when they are. And if that's wrong, I would love better information in a constructive way. Maybe this is a better way to articulate my thoughts about the experiment. I think it's showing that matter and anti matter are interactions of the same fields. Now, I imagine those fields as computational in how they interact. Conjecture? Sure. Impossible to prove? I doubt it.";0;bmc6mw;[]

Essentially, they use a neural network as an ansatz for a quantum many-body wave function instead of more tradiational anstze that have been used in theoretical chemistry since the birth of the field. The training of the network then amounts to what is traditionally called a Quantum Monte Carlo calculation, since it involves an optimization of the wavefunction (usually by minimizing the energy of the ground state of the system). Many groups have been working on such approaches for years now. The new aspect is that this group proposes a neural network architecture that explicitly incorporates the fundamental antisymmetry of the many-electron wave function (as demanded by the Pauli principle). Non-network anstze have been incorporating that since the birth of quantum mechanics, but how to best implement it in a network-based wave function such that it does not spoil the desired efficiency improvements of such an ansatz is active research. The PauliNet proposed by the authors of the original paper is one possible solution.;0;kp4lil;[]

I personally disagree, but there is no hard evidence one way or the other. And the primary defender of the idea in the article now or less asks that there can never be evidence for many worlds, when he says that they absolutely never interact with each other.

I work on DFT algorithms for nanoscale particles, but it's always cool seeing novel applications. A few things to point out:
1. While DFT was developed to model quantum systems there isn't much inherently ""quantum"" about it. The ""density functional"" part of the name gives a lot away actually. The whole purpose of the theory is to re-formulate complex interactions of objects in approximate terms based on the density of the interacting objects, which seems like a natural choice to model crowds behavior.
2. While the future applications section is getting a lot of attention, it is worth noting that the paper only studied highly controlled systems of fruit flies. Just a friendly reminder to consider the untested ambitions of researchers with skepticism and to pay attention to the actual methodology of their research.";0;9btcop;[]

These particles collide with the particles close to them, which in-turn causes them vibrate too. This movement propagates as sound waves. Our brain interprets these vibrations as sound. **What is a phonon?** A crystal is a solid in which the atoms are arranged in a highly ordered structure (e.g diamond). The vibrational energy of the atoms in a crystal propagates through the crystal as waves. A phonon is a discrete unit of vibrational energy in a crystal. The concept of a phonon is similar to that of a photon which is the discrete unit of light energy.
**Is a phonon a particle?** Phonons are referred to as quasi-particles. Quasi-particles describe a phenomenon, which considers excitations in solids as particles. As these particles do not consist of matter, they are called quasi particles.";0;cht3h7;[]

The next step is to figure out how to bring down the astronomical amount of energy needed to within the range of today's technologies, such as a large modern nuclear fission power plant. Then we can talk about building the first prototypes,"" says Lentz.
This paragraph would lead a lot of readers to the idea that the scale of energy required isn't so far away from what we can currently produce, whereas it's *a lot* further away from a current nuclear power plant than a cave man's fire is.
> Currently, the amount of energy required for this new type of space propulsion drive is still immense. Lentz explains, The energy required for this drive travelling at light speed encompassing a spacecraft of 100 meters in radius is on the order of hundreds of times of the mass of the planet Jupiter. The energy savings would need to be drastic, of approximately 30 orders of magnitude to be in range of modern nuclear fission reactors. He goes on to say: Fortunately, several energy-saving mechanisms have been proposed in earlier research that can potentially lower the energy required by nearly 60 orders of magnitude. Lentz is currently in the early-stages of determining if these methods can be modified, or if new mechanisms are needed to bring the energy required down to what is currently possible.
Since there's not a lot on what the energy saving methods are it's hard to judge what this work really means. However I wouldn't bother calling an engineer and asking for some energy just yet!";0;m1gyyi;[]

Im fairly certain they are simply referring to the barrier-bound which uses the Dyson equation. Its used to describe how subatomic particles move throughout flat space. Hawking then tried to apply the same equation to curved space surrounding a black hole so he could come up with a proper theory of his Hawking radiation which describes how black holes lose energy over time as well as separating particle pairs which can cause the information paradox which violates the laws of conservation of energy (energy cannot be created nor destroyed). The solution to that came in the form of the holographic principle which suggests that rather than living an a 3d world with a fourth dimension of time (3+1 dimensions) we live in a 2d dimension with 1 dimension of time (2+1 dimensions) and that our universe is actually a projection of that 2d image. This solves the information paradox because the information encoded on every subatomic particle is now no longer lost or destroyed but instead that information is encapsulated on the surface of the event horizon (from our perspective). In all reality the information actually passed through the event horizon but due to the way that gravity itself warps time, we dont get to see that. Whatever went in stops as it meets the event horizon. Regardless the information is never actually destroyed seeing as its stored on the surface of the black hole as well as having fallen IN to the black hole. This explains the relativity of time. Remember, space tells matter how to move, matter tells space how to bend.
All of this is important because I feel like their article may also be describing the double slit experiment which describes Einsteins spooky action at a distance which is now known as quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement shows us that by observing one particle, it seemingly can change a particle its entangled with from incredible distances which would violate the universal speed limit which is the speed of light. However, this was also explained in theory, due to the fact that it has nothing to do with the particles actually going faster than the speed of light. The reason being is because any time you go to measure one of those subatomic particles, the act of measuring it using electro magnetism (photons) changes its spin simply because youre firing a proton at it which is incredibly energetic and more or less massless allowing it to move at the speed of light. The fact that a particles spin is based on electromagnetism is why this disrupts the spin of the particles. I guess I should also say that particle pairs also will always try to remain neutral in regard to their charge. The universe itself always seeks neutrality to more or less balance the universal checkbook and make sure that information (Energy) is never created or destroyed. So how arent they violating the universal speed limit? The difference comes in the amount of time it takes from measuring the spin of these particles. Every time you measure one particle it changes its spin, however the time change is caused by the time it takes between the measurements because to know both you have to measure both, and with photons moving at the speed of light, there will always be a discrepancy in time because your measurements will always alter the state of the particle and the photons themselves are moving at the speed of light whereas the information being taken from the measurement of the particle moves slower than the speed of light. So why is that important? It shows that the particles arent violating the laws of physics meaning they arent going backward or forward in time. It keeps the arrow of time going in the same direction. Another way this is also explained can be seen using a Feynman diagram. Feynman diagrams show us what happens when two subatomic particles collide and what happens to the particles during that collision. The quantum world is weird in the sense of with Feynman diagrams you have to find all of the different possibilities that would explain the likelihood of what caused the particles that resulted from the collision to act as they did. The reason why its important to have ALL of the possibilities that could explain the result of the collision is because with subatomic particles you never actually know where they are with 100% accuracy. Its all probability based on where the particle could be. This is due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which states that you can never know both a particles location and spin at the same time. Whenever you know one its impossible to know the other. When the particle is stopped in order to be observed to know where its at, youre no longer able to tell how fast its moving, due to the fact that its frozen in time. The same can be said if you know a particles spin because for you to observe its spin, you wont have any idea of where its at because its moving at speeds approaching the speed of light, you cant actually pinpoint it.";0;cu871h;[]

Meaning:
* This reversal was not performed in a closed system, but was instead driven by a specific device.
* The second law of thermodynamics still holds in general for closed systems.
* The flow of time was not ever actually reversed in this system, however a quantum states evolution was successfully reversed. Its cool and useful, but it's not time travel.

The goal of quantum teleportation is to transfer a target state of a qubit C(a classical bit with superposition allowed, so infinitely many states possible) from Alice to Bob, without the qubit having to cross over the space between Alice and Bob. Before the teleportation process, we need:
1. The qubit C itself in the target state in Alice's possession.
2. Two more qubits, A and B, which are in possession of Alice and Bob respectively. A and B are to be in ""Bell states"" which are collective states of two qubits(there are four of these collective states, any one of them will do for this step). If entanglement is spooky action at a distance, then these Bell states are the spookiest of them all(maximally entangled).
3. A classical communication channel from Alice to Bob capable of sending two bits of information.
The teleportation process occurs in the following steps:
1. Alice performs a ""Bell state measurement"" on the qubits in her possession(A and C), collapsing them into one of four possible Bell states.
2. Due to the entanglement between Alice's and Bob's qubit, qubit B would collapse into a state that resembles the target state upon Alice performing her Bell state measurement. More specifically, B could end up in one of four possible states, one of which is the target state exactly and the other three are ""siblings"" of the target state that are ""flipped""(one unitary transformation away) in different ways compared to the target state. Bob does not yet know which state B is in, so at this stage there is only a 25% chance that the target state has been successfully teleported from C to B.
3. Alice then has to send the result of her Bell state measurement(ie which one of the four Bell states her qubits, A and C, collectively ended up in) to Bob via a classical channel.
4. To complete the teleportation, Bob takes Alice's information, and adjusts qubit B accordingly: depending on which one of four Bell state A and C are in, Bob will perform one of four corresponding ""unitary transformations"" on qubit B.
After these steps, qubit B would end up in the target state that qubit C started in, and the state of qubit C has been transferred to qubit B without any qubits crossing over from Alice to Bob.
Note that during this process, qubits A and C become entangled, so C will no longer be in the target state. Also, the entanglement between qubits A and B are destroyed, so you would have to prepare another entangled qubit pair for Alice and Bob if another teleportation is to be done.
Edit: some wordings, also the specific implementation of teleportation may be different, but the basic idea should be the same.";0;kpmur0;[]

The answer is that the fabric of the reality we live in is infomation, the manifestation of that information is probabilistic and statistical, and that measuring a particle in the same position when we believe it should be moving is not inconsistent with the rule set of this reality. What that means is that say you measure an atom in location A (or state A) at time A. Over time, say from time A until 1 hour after time A, the probability that the atom will have moved(or progressed from state A to state B) goes from 0% to 100% on a gradient.
Now, say you measure the particles at time A plus 30 minutes. The probablility that the atom has tunneled is 50%. So you may see it move or not. Either way would be consistent with the rules of reality. However, if the chance ends up landing on that it hadn't moved after 30 minutes, the probablility scale resets from time A, because we have once again observed the particle in state A, and the probability of the particle moving from state or location A to state or location B resets back to 0% to 100% over the next 1 hour.
It's not that we are necssarily ""suspending"" the motion of the particle by measuring it. It's that the closer you make a subsequent measurement of particle A in state or location A following the initial measurement at time A, the lower the probability that the particle will have changed its state or location. The probabilities of a change in state reset to 0 once you measure that the particle has remained in state/location A.
Such is the rule of a virtual reality.
EDIT: Decoherence theory is not a good answer as to why there should exist a probability distribution of particles(information) in the first place, or even why the probability collapses into reality upon measurement (if it was, quantum erasure experiments wouldn't work the way they do). And it definitely doesn't explain entanglement (non-locality).";0;3pw7xy;[]

""It is easy to show using standard theory that if a system starts in an eigenstate of some observable, and measurements are made of that observable N times a second, then, even if the state is not a stationary one, the probability that the system will be in the same state after, say, one second, tends to one as N tends to infinity; that is, that continual observations will prevent motion ""
This effect isn't as profound as I thought. It's essentially derived from the theory that if you observe an event that takes, say a second to finish, N times during the duration of the event (1 second), that 1 second will never finish. This makes sense, because to fit infinity observations into a time frame of one second doesn't make any real practical sense. Can someone help me understand why this quantum proof is of importance?

I would like to dispel this misconception. Perhaps in this experiment it was just light bouncing off of electrons, it's not clear. But in general even if the light does not interact with the electrons, we can still make a measurement of their position. Consider a scenario where an electron can be in one of two places, and you shine light on the place where the electron isn't, and you find that there is no electron there, then you have measured the position of the electron, without interacting with it. The quantum zeno effect applies to this scenario as well. Consider a tunneling experiment, where an electron is on one side of a very high potential, and it quantum tunnels through this barrier. Suppose there is some typical time scale where the electron is expected to tunnel through the barrier, say 1 second. According to quantum theory, if we measure the side of the potential where the electron isn't, by firing photons into the empty space, the electrons tunneling will be suppressed. This can not be understood as the photons interacting with the electron, it is a uniquely quantum effect where having **information** about the position of the electron plays a role in its physical behaviour. Or to put it another way, it appears as though merely the **potential** for interaction influences the behaviour of a system. From a philosophical and metaphysical perspective this is in fact completely unprecedented, very hard to get your head around, and totally undermines traditionally acceped world views.;0;3pw7xy;[]
