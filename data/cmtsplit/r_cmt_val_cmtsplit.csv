Just movement of particles as measured by a thermometer? It is no coincidence that good heat conductors are also good electrical conductors. But that doesnt really tell us anything about heat.

Like say, funding carbon capture, or funding widespread replacement of fossil fuels. It really seems like a failure of the imagination that the global community can't just tell itself carbon is a new currency, and everyone just go along with it.

This experiment was done with phosphorous atoms in a solid. In order to actually use those atoms as quantum bits (qubits) you have to be able to control them and have them interact with one another. Long life time and strong coupling are at odds with one another. To get strong coupling you need your qubit to have enough electric or magnetic field to be felt by the thing with which you want it to interact. On the other hand if the qubit interacts with stuff you didn't intend then you get bad coherence.
Atoms are really small and have weak electromagnetic properties. This makes it relatively easy to get high coherence times, but really really hard to get good coupling. A practical quantum computer must negotiate this trade-off properly.

So those specifics might have been wrong, that doesn't necessarily mean that his reasoning had no merit.

Electrons dont behave independently like, say, cue balls; quantum effects result in changes to one electron affecting the behaviour of the whole system, which may consist of any number of atoms. The number of equations required to describe increasingly large systems of electrons grows very rapidly, similarly to factorials. What the NN has done is to find hidden patterns between the separate equations to generate a small number of problems that describe the systems interactions identically.

[Google]( and [Cloudflare]( takes the quantum computing threat seriously along with the [NSA]( and [NIST]( I'd say these are folks that we could pay attention to.
For blockchain projects:
* QRL is natively post-quantum resistant ([Using XMSS, draft recommended by NIST \[pdf\]]( by default.
* QRL will be bringing the option to be post-quantum secure to Ethereum wallets with [enqlave.io]( \- just needs an audit!
* ADA seems interested in it, though opted for ECC for more features.
* Monero is [doing research](
* IOTA has it, but will be [switching to ECC ED25519]( as default for more features.
While quantum computers aren't going to break blockchains today, projects have a lot to do to prepare and it's not as straight forward as one might think as post-quantum crypto is [not likely going to be a drop-in replacement for ECC \[NIST/NCCoE\]]( Even assuming every project flicks a switch and instantly reaches a consensus, integrates everything, tests, audits, and releases their fork which gives the ability for post-quantum addresses, there's still the time to migrate. Seeing as that most are their own bank (not your keys, not your crypto!), only the end user can do their migration, and it can plausibly take a while. I don't recommend it, but conversely, your crypto would be safer on a centralized exchange in this scenario as they have staff on hand to handle the migration! This is the same scenario with banks - which are centralized with IT staff on hand to handle a migration, so also wont have a problem.
How long will it take for individuals to migrate when there's security ramifications? Well, we can take a look at Windows 7, which according to [Net Marketshare](, has a 22% marketshare as of 2020-08, which reached EoL in [2020-01]( This is in spite of the security risk, which Microsoft states clearly: ""Support for Windows 7 ended on January 14, 2020. If you are still using Windows 7, *your PC may become more vulnerable to security risks*"". It should be noted that at the time of that announcement... 26% of people were using Windows 7, so even after nearly a year there's been a change of \~4%.
If it takes 2 years to migrate (low estimate considering the above), then you're really looking at the time that ECC is broken and going backwards in time from that estimate. In this example, if it's broken in 2022, and it takes 2 years to migrate, you should have had post-quantum addresses ready by 2020 to start the migration, and as a friendly reminder that's not including consensus, development, testing, and audits. As certain blockchain features that rely on ECC are more difficult or infeasible to do with post-quantum crypto, this can negatively impact the development and migration timelines. [Quantum attacks on bitcoin, and how to protect against them gave 2027 as an optimistic estimate](
Even with that under consideration, on any given year it's not a 0% or 100% chance of being broken but instead has a cumulative probability. It also doesn't take into account the value of what's being broken. One of our community members put [together a model]( that articulates this. Put another way, is a 1% chance too high, 50%? That's going to depend on each individual and individual project. For 300 Billion of value, I'd like to think 1% is too high, while for a dog house, I doubt I'd even care if it had a 99% probability of being broken - [some dogs might have a different risk tolerance, however](
Michele Mosca, co-founder and deputy director of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, breaks down this risk assessment in [business terms pretty well](";0;ipn127;[]

Essentially, they use a neural network as an ansatz for a quantum many-body wave function instead of more tradiational anstze that have been used in theoretical chemistry since the birth of the field. The training of the network then amounts to what is traditionally called a Quantum Monte Carlo calculation, since it involves an optimization of the wavefunction (usually by minimizing the energy of the ground state of the system). Many groups have been working on such approaches for years now. The new aspect is that this group proposes a neural network architecture that explicitly incorporates the fundamental antisymmetry of the many-electron wave function (as demanded by the Pauli principle). Non-network anstze have been incorporating that since the birth of quantum mechanics, but how to best implement it in a network-based wave function such that it does not spoil the desired efficiency improvements of such an ansatz is active research. The PauliNet proposed by the authors of the original paper is one possible solution.;0;kp4lil;[]

[Here is an earlier presentation](, (the one I saw was more current, in that linked presentation he compares against a GPU system, (similar compute topology to large-core-count Intel sever CPU's) instead).
The D-Wave computer solves ONE and only ONE type of problem topology: the [Ising Spin Glass Problem]( Dr. Troyer analyzed the computer statistically against 3 topolgies:
- Simulated Quantum Annealing
- Simulated Classical Annealing
- One other that I can't remember (don't have notes with me).
The D-Wave system correlated HIGHLY against the simulated quantum annealing and quite low with the other two topologies. In my opinion, this is sufficient evidence, for now, to establish its credibility as a legitimately new system, and to validate their claims about HOW it operates.
What does NOT match up, however, are their claims about performance speedup. Dr. Troyer, using a server Intel CPU, (8 Core Xeon, with HT enabled) with optimized code, ran a speed test against various topologies of the Ising spin glass problem itself. He found that, with respect to wall-clock time, that not only does the D-Wave chip underperform in the small set size regime, but that, in the large set size regime, (something that you would use this 1000-qubit processor for), it scales almost identically to the Intel hardware, which is obviously, a small fraction of the cost of the D-Wave One/Two/whatever. In fact, there are certain problem topologies that it straight up can not solve within a reasonable time limit, (it is a heuristic solver, so that was almost expected), that the Intel CPU can, (though it takes substantially longer to do so than you would think).
TL;DR - IS a quantum annealer: inherently limited to one type of computation. Performs like shit anyways. Don't buy one unless you want to pump money into the ASIC fabrication supply chain, relating specifically to materials used for qubit systems, (pretty sure that's the only reason Google, etc are selling this so hard).
EDIT: 8 Core Xeon w/ HT. EDIT 2: My post may sound rather incriminating of D-Wave. IMO All of these efforts are useful, the modern CMOS architectures were not built in a day, or even a decade. However, D-Wave has been..... not careful.... when marketing itself, or allowing itself to be reported in the press. For years articles about its machines were mostly incoherent pieces of technobabble with nonsense claims. I think that kind of lackadaisical promotion is dangerous because it sows distrust.";0;1v2hpa;[]

It doesn't really gather any new information, it's like measuring a car's RPM and guessing if the cylinders are at top dead center or bottom dead center. Nothing of real significance is being measured in relation to superposition, thus being a weak observation.;0;10yemu;[]
