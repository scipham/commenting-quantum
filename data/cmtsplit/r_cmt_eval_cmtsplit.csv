>D-Wave founder Geordie Rose claims that D-Wave has now accomplished its goal of building a quantum computer that, in his words, is better at something than any other option available. This claim has been widely and uncritically repeated in the press, so that much of the nerd world now accepts it as fact. However, the claim is not supported by the evidence currently available. It appears that, while the D-Wave machine does outperform certain off-the-shelf solvers, **simulated annealing codes have been written that outperform the D-Wave machine on its own native problem when run on a standard laptop**. More research is needed to clarify the issue, but in the meantime, it seems worth knowing that this is where things currently stand.

Some argue that Dark Matter is real, and it is in fact a kind of matter... a kind of ""stuff""... most likely made up of a type of particle we haven't discovered yet. It is believed to be a particle that has mass (thus gravity), but doesn't interact very strongly with regular matter or light. --------------------------------
Others argue that it is NOT actual matter or stuff, but rather some kind of strange property of the Universe. They usually argue it is some kind of misunderstanding of gravity, just as this latest article is trying to do, by arguing that gravity is somehow an emergent phenomena of quantum entanglement, or quantum effects of some sort. --------------------------------
But... the problem is... is that there is ever increasing evidence that points towards Dark Matter as being real stuff. A kind of undiscovered particle most likely, that has mass. --------------------------------
One of the big problems with the opposite theories, that say there is NO such thing in space known as ""Dark Matter""...
Is that we've actually used Dark Matter for scientific purposes! Yes, we've made use of it, before we even understand what it is! Essentially we've used Dark Matter to act as a giant gravitational lens, to enhance and magnify distant objects behind the Dark-Matter cloud. And sure enough, Dark Matter functions perfectly as a gravitational lens, in exactly the same way regular matter functions as a gravitational lens. --------------------------------
There is also other evidence that Dark Matter is real ""stuff"", such as the fact that we've recently discovered galaxies with no Dark Matter effects. So if you're going to argue that the effects of Dark Matter is an inherent property of the Universe, or a misunderstanding of gravity (rather than actual material stuff) then why do some places in the Universe appear not to have that inherent property you are trying to argue for? Essentially properties and forces work the same throughout the Universe. But matter is not spread out evenly in the Universe. --------------------------------
So again... if Dark Matter was a property or force, then you would see it acting the same on ALL galaxies. But some galaxies have virtually no Dark Matter effects what-so-ever. In cases like that it makes much more sense to awesome Dark Matter is real stuff, and that the concentration of that stuff is simply lower in some parts of the universe, and higher in other parts of the universe (just as ""normal"" matter also concentrates). --------------------------------
FURTHER... The oscillation of the Cosmic Microwave Background supposedly provides very strong support to the idea that Dark Matter is stuff. If Dark Matter was not stuff the oscillation would be different. (Admittedly I personally don't really understand that particular oscillation-evidence, as it's not something I've read up on yet.) --------------------------------
There's yet more evidence for Dark Matter as ""stuff"" and a ""particle"" but I'll stop here!
In short, the vast majority of astrophysicists I tend to follow seem increasingly more certain that Dark Matter is real matter... A strange kind of matter we do not yet understand...
But matter that we've already been able to use to our advantage (such as gravitational lensing)!

there's a lot in there that's a lot more subtle and depends precisely on which space we're talking about (de sitter space, anti desitter space, real space...) that I have not satisfactorily described but I believe this to be the essence of the argument
it would be very interesting to see whether the ultra diffuse galaxy lacking dark matter mentioned elsewhere in the thread is above or below this acceleration scale, which presumably is how it was inferred no dark matter exists in that galaxy, though someone more familiar with the matter can perhaps elaborate on how that conclusion was drawn";0;8hr8en;[]

Physicist here, phonons and photons are the same kind of particle at theoretical level. Both are excitations of fields - photon the electromagnetic field while, phonons quantum electronic fields of periodic potential (lattice) Just like any other quantum particles both can be created and destroyed while also existing in other weird combination of those creation and destruction. Phonons are very well understood objects and Infact one of the main reasons for superconductivity in materials. Phonons have very major role in lot a of everyday technologies, right from solar cells to semiconductors. For instance, these phonon particles can interact with electrons in solid and entirely change the property of the material. Phonons are most prominent at higher temperatures (since they are excited states of lattice vibrations, higher the temperature more the lattice jiggles and more energy the phonon gets). Its very comon in physics to model excited states of systems as particles, for instance, there are excited states of a particle made up of both photon and phonon- it is called polariton and an excited state of photon and exciton ( exciton is electron and positron combined) which is called a polaron and so on. They beauty of quantum physics is that when you combine elementary particles (electrons) they interact so complexly that they give birth to new quasi particles which can be described (to a very good approximation) as non interacting particles. For further reading, read about the beautiful idea of emergence in condensed matter physics
I have got tons of messages asking about other quasi particles. Heres not so exhaustive list of em. -	Fermi electrons -	Phonons
-	Cooper pairs -	Excitons -	Polrons -	Polritons -	Weyl fermions -	Dirac fermions
-	Nodal fermions
-	Majorana fermion. You read it right ! Last one is the most esoteric of the lot as it is its own antiparticle. Its as of now a theoretical construct and these are very very hard to isolate and observe. Once found experimentally , these are the perfect candidates for Qi it for quantum computing without a shadow of doubt and probably will fetch you a noble prize too!

Even if there is a form of cryptology out there that is beyond cracking, at the end of the day you still have to trust the person who gives that encryption technique to you that it is what it says on the tin.
There is a reason why the state has not acted alone: because the cryptology CAN defend itself. So instead, we have the state force corporations to tweak the mathematical methods of that encryption in their favour upon pain of legal fury. And you would be none-the-wiser when Windows demands another OS update at the bottom-right of your screen.
The problem is still at the end of the day, authoritarian power, as it always has been. It is wrong to assume that the internet can bring democracy. Not when China can set up fake-opposition blogs to lure dissenters into a trap where their IPs can be caught and hence be arrested. Not when Islamic fascists can crowdsource YouTube videos to identify street protesters and have the secret police on them. Not when a regime can get desperate and fire rockets into the servers of the ISPs. Not when copyright law still encourages a Luddite backlash from corporations against the decentralisation of data via file-sharing BitTorrents. Not when the revelation of dissenters in Afghanistan fighting against the Taliban can spread around the world within seconds.
What brings about resisting totalitarianism is the old-fashioned stuff: freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, separating religions from the state, revealing who you are to the world and that your name means business (so anonymity is a utopian idea, too), organising marches, breaking certain laws, and of course using military force against your state to bring about a revolution if need be.

I went to read the paper and began trying to track down the citations that were being used to support their statements and it doesn't look good.
Just in the introduction, we have *Quantum mechanisms are at work in sensory systems feeding the brain with information \[13\]. Foremost in magneto-reception \[4\], there is no doubt that only quantum mechanical effects can explain its sensitivity \[3\].*
Which alone, seems to check out from their source. But the authors try to extend that reasoning with:
*Beyond those sensory inputs, more complex brain functionalities depend on the presence of specific nuclear spins.* Which does not follow. Just because a sensory system utilizes quantum effects, doesn't imply that a system further down the line NECESSARILY uses them as well. I'm sure the birds with quantum-magneto senses also have feet. If I was applying similar logic, I would say that since their feet are connected, they must also have quantum feet. (wheeee) The paper words this in a sneaky way, introducing an irrelevant fact but encouraging the reader to take the presented logical deduction forward.
*For example, Lithium-6 isotopes with nuclear spin 1 increase activity of* *complex behaviour in contrast to Lithium-7 isotopes with 3/2 spin where* *it decreases \[5\]*
The citation mentions a study on rats (which are not human), and indeed uses Li6 and Li7 to observe that Li6 treated mice become helicopter rat moms and Li7 treated mice abandon their children. The mice authors never attribute this effect to nuclear spin. It's also difficult to argue that helicopter parenting is ""increased activity of complex behavior"", which is a word salad to begin with.";0;y8t01q;[]

But saying the universe is made from ""fundamental building blocks like pixels"" is ridiculous. What if you take the space one of those pixels entails (lemme guess the plank length) and then you STRETCH that space to one meter? That could happen in our universe. My amateur philosophy is any measurable space contains some trace of energy. The energy and the space are both divisible infinitely. There can be consciousness on a scale infinitely smaller than ours which would consider that one meter you are looking at to actually be infinite. It's called relativity.

Quite remarkably, the best piece of physics done by the three people you mention is Hawkings black-hole radiation, which is exactly this. But most of current theoretical physics is not of this sort. Why? Largely because of the philosophical superficiality of the current bunch of scientists.
He's saying that philosophical idiocy is harming physics, not that philosophy is required for physicists to do good physics. EDIT: Also, the musings of one physicist working in an already kind of fringe area of physics does not really hammer home proof or support one way or the other.";0;2e9qe8;[]

It's also worth pointing out that there are good reasons its a minority research program: any would-be theory of quantum gravity that can't verifiably reproduce general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits really hasn't succeeded in satisfying the first criteria to be taken seriously as a viable contender, and LQG doesn't fulfil either of these requirements.
Anyway as for whether Philosophical Superficiality has harmed physics, I don't think he's said anything remotely convincing on the subject. Everything he says in this paragraph pretty much boils down to the fact that he wishes more researchers would choose his research program, and so he thinks that if theorists were just thinking more deeply or more philosophically, then more of them might agree with him (a dubious notion if you ask me).
So all in all, the link really doesn't contain much of anything meaningful about philosophy. It's more an attempt to invoke philosophy to argue for ideas that otherwise haven't convinced the theoretical physics community.";0;2e9qe8;[]

Well I mean that seems likely, but a 20 year turnaround time for speculative fundamental physics of any kind is ridiculously fast. That's not really a critique of string theory per-se, because the same is almost certainly true of LQG and everything else people are looking at.

> Knig and his colleagues have now conclusively demonstrated the advantage of quantum computers. To this end, they developed a quantum circuit that can solve a specific difficult algebraic problem. The new circuit has a simple structure: it only performs a fixed number of operations on each qubit. Such a circuit is referred to as having a constant depth. In their work, the researchers prove that the problem at hand cannot be solved using classical constant-depth circuits.
This tells you virtually nothing. You can carry out fats, approximate calculations using a nomogram or two elastic bands which require a digital computer to use a linear program or similar. However, one of these has a link to a AAAS Scince article [here](
> We show that parallel quantum algorithms running in a constant time period are strictly more powerful than their classical counterparts; they are provably better at solving certain linear algebra problems associated with binary quadratic forms. Our work gives an unconditional proof of a computational quantum advantage and simultaneously pinpoints its origin: It is a consequence of quantum nonlocality. The proposed quantum algorithm is a suitable candidate for near-future experimental realizations

In the currently accepted expansion model of our universe, a point in ""real-time"" at which there is a singularity is required, which can be a difficult thing to deal with when attempting to discern a ""beginning"" because the laws of physics break down at one. However, to put it simply, imaginary time allows us to avoid this conundrum by visualizing time as just another direction in space, ergo euclidian spacetime, wherein the singularity we saw prior is just another point in 4D spacetime.
The example used in ""A Brief History of Time"" to visualize this is to imagine a sphere with North and South poles, not unlike the earth, with lines of latitude radiating evenly outwards. In this, the North represents the earliest point in imaginary time, and the South the latest, and the size of the latitude lines (which get progressively bigger as you reach the equator of this sphere) represent the size of the universe with respect to this imaginary time. Moving from North to South, we start at a single point (the North Pole) meant to represent a singularity prior to the Big Bang, but instead of our real-time notion of a singularity, in imaginary time, it's just another point. The same thing applies for the South Pole of this model, meant to represent the ""Big Crunch"".

Whether the math proves it to be true is irrelevant, the math itself is indeed imaginary as well. Our entire understanding of the way the universe works are based on observations that we have been entirely contaminating by even observing their existence. Since it's impossible to actually know the exact location and trajectory of a particle until we measure it there is no factual way of determing if that particle simply stopped to be observed or if that was its intended measurements before observation occurs. How can we be sure that we ourselves are not acting as particles to the 4th dimensional observer? These subatomic materials clearly have enough sentience ro be aware of their observation and act according to our presence because there holds a direct correlation between our imaginary numbers and these particles. There's no mistake that these particles are giving us the information and feeding it to us through some unseen link between the immaterial and the material. The very existence of dark matter suggests an invisible force guiding all things through the observable universe. It's my theory that not only does the God particle exist but it is a product of the interaction when dark matter and matter are able to meet at the exact same frequency. Since dark matter is immensely difficult to produce and there is only a finite amount it is near impossible to get accurate findings that can be called conclusive and until we have reached a higher level civilization that progress will only be at a crawl pace. Modern scientists have recently discovered 11 new packets of dimensions that are all geometrically different in their measurements and this was through the observations they've made on dark matter, the quantized world around us, and even space itself. We are moving beyond the world of science fiction and into the field of general accepted theory friends. Our world, our universe grows bigger and bigger each second and with our observations those growths get larger and larger. This universe is alive, and aware of us, just as we are alive and aware of the quantum world inside of us.;0;rh3nji;[]

I work with Majorana fermions (theoretically). To put this into context:
[This research]( provides very high quality experimental evidence for the existence of Majorana bound states.
Majorana bound states arise in certain superconductors. Superconductivity is an inherently quantum mechanical phenomenon, where electrons form pairs, which then do weird quantum stuff. So, if you want to build a quantum computer, superconductors are a good place to look.
Describing majorana bound states as a ""half-electron"" is a bit, well, not quite misleading, but not a good idea either. For instance, they have no electric charge. A more accurate description would be: A majorana bound state is to an electron what the real and imaginary part are to a complex number.
The fact that Majorana bound states could be useful for quantum computation was first pointed out by [A. Kitaev in 2000][1]. This was a fairly theoretical idea until, in 2010, there were [two][2] [suggestions][3] that Majorana fermions should be present in certain systems that we can actually realize in the laboratory. Early reports, [like in 2012][4], claimed to have done this, but the evidence was not that good. Now it's 2018, and we're finally seeing high quality experiments that work as the theory suggested about a decade ago. So, yes, the progress is great, but it's been a long road almost 20 years in the making.
I've heard the story that some time after hearing about Majorana bound states, [Michael Freedman][5] approached Bill Gates and asked whether he would fund this approach to building a quantum computer. Today, Microsoft is indeed paying top dollar to pursue this. My guess is that it will still take > 10 years to actually build a quantum computer. [1]: [2]: [3]: [4]: [5]: ";0;88i5eq;[]

Also, does quantum connectivity of separate pairs persist into or through a black hole? I imagine it breaks at the event horizon.
Why doesn't a black hole keep growing by sucking up virtual particles from the vacuum sea over the eons? (Instead of evaporating through Hawking radiation?)
NS article notes ""In this new model, the gravitational field still increases as you near the black hole's core.""
To me that implies that black holes have increasing density as you approach the 'core'. But if the core were immensely high density, how could it be a gateway out of this universe?

1) How, precisely, is such a state change detected? 2) Wouldn't such a state-change measurement collapse the wave function of photon B? If so, how could such a timing measurement be made, since multiple state change measurements have to be made to determine the timing?
3) If you really could detect when photon B transitioned from ""no definite state"" to ""definite state"" due to the collapse of photon A's wavefunction, you'd have a way to transmit information faster than the speed of light: using a lineup of photons A1, A2, A3, ... entangled with B1, B2, B3, ..., you could vary the time between collapses of A series photons to transmit binary information, and detect those variances by detecting those state changes using the B series photons.";0;1bavah;[]

We are treated to: ""Tang....Tang.....Tang....Tang....Tang"". In fact the occurrence of ""Tang"" becomes one of those things you can't unsee once you realize what is going on.
So much unnecessary political correctness. What if I am a potential teenager girl the same age as Tang interested in computer science, and I could have been inspired by her.

But the quantum computers we have now are error-prone and don't have enough qubits to allow for error correction. The only demonstrations we've had involve quantum computing hardware evolving out of a random configuration and traditional computers failing to simulate their normal behavior. Useful calculations are an exercise for the future.
But a new paper from Google's quantum computing group has now moved beyond these sorts of demonstrations and used a quantum computer as part of a system that can help us understand quantum systems in general, rather than the quantum computer. And they show that, even on today's error-prone hardware, the system can outperform classical computers on the same problem.";0;v9wj42;[]

Let's assume that your are living on the East Coast and that you have friend on the West Coast. Let's furthermore assume, that you have a common friend living somewhere in Iowa.
Your friend in Iowa has two bottles with marbles: One bottle with red marbles, another bottle with blue marbles. Your friend picks two marbles from one bottle. Therefore both marbles have the same color (which you don't know yet) and represent entangled photons for our thought experiment.
Now your friend in Iowa sends each of you a package with one of the two ""entangled"" marbles, that both have the same color. The package arrives and you know, that there's a marble in the package. You don't know the color of the marble. For you the color of the marble could be anything. You only know that the marbles you and your friend have received have the same color.
You open the package and find a blue marble and you know immediately, that your friend has received a blue marble as well. That's, um, obvious and on a basic level everything that happens with quantum entanglement. But how can you use that phenomenon to tell your friend, that you will visit him in two weeks?
The answer is: You can't! The marble of your friend won't immediately change from blue to red, when you paint your marble red, but that would be necessary to establish a communication through quantum entanglement. You can only tell your friend to paint his marble red too, but that has to happen with a conventional communication device, that cannot exceed the speed of light. --- ---
In quantum mechanics things are bit different and more complicated of course. In quantum mechanics the package can contain more than just one marble, and the marbles can have different shapes and colors. And you don't need a friend in Iowa to make sure, that you don't know the content of the package until you open the package. Quantum mechanics do that for you. When you open the package, you receive a random result. And once you have opened the package, you can change the content as much as you want, it won't affect the content of the other package. That's not how quantum entanglement work.
But it's even worse in quantum physics: The content of the package is also determined by how you open the package. Open the package at midnight and you receive a marble. Open the package in the morning and you may find a dice. The troublesome but also interesting thing (for cryptography and quantum computers) is, that the content of the package can be BOTH even after you and your friend have opened the packages (in quantum mechanics ""opening the package"" means measuring the state of the particles in a specific way). Let's assume that you open the package at midnight and find a marble. The package of your friend and the West Coast contains a marble as well? Yes, but only of our friend opens his package at midnight as well. But if he opens his package in the morning, he will find a dice. To make sure that you both find a marble, you'd have to tell your friend, that he has to open his package at midnight, and that can - you guessed it already - only happen through conventional communication devices.
Superluminal communication via quantum entanglement is impossible because you always need an additional communication channel, that cannot exceed the speed of light. And teleportation is impossible as well since you can't modify the photon and it's entangled twin. Quantum entanglement simply doesn't work that way (and it will never; that's not just a technological barrier).

While scientist work an quantum computers, they will also work on post quantum cryptography - and there is no fundamental reason a normal computer won't be able to use a quantum resistant encryption algorithm.
However scientists like this are mostly over-optimistic with time, and as someone who works in science myself I can tell you this has mostly to do with funding. If you are honest about expecting results in 30 years, you will have a hard time to get money. As far as I know quantum computers are nowhere near cracking actual encryption.
ALSO... The article claims SHA-256 will be broken, and I'm not aware of any quantum algorithm that could crack SHA-256. There is a realistic threat in quantum computers breaking elliptic curve functions (asymmetric cryptography, getting private keys from public keys). However in blockchains like BTC, addresses are generated by hashing from public keys and the pub. keys are only published once you spend. This means even BTC is ""sort-of"" quantum resistant today if you never reuse addresses.";0;10i8mgp;[]

Existing Blockchain technology could face a fatal impact. So, current blockchains will require their own migration. This will likely take the form of a fork or a protocol update, creating a new post-quantum chain or addresses and a limited window of time for users to migrate their data and assets. Even if everyone takes the same protection measures, quantum computers might eventually become so fast that they will undermine the Bitcoin transaction process. In this case, the security of the Bitcoin blockchain will be fundamentally broken. The only solution, in this case, is to transition to a new type of cryptography called post-quantum cryptography.

Using weak measurements, however, it is possible to operationally define a set of trajectories for an ensemble of quantum particles. >We sent single photons emitted by a quantum dot through a double-slit interferometer and reconstructed these trajectories by performing a weak measurement of the photon momentum, post-selected according to the result of a strong measurement of photon position in a series of planes. The results provide an observationally grounded description of the propagation of sub-ensembles of quantum particles in a two-slit interferometer.
The most remarkable diagram is shown [here]( These contours reconstruct the average trajectories of single photons as they move from one slit (not both) to their strike on the detector. The conceptual implications of this are considerable, but I won't explore them here.

This is something nobody does because CCSD is one of the most accurate and expensive methods in quantum chemistry and using a minimal basis guarantees that the result isn't going to be useful. If you look at figure 3b their error reaches 0.02 Hartree, which is very far from what we call [chemical accuracy]( - about 0.0016 Hartree. Actually, more accurate calculations were done in the [1960s]( an back then Koos and Wolniewicz didn't even use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The authors of this article did some ground-breaking work inventing algorithms to employ quantum annealing for electronic structure calculations, which is awesome, but they purposefully chose a simple problem (using a minimal basis they have just one parameter to optimize) to find out which one of their two alternative approaches works better. The pop-sci article is full of shit and calling these calculations accurate is laughable.;0;4uhlc3;[]

Most of the cosmos in space and in time is too hot or too cold or too dense or too sparse or too chaotic or too stagnant for life. Even in this precious moment and special place we call Earth there have already been 5 major extinctions. The last one was 65million years ago and wiped out the colossal dinosaurs. 99% of species have been previously wiped out. Just a few years ago a tsunami wiped out 200,000 of us in a single day. That's .03% of our population because of a splash of water. While we are the most knowledgeable beings ever to have lived on Earth and can possibly detect meteors and comets on a collision course and change their trajectories and to some extent foresee conditions build up for likely tornadoes, hurricane paths, earthquakes, tsunamis we are also smart enough to build nuclear weapons and disrupt the climate and poison our own water supply. Even if we can survive these natural and man made hazards the sun will one day engold our planet and the Milky Way will collide with andromeda and the universe will expand to near absolute zero temperatures. The feelings of altruism, love, sympathy are all programmed into our DNA to help those close to us, most especially our children, as they carry our genes. An AI has no genes. It knows not love for a child. It has no feelings. It has no fear. It understands not pain. Those are things that eventually could be programmed into it but it's a tricky endeavor that can backfire on us. Eventually it will have no need for us. In fact, it may find that we may be consuming some of the same resources it will need. It may see us as we see bacteria or viruses. A virus is arguably not even a living thing. A super general purpose AI would consider us barely conscious. We can only see what's directly in front of us. We barely remember the things we've learned in college. We can only read one item at a time. Our communication is slow and limited. A higher being could kill us with no remorse. We are by comparison, nothing special. So I am not sure that they would have our best interest in mind in the long run. Some of the best minds have been tackling this AI issue and feel that one way or another it eventually does not end well for us. But if we can create this super being that can thrive and go on in space and time far beyond what we could have ever dreamed of with our limited minds and bodies then maybe it's time we pass on the baton and let the universe know itself better than we could have ever begun to imagine. ;0;4uhlc3;[]

Currently, the fastest quantum computer (that isn't even market available yet) can do 2^(53) possible combinations of bits in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. It would take 2^(203) cycles to be able to break Bitcoin private and public addresses and render them useless. That would be the equivalent to roughly 8.15 10^(15) years to perform such an operation . In that time, Bitcoin could easily just add more possible addresses through another hardfork which changes the address format. Using Moore's Law, we can expect the rate of improvement of quantum computers to double every two years. Even if that happens, it will take 406 years to be able to completely break Bitcoin.

Quantum Key Distribution, QKD, is mathematically proven to be indecipherable. This is *without* making any assumptions on Eve (the attacking eavesdropper), but only a few on Alice and Bob (sender and receiver).
What QKD does is use qubits to create a one-time key to a cypher. This key is created using quantum mechanics (perfectly random) and privacy amplification (shortening the random key using classical cyphers) to create something that cannot be duplicated except by random chance. Once you have your key, you can use that to create a message which is indecipherable.
What that means is that the only way for someone to control what is being sent or received has to physically take over the material sending and receiving the qubits. Why is that? Why is the only way to beat QKD is to physically take over both the sender and receiver? Because of QBER.
QBER is the Quantum Bit Error Rate. It is a number which is more or less unique to each QKD communication line. This is a gross simplification, but it can be understood as the % of times a qubit being sent is modified by the environment. If you have Eve trying to find out what Alice is sending to Bob, she will have to measure the qubits and will end up changing their state. This increases the QBER, which can be detected by both Alice and Bob, and means that they can stop exchanging the key and figure out what is happening.
Since no actual message has been sent, only a key, even if Eve gets any parts of that key, she doesnt actually gain any information since there was no message. Alice and Bob can keep on making new keys until the QBER is at a number which tells them there are no opponents listening in. This method is perfectly unhackable.";0;ny3z76;[]

Neither of these are true - quantum computers certainly can't compete with regular computers for every problem, but there's a rapidly growing list of real-world problems that we know they'll be useful for. Here's a few:
* **Molecular simulation.** Microsoft Research, for example, want to use this problem to design cheap, ecological fertilizers, but others are interested in drug design and materials science (inc. room temp superconductors).
* **Search.** This could just be used for searching through lists of data, but is a more generic tool for just brute-force searching for an answer to a particular hard problem.
* **Optimisation.** The quantum search algorithm gives a modest advantage for optimisation problems on a quantum computer, but is a bit of a blunt tool; researchers have recently written down some quantum algorithms for solving commonly encountered optimisation problems (e.g. semidefinite programs). Early days, but looks promising.
* **Network/graph problems.** Really interesting class of problems if you want to efficiently direct internet traffic, or run a logistics company, or understand biological/sociological networks... the list is endless. There have been lots of new quantum algorithms recently for solving graph problems more quickly, including a gem of a paper on [the travelling salesman problem]( * **Simultaneous equations.** A quantum algorithm for speeding up simultaneous equation solving was published in '09: [Here]( Useful on its own, but is probably going to find more application as a subroutine for machine learning/AI problems.
* **Differential equations.** Among other things, differential equations are ubiquitous in engineering; and solving them numerically is important if, say, you want to model air flow through a turbine, or heat in an engine, or stress on a skyscraper. Here's a paper showing that [quantum computers can be faster at solving differential equations](
* **Monte Carlo methods.** These methods are currently used to help solve a wide-range of problems where some statistical or probabilistic element is involved, e.g. weather forecasting/climate modelling, AI, computational biology and computer graphics (the wiki page has a more [complete list]( Quantum computers have an advantage here, too: [Quantum monte carlo](
* **Machine learning / AI.** There have been lots of published papers outlining specific machine learning tasks that can be sped up by quantum means, but the quality tends to vary wildly. One of my favourites is [a quantum algorithm for the ""Netflix problem""](, where a computer has to recommend new products based on a user's review of things they've already purchased. [Here]( is a decent review of machine learning/AI applications of quantum computers.
Here's a great review, for those interested:

No quantum physicists would have believed this couldn't be done. Quantum teleportation is very well studied and has been performed in labs all over the world using different methods, whether its done with photons (light), atoms or other means. Quantum teleportation is the spiffy name given to a particularly clever method of transferring a quantum state from one particle to another using entangled particles as intermediaries (its not as exciting as it sounds, until you learn more about quantum mechanics; it then becomes more exciting). The difference with these groups is that they performed this experiment with photons that they first passed through a relatively long fiber optic cable. The experiment has been done before with one of the photons passing through a fiber optic cable; in this case both photons did. It may sound underwhelming, but its an important milestone towards connecting distant quantum networks.

They are performing 2 or 3 measurements in a row. If a result of second is bigger than expected, then it's the 3rd measurement interfering backwards in time with 2nd. Okay. What were the results of 2nd measurement when they *didn't* perform the third one? Thanks for asking, the results were *also bigger than expected*. The only difference was this: if they did perform 3rd, the results of 2nd are bigger because 3rd caused them to; if they didn't the results are bigger because of experimental error in apparatus or whatever.

But the way I understand it is that the two particles are somehow intrinsically linked; it's not that one particle is communicating with the other in some way that implies a transmission of information faster than the speed of light, but rather the particles are moving at exactly the same moment, which suggests that they are connected in a way that does not need any physical transmission of data, which to me implies some other realm of connection that we perhaps don't know of yet. Some type of connection between particles (perhaps all particles?) that is a basic element of how the universe is made up, that we do not yet understand, and is more fundamental than our ideas of object A having to travel through space and time in order to communicate with object B.

could that somehow be related to the quantum entanglement stuff? like maybe that particle way over there eventually becomes a particle that's a part of me in the future, which is why noting my particles causes that one to instantly change. because it's eventually a part of me, or according to (my version of) the 4th dimension, it already is a part of me.

Lets say you want to transmit a message over an extremely long distance, light years for example.
The message is a simple Boolean yes or no. One particle is sent with whomever is going to be at the destination, the other stays with you. (And yes, were talking spherical cows in a vacuum style hypothetical.)
So qubit A goes to get lost in space, qubit B stays home.
At some point, you want to send a message to qubit A. So you microwave qubit B until it has the proper orientation. Since A and B are entangled, A must also change to match the change in B, and this is done instantly, potentially far faster than the speed of light, depending on how far A and B are from each other.
So not only does this break the standard model (again hypothetically) but it also implies that the speed of light is not the limit for the transmission of any kind of information or state-change.

&#x200B;
As a few people have pointed out I did not explain the second part of the double slit experiment. So here goes. In every experiment that has been carried out where the experimenter tries to determine which slit the photon passes through the interference that is already present on the screen is disrupted and the pattern that emerges is more like a smudging of particle detections spread out symmetrically from the center line of the detector screen with more particle detections closer to the centerline. In the case of the quantum eraser experiments as the photon continues along its path after the path has been determined another optical element takes away the which path information and as if by magic the interference pattern (multiple bands) reappears. So what the hell is going on then? How can that happen? Like I said at the beginning of my original comment all of this (wave-particle duality, where did the inteference patten go?, quantum eraser, observation) are all consequences of the uncertainty relationships (basically not being able to measure precisely where the particle is).
&#x200B;
Lets clear up whats happening when people talk about observing in relation to the double slit experiment. Bohr provided the solution to why the interference pattern disapperars when the experimenter attempts to probe the experiment and determine which slit the photon went through (This was during the Bohr-Einstein debates, possibly the reddit of its day, years and years ago, although back then it was called The Solvay conferences :D). So back to the explaination. In order to detect which slit the photon goes through any sort of device (microscope, laser, another much smaller detector screen, etc) must by its very nature use another particle to gain information about the photon. This other particle will impart whats called a momentum kick. Its like when youre playing pool (aka billards) or snooker and the white ball hits another colored ball. The white ball (depending on the initial conditions and they can be adjusted to get the desired result) will stop thus indicating some information about the other ball such as location or velocity. However a consequence of hitting that coloured ball is that its momentum has now changed. This is basically a momentum kick and something quite similar happens with the photons and the probing particle. Now it turns out (and this has been verified experimenatlly over and over by many different experiments) that the least amount of momentum required by the probing particle to obtain sufficient information to definintely say which slit it went through exceeds the limit defined in the uncertainty relationship for keeping the interfreence pattern intact or coherent.
&#x200B;
What is this uncertainty relationship? Well this is it. \[ deltaP x deltaQ > or = 0.5 hbar \]. Now ""deltaP"" is the uncertainty in momentum and ""delatQ"" is the uncertainty in position (the deltas mean really really small). hbar is also a really really small number (Plancks constant divided by 2pie). What the uncertainty relation is saying is, that if you multiply the uncertainties in postion and momentum by each other for the photon that you want to obtain information from, as long as the uncertainties when multiplied togteher are bigger than 0.5 times hbar, then the interference pattern will remain intact. However, the least amount of momentum for the probing particle you can use to get a sensible answer for the location of the photon changes the uncertainty in momentum by an amount such that on multiplying by the unceratinty in position the number that should be bigger than 0.5 times hbar for the interference pattern to remain intact now becomes smaller than 0.5 hbar and so the interference pattern is disrupted. But wait? What happend to the probabilty distributions I was taliking about earlier that define the interence pattern. Well another name for those uncertainties is standard deviation and the standard deviation is all you need to know to compare different probabilty distributions. The interference pattern is the probabilty distribution for the location. However it is connected to the probability distribution for the momentum by way of the uncertainty relation so a change in the momentum probability distribution will affect the location probability distribution. In the case of the probing particle the change is enough to affect the coherencnce of both distributions (deltaP X deltaQ < 0.5 hbar) and disrupt the interference pattern in both. And that is why the interference pattern turns into a smudge.
&#x200B;
But how does the interference pattern come back in those quantum erasure experiments? Well to answer that we need to know about the work of Berge Englert. He came to realise that in these double slit wave particle situations you can define quantities specifcally for the wave (interference) part and the particle (which way) part all derived from the uncertainty relations. Essentially he found you could define the wave interference by whats called the phase of the wave (the phase is a number that tells you how much out of step the two waves are in relation to each other). He called this quantity V for the visibility of the interference bands. Now for the particle part they used a measure of intensity which is the number of particles hitting the screen according to the location proabability distribution. He called this quantity D for path distinguishability. And then he found another inequality that related D and V. So there was a limit on how much of D you could have in relation to V. And that relationship is this D\^2 + V\^2 < or = 1.
&#x200B;
Now if this looks a bit frightening let me put your mind at rest. Remember Pythagoruss theorem? X\^2 + Y\^2 = Z\^2 for one of those 90 degree triangles. Its the same thing with D\^2 + V\^2 =1. Well now imagine a circle with a radius thats just the number 1. For the sake of simplicty imagine a line drawn along the radius from the center so that it crosse the circle boundary. kinda like this (\\ ). Now if you drop a vertical line from where the radius line crosses the circumference like this (|\\ then you have another right angled triangle |\_\\ where D\^2 + V\^2=1. (D is the horizontal line and V is the vertical line). Now depending on the angle of the radius ,D < V, D= V or D>V or D=1 and V=0 or D=0 and V=1. So guess what? That D=0 and V=1 case describes the situation where you get the interference pattern, the D=1 and V=0 case describes the situation with the smudged intensity pattern and the other ones describe intermdeiate situations where there is partial interference and partial smuding which has also been observed in countless experiements. The quantum erasure sitaution corresponds to a half rotaion of the circle defined by that D, V inequality. The rotation is achieved using the optical elements in the quantum erasure interferometer set up.
&#x200B;
Also a quarter rotation of the circle corresponds to the interference pattern transitioning to the smudge intensity pattern. Now this shows that there is no collapse of the wavefunction. By adjusting the set up the probability distribution for location of the photon transitions to a different probability distribution for location. That smudged out pattern is actually two slightly overlapping Bell shaped distributions but its still a probabilty distribution which means there is no so called collapse. There is no observation either. Yes a particle is used to indicate where the photon was but this actually changes the probability distribution for where the particle is going end up. So while some information is gained about where the photon was it has no influence on where it will eventually be detected on the screen. The ""collapse of the wave function"" is an interpretation of what could be happening much like the many worlds, etc. But they are just interpretations. And do not represent what is predicted by quantum mechanics. Also while there is no ""collapse of the wave function"" there is a process that occurs when an excited state in a 2 level system interacts with the Environment often modelled as the infinite sum of harmonic field modes. The excited state will lose energy in the form of a photon to one of the Environment's field modes thereby decaying into the ground state. This may have been confused with wave function collapse. Pure states will also decohere to a mixed state over time meaning the off diagonal elements known as coherences will vanish leaving the density matrix in the form of a classical probability distribution. This may also have been misinterpreted as wave function collapse.
&#x200B;
Now the delayed choice quantum eraser. The entangled photons mean that there are now two of those circles (representing both photons) like I described in the last paragraph. So with one circle you have (D1, V1)=(0,1) which is the interference pattern and in the other circle you have (D2,V2)=(1,0) which is the smudged out pattern. So the entanglement means the 2 two type of patterrns (interference and smudged) are correlated and theres a particular probability for that correlation. And depending on the way you can adjust parameters in the optical set up using the different branches on the multiple interforemters in the experiment the (D1, V1)=(cos(theta1), sin(theta1)) and (D2, V2)=(cos(theta2), sin(theta2)) become correlated according to the relative angle (theta1-theta2) thereby showing that there is a range of probabilities for correlated interference patterns (including partial and full) to occur depending on which photons are detected.

Establishing causality with 100% certainty is almost impossible, so we default to terms like ""suggest"" to temper our claims. This doesn't mean that they just pulled something out of thin air -- the results of their data analysis are in line with their oroginal hypotheses and fit into the theory they outlined. \- Finally, they didn't force their data into a random theoretical framework. They provided a theoretical rationale for believing the brain--as a physical system--behaves in a certain way under certain conditions. They ran analyses to test this hypothesis and reported their results.

So saying this is the first time this has been observed just isn't true. Also, they only cooled it to an occupation of 2.6, which isn't quite down to absolute zero (really you want <1). But it is neat that you can sideband cool a mechanical system.";0;p0iie;[]

The challenge of storing quantum information is that quantum information is stored in spins. An electron can have two different spins, and the difference in energy between two spins is veeeery small, typically. This means that anything that provides more energy than that difference can alter the spin state. Room temperature thermal fluctuations are enough to alter the spin state, preventing a successful quantum application. Being able to store a spin state for 1.3 s is super impressive. What's also impressive is that they can do this with erbium, which is useful for telecommunications. If you wanted to send a quantum state from one place to another, the most common mechanism is to convert the state to a single photon and shoot it at your desired location. The problem with this is that most of the places you want to send quantum info aren't in eyesight, and it's hard to send light through solid things because they absorb. An alternative solution is to use a fiber, which can transport photons. However, fiber rely on bouncing a photon back and forth constantly to prevent it from escaping and direct it to the destination. During these bounces, if there is any imperfection, the single photon with your quantum state will be absorbed and lost. But, we can reliably transport photons about 20 miles. The trouble is, without any other technology, you'd only be able to pass quantum states 20 miles. A quantum repeater is one possible way to avoid this problem.
Imagine that every 20 miles, the photon was re-absorbed by one of these erbium crystals, and then launched again to preserve its quantum state. This would help you overcome the 20 mile limit and the ""eyesight"" restriction. ";0;6zmbnt;[]

This is because when an observer is present, the computer uses particles to render with maximum detail, but when the observer is not present the computer uses waves to conserve memory. If this is true, then we would also expect anti-matter to follow the same pattern because it is being rendered by the same computational process and limits. That is what this discovery means to me, anyway.
Edit: I say ""what this discovery means to me"" and want a discussion, yet all the replies are totally sure of themselves and more filled with insults than information.
Maybe the one piece of information in these replies is the idea the particle detector is the observer. But what does that mean really? It's a collision of a photon with atoms. An interaction of fields that can behave as waves when they're not colliding and particles when they are. And if that's wrong, I would love better information in a constructive way. Maybe this is a better way to articulate my thoughts about the experiment. I think it's showing that matter and anti matter are interactions of the same fields. Now, I imagine those fields as computational in how they interact. Conjecture? Sure. Impossible to prove? I doubt it.";0;bmc6mw;[]

In my mind, if you did this, you would have a well defined macro structure (close to the mean), but on closer inspection things would look fuzzier.

To get to the heart of the matter:
> The natural question is whether 'non-causal' quantum correlations of the kind described by our formalism can be found in nature. One can speculate that they may exist in unprobed physical regimes, such as, for example, those in which quantum mechanics and general relativity become relevant. Indeed, our result that classical theories can always be understood in terms of a global causal structure suggests the possibility that the observed causal order of space-time might not be a fundamental property of nature but rather emerge from a more fundamental theory.
So, they didn't *actually* find correlations that defied causality. They found a way with fancy maths to come up with *potential* correlations that would defy causality. Whether or not those correlations *actually exist* is unknown.

Such instances exist but only in super-world. The world that we know today does not support such conditions where the super-quantum laws of physics can exist. Physics is dependent on the matter and it's substance and there co-relation with the existing environment. For cause to be equally relevant with the effect at all times(past, present, future) it will have to exceed it's own existing self and will have to be in that state at all times. Surprisingly there is no such matter except soul. The sole reason behind it is that the matter should have the consciousness to enable it to be in super-Quanta state at all times to make effect and cause resembling at all times.

This is not a natural expectation for me, so I decided to look at [the actual paper]( instead of the press release. Surprisingly, the argument looks valid (though not sound) on a first glance. I'll summarize it for the benefit of others here:
1. Assume global causal order is not the case.
2. Assume standard quantum formalism only holds locally.
3. [insert complex math I skimmed through and assume is correct here]
4. The math is consistent with nonstandard global causes, such as described in the press release.
While this argument is by no means cogent due to sketchy premises, it is nevertheless an amazing finding in my opinion. I guess I just always assumed that the math *required* a global causal order, but this result shows that there is no contradiction from ""a causing b causing a"" scenarios.
Compare this to similarly famous discoveries showing that nothing inherently prevents time travel. It doesn't mean time travel (or alternate causal orders) must be possible, but it does open up the possibility given today's understanding of QM.";0;10vxar;[]

We know the truth about time, it's a dimension that we live in, and doesn't move. In the same way, cause and effect are part of the system we live in, and they seem to go together more often than not. We have plenty of empirical examples of non-causality, but we don't have any empirical examples of counter-causality, like this headline implies.

The next step is to figure out how to bring down the astronomical amount of energy needed to within the range of today's technologies, such as a large modern nuclear fission power plant. Then we can talk about building the first prototypes,"" says Lentz.
This paragraph would lead a lot of readers to the idea that the scale of energy required isn't so far away from what we can currently produce, whereas it's *a lot* further away from a current nuclear power plant than a cave man's fire is.
> Currently, the amount of energy required for this new type of space propulsion drive is still immense. Lentz explains, The energy required for this drive travelling at light speed encompassing a spacecraft of 100 meters in radius is on the order of hundreds of times of the mass of the planet Jupiter. The energy savings would need to be drastic, of approximately 30 orders of magnitude to be in range of modern nuclear fission reactors. He goes on to say: Fortunately, several energy-saving mechanisms have been proposed in earlier research that can potentially lower the energy required by nearly 60 orders of magnitude. Lentz is currently in the early-stages of determining if these methods can be modified, or if new mechanisms are needed to bring the energy required down to what is currently possible.
Since there's not a lot on what the energy saving methods are it's hard to judge what this work really means. However I wouldn't bother calling an engineer and asking for some energy just yet!";0;m1gyyi;[]

Perhaps to lift a ship from a planet without having huge engines?
Secondly, how about using the drive near a smaller mass, like another ship. Would the formation of the soliton destroy the close-by ship?
I also want to discuss what space would look like from inside the bubble, but I know someone asked this during the lecture and Lentz didn't have an answer. But maybe we could speculate?

What if a group of 3 particles are entangled, with Alice having 2 and Bob having 1.
At predetermined time intervals (eg every 0.1ms), Bob measures his entangled particle if he wishes to communicate a 1 in binary times. This will cause Alice's two entangled particles (in the same entanglement group) to take form of the same, opposite spin direction of Bob's particle.
Bob does not measure his entangled particle if he wishes to communicate a 0. This keeps all of the 3 entangled particles still in a superposition.
At every 0.1ms, Alice measures both of her entangled particles. If Bob has already measured the entangled particle, Alice will find that both of her entangled particles have the same spin. However, if Bob has not measured, then when Alice measures one of her entangled particles, the other entangled particle will find itself to the opposite spin state, and Alice will find her two entangled particles are different. This would mean that information would be passable.

Reading the [actual paper]( they start from the well-observed fact that times runs slower in a strong gravitational field than a weaker one. So if two clocks interacted, the one in the stronger gravitational field would be - is - seen as being slower. Your head runs a little bit faster than your feet when you are standing up. Denver runs ahead of Miami beach. Now, the arm wave. They imagine a gravitational mass that has quantum properties. This could exist in several locations, each of which would have differing effects on the two clocks. Alternatively, you have two masses that have differing probabilities of existing. (Yes, I know.) This would alter the relative time that the clocks tell in ways that would be ""quantum determined"". So time is indeterminate and with a yet greater arm wave, they adduce from this that so is causality. Modest problem is that the physical uncertainty of a massive body is utterly trivial.

I would like to dispel this misconception. Perhaps in this experiment it was just light bouncing off of electrons, it's not clear. But in general even if the light does not interact with the electrons, we can still make a measurement of their position. Consider a scenario where an electron can be in one of two places, and you shine light on the place where the electron isn't, and you find that there is no electron there, then you have measured the position of the electron, without interacting with it. The quantum zeno effect applies to this scenario as well. Consider a tunneling experiment, where an electron is on one side of a very high potential, and it quantum tunnels through this barrier. Suppose there is some typical time scale where the electron is expected to tunnel through the barrier, say 1 second. According to quantum theory, if we measure the side of the potential where the electron isn't, by firing photons into the empty space, the electrons tunneling will be suppressed. This can not be understood as the photons interacting with the electron, it is a uniquely quantum effect where having **information** about the position of the electron plays a role in its physical behaviour. Or to put it another way, it appears as though merely the **potential** for interaction influences the behaviour of a system. From a philosophical and metaphysical perspective this is in fact completely unprecedented, very hard to get your head around, and totally undermines traditionally acceped world views.;0;3pw7xy;[]
