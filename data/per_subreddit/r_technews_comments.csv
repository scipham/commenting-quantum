1,gf199dr,k8vzf3,1607413690.0,plsHelpmemes,r/technews,"Before anyone gets up in arms about ""ermahgerd my bank passwords"", keep in mind that most of the computational feats (especially large number factoring) done by quantum computing are mostly stunts without practical applications to cryptography. These look impressive but are mostly mathematical clickbait. [This stack overflow post describes it well.](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/59795/largest-integer-factored-by-shors-algorithm) For all practical matters, the largest number ever factored by a quantum computer using Shor's algorithm is still only 35, and that was a year ago.

When I took a Quantum Computing class in University, I remember my professor specifically shits hard on D-Wave, as they peddle their achievements in number of cubits (something like 2000+) in their quantum computer. In reality, their cubits are ""low quality"" and basically useless. Most serious research efforts into Quantum by IBM/Google/Government use 100 cubits on the very high end. For reference, there is a [study done](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09749v2) that estimates the need for ~20million cubits to beat 2048 bit RSA.",0,k8vzf3,[]

Quantum computer is a type of an ""analog computer"". I.e.

1) There is a distinct physical process
2) There is a distinct heavy computation of interest that directly resembles the physical process in question
3) Instead of doing #2, we let #1 happen and check out results

This kind of thing existed years ago. What is new today is the specific physical processes that are being harnessed are from the quantum world.

That is it.


Note that:

1) It is not a generic computing device and it will never become one
2) Speed up in ""calculations"" is inherently tied to physical process being described by the same equations one is trying to solve
3) And a bummer is that the calculation result might or might not be correct. Probability of it being correct might be increased by adding more steps.",0,wnqygj,[]

It sort of makes sense to me since so many quantum algorithms depend on interference in a frequency domain, so, like the way sunflower seeds pack best because there are no biased spiral patterns, in some sense fibonacci (and hence the golden ratio) never biases something that is supposed to find cyclical patterns.

A tardigrade has been quantum entangled with a superconducting qubit – and lived to tell the tale. It is the first time a multicellular organism has been placed in this strange quantum state and raises questions about what it means for living things to be entangled.
Tardigrades are microscopic animals that can survive extreme temperatures and pressures in a hibernating state called a tun. Rainer Dumke and his colleagues at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, placed one of these hibernating tardigrades on a superconducting qubit, an element of a quantum computer.
They then lowered the pressure and temperature to almost a perfect vacuum and near absolute zero, reducing any outside influence, or excitations, on the qubit and tardigrade.
“Because all the excitations are frozen out, you can actually describe [the system] in terms of physics, there’s no need to describe it in terms of biology,” says Dumke.
When researchers measured the natural frequency at which the tardigrade and qubit combination vibrates, the result only made sense if the two objects were in a state of quantum entanglement, meaning that their quantum properties were linked.
After they had finished making measurements, the researchers slowly depressurised and warmed up the tardigrade, bringing it out of its tun state and back to life.
The temperature involved, just 0.01°C above absolute zero, is the lowest a tardigrade has ever survived. The fact that the creatures can tolerate such extreme conditions suggests their hardiness is a result of completely shutting off their metabolic processes.
“There was still some discussion that perhaps there is a little bit of metabolism that actually goes on [in the tun tardigrade],” says team member Tomasz Paterek at the University of Gdańsk, Poland. “But this experiment shows – because it’s so cold, and for such a long time – that it’s really ametabolic. There is no chemistry going on in this piece of stuff.”
“The fact you can maintain a quantum state, which has quantum coherence in it and involves the degrees of freedom of a biological system as large as a tardigrade, is very exciting,” says Chiara Marletto at the University of Oxford, who entangled a bacterium with light in 2018.
While the tardigrade was certainly living before and after the entanglement, one point of contention is whether it was alive during the entanglement, and exactly how it was entangled.
“You never know in this kind of experiment what exactly is the part of [the tardigrade] that takes part in the entanglement,’ says Paterek.
The tardigrade was actually the third to undergo the entanglement experiment, as the first two didn’t survive the process as a result of being warmed up too quickly. Despite these technical hurdles, Dumke and his team hope to entangle other forms of life in future.
While technically challenging and not involving live organisms, researchers have entangled photons at room temperature, as well as 3-millimetre-wide diamonds.
But the tardigrade entanglement is an important first step to going further. “It is really in the best tradition of theoretical experimental physics, where you’re being playful, but at the same time, you’re trying to understand and answer deep questions,” says Marletto. “That’s inherently risky, but very rewarding if it works out well. We need more of this stuff.”",0,rjayn9,[]

Like for instance I was at work yesterday and they were talking about how lumber is going through the roof, I didn’t say it but I was thinking I don’t know how that’s possible when lumber is a 100% renewable resource. 

We can literally grow trees.

We’ve been being subtly tricked by the way they report and speak on things. 

Sure they make items, like chips and motherboards and processors.

But those things come from elements found in nature:

Like for instance “lithium” 

I don’t think the chip shortage is because of “supply chain” that’s a lie I think, I think it’s because Africa is slowly becoming more and more independent abd they are taking their resources, which led to china trying to push their way in, which didn’t work too well, then all of a sudden, all of these ways to get people into buying gpus became a thing….crypto and nfts.

Now we see countries trying to establish their own infrastructure specifically for creating more chips.

941,i5c15hv,u6w5xr,1650371111.0,SquareConfusion,r/technews,"“The research, conducted in collaboration with scientists at Harvard University in the US, Macquarie University in Australia and Aarhus University in Denmark and published in Nature Materials, used a naturally mined cuprous oxide (Cu2O) gemstone from Namibia to produce Rydberg polaritons, the largest hybrid particles of light and matter ever created.

Rydberg polaritons switch continually from light to matter and back again. In Rydberg polaritons, light and matter are like two sides of a coin, and the matter side is what makes polaritons interact with each other.

This interaction is crucial because this is what allows the creation of quantum simulators, a special type of quantum computer, where information is stored in quantum bits. These quantum bits, unlike the binary bits in classical computers that can only be 0 or 1, can take any value between 0 and 1. They can therefore store much more information and perform several processes simultaneously.

This capability could allow quantum simulators to solve important mysteries of physics, chemistry and biology, for example, how to make high-temperature superconductors for highspeed trains, how cheaper fertilizers could be made potentially solving global hunger, or how proteins fold making it easier to produce more effective drugs.”",0,u6w5xr,[]

Preliminary definition: An exciton is a type of ""particle"" that can form on a crystal with certain properties. It's basically an electron and an electron hole (i.e. a place an electron should be but isn't, usually because it gained energy somehow and moved out of the valence band) that are attracted to one another, since they have opposite charge. This allows a material to transport energy in the form of the motion of the exciton, without transporting any charge, since the electron is negatively charged and the electron hole is positively charged, so they're electric dipoles that are overall neutral much like a hydrogen atom.

The experiment used a cavity resonator, which is basically a specially shaped container that bounces photons back and forth in it. It has what's called a resonant frequency, which means that only photons of particular frequencies are able to bounce back and forth inside it. They did this to make sure they're only using photons of a particular wavelength.

The crystal (the one imported from Namibia) they used has a particularly high Rydberg constant, which is a rare property in most materials. Because it has such a high Rydberg constant, it admits excitons of correspondingly high energies with reasonably high lifetimes (around 300 ps). Higher-energy excitons react more strongly to photons (i.e. they're strongly coupled). The final state that they were trying to produce were Rydberg exciton-polaritons, which are just excitons that are strongly coupled to photons.

So they put the crystal into their resonator and tuned their light to create excitons in the crystal. The excitons were able to couple strongly to the photons, and they were able to produce Rydberg polaritons of larger sizes and higher energies than previously seen.",0,u6w5xr,[]

The main takeaway is that the cooling part of a quantum computer, which comprises the most of the building blocks and is an obstacle to mass production, can be possible be left out.

Takeaway:
Pros: possible quantum computers at room temperature, possible more states / redundancy in a single qubit for input. 
Possible a way towards error-free qubits with a magnitude less error-prone qubits for input. 

No cooling means it could theoretically be even better than classical computers for some low energy computations. 

Cons: none stated i could identify but there are probably some, otherwise this would alteady be a thing. Cons like „Measurement of qubits are hard“ or „Applying Pauli-Matrices is still in development“ or „state decay is more rapid than with other quantum computer variants“. Something along those lines. 


The article also said that they just started doing it and they hired this PhD Xi to help them. 
IMO they have an idea what it should be like and are now trying to build it. Still nothing which is usable. Maybe will be in some years with exactly what was written here.

“What the neutron does is come in with a particular energy and momentum, and it can flip the Cooper pair spins from an up-up state to an up-down state,” Dai said. “It tells you how the pairs are formed. From this neutron spin resonance, one can basically determine the electron pairing energy” and other telltale properties of the quantum mechanical wave function that describes the pair, he said.

Dai said there are two possible explanations for the result: either uranium ditelluride is not a spin-triplet superconductor, or spin-triplet superconductivity arises from antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in a way that physicists haven’t previously imagined. Dai said decades of experimental evidence points to the latter, but this appears to violate conventional wisdom about superconductivity.

“Spin-triplet pairing states are highly improbable in the vast majority of cases because pairs will form as spin-singlets in order to lower their energy,” Si said. “In uranium ditelluride, spin-orbit coupling can change the energy landscape in a way that makes spin-triplet pairing states more competitive with their spin-singlet counterparts.”

In the case of the ""quantum time flip"", the researchers used a special optical crystal to split a photon, or packet of light, into two paths. One path traveled through the crystal, while the other path did not. The researchers found that the path of the photon through the crystal exhibited a temporal behavior known as ""time reversal,"" in which the photon appeared to travel backward in time.

This effect is not the same as true time travel, as it does not involve the actual reversal of the flow of time. Instead, it is a quantum phenomenon that arises due to the way that the quantum system is prepared and measured.

1743,j0evsp2,zloibj,1671160563.0,wolfford,r/technews,"It is possible to manipulate the time evolution of a quantum system in certain circumstances. One way to do this is through the use of a quantum time evolution operator, which describes how a quantum system changes over time.

In the case of the ""quantum time flip"", the researchers used a special optical crystal to split a photon, or packet of light, into two paths. One path traveled through the crystal, while the other path did not. The researchers found that the path of the photon through the crystal exhibited a temporal behavior known as ""time reversal,"" in which the photon appeared to travel backward in time.

This effect is not the same as true time travel, as it does not involve the actual reversal of the flow of time. Instead, it is a quantum phenomenon that arises due to the way that the quantum system is prepared and measured.

It is important to note that this type of quantum time manipulation is still a subject of active research and is not fully understood. Further study is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and potential applications of these phenomena.",0,zloibj,[]

We want a quantum computer to run a program across multiple ""SIMD Regions"" over multiple cycles -- in this model, each region runs zero or one operations per cycle, and can only hold the data it is working with.

Quantum computers store and work with information in ""qubits"".  It is not possible to copy qubits; moving a qubit is called quantum teleportation.  While quantum teleportation is a normal and common part of a quantum computer, each move adds noise to the results, so we want to do it less.

The prior approach to managing a qubit is that at the start of every cycle:

* If a region needs it, move it there
* Else if its region is idle (i.e. has no operation), leave it in place 
* Else move it to global memory
 
The patent approach is:

* If a region needs it, move it there
* **Else if another region is idle, and will use the qubit when it stops being idle, move it there**
* Else if its region is idle, leave it in place 
* Else move it to global memory

So this allows for a direct copy in more cases, saving one move each time.",0,pghepu,[]

1941,fz5d6u2,hx77f6,1595636639.0,Haxxardoux,r/technews,"Seems that most of the comments here are “nothing is unhackable”. That is true about software at a high level, but “quantum” communications are not built on traditional software - they are able to exploit a form of information transfer that is not based on the classical computing paradigm of binary information, so the same high level software principles do not apply. 

To use a quantum computer to communicate, you create a system of (usually two) connected (entangled) sub-atomic particles. I think most places use hydrogen atoms. The “information” is encoded in the electron of the hydrogen atom, which can have two possible states, and can be in  either state simultaneously until it is measured. Once you take the measurement, the “combined” state collapses into one of the two possible states. When you measure one, it collapses both states. You can therefore alter the state of one, and have your partner measure the other to transmit information. If someone tries to intercept the message, your partner will see that the stare has already been measured when he receives it. This will alert both parties that someone is spying. This is one of two ways the system is “unhackable” 

The other way is due to the fact that the system itself is comprised of entangled hydrogen atoms. Since you can transfer information in this “quantum” way, the entire system can be classically analog. Most of our missiles are analog so they can’t be hacked remotely. This would make the system “unhackable” in the sense that it cannot be done remotely, which is probably perfectly sufficient for the DOD

Edit: The reason I say “useless” is because of decoherence. Quantum computers are more likely to mess up a computation because qubits are more fragile than classical bits. To do any large scale computation with a quantum computer, you need it to be fault-tolerant. Fault-tolerance requires encoding your qubits into many qubits with quantum error correcting codes. We then will need millions of qubits to do this, along with better control over them than we have now.  

If I put my money any company investing in this technology, it would not be D-wave, IBM, or google. I think Psi-Quantum has the best chance of doing something sooner. They have the “go big or go home” approach, focusing all their efforts on making fault-tolerant qubits. Unfortunately, they are pretty secretive about their progress.

Also, I am not appealing to the fallacy that abstract math has no purpose if we don’t immediately see its value. In fact, I think everyone in this thread should learn as much as they can about quantum computing. Go and download Nielsen and Chuang or watch some lectures on YouTube.

2267,h1lqcba,ny3z76,1623573676.0,Chamberlyne,r/technews,"To people complaining that this “unhackable” system is in fact hackable: it actually is unhackable.

Quantum Key Distribution, QKD, is mathematically proven to be indecipherable. This is *without* making any assumptions on Eve (the attacking eavesdropper), but only a few on Alice and Bob (sender and receiver).

What QKD does is use qubits to create a one-time key to a cypher. This key is created using quantum mechanics (perfectly random) and privacy amplification (shortening the random key using classical cyphers) to create something that cannot be duplicated except by random chance. Once you have your key, you can use that to create a message which is indecipherable.

What that means is that the only way for someone to control what is being sent or received has to physically take over the material sending and receiving the qubits. 

Why is that? Why is the only way to beat QKD is to physically take over both the sender and receiver? Because of QBER.

QBER is the Quantum Bit Error Rate. It is a number which is more or less unique to each QKD communication line. This is a gross simplification, but it can be understood as the % of times a qubit being sent is “modified” by the environment. 

If you have Eve trying to find out what Alice is sending to Bob, she will have to measure the qubits and will end up changing their state. This increases the QBER, which can be detected by both Alice and Bob, and means that they can stop exchanging the key and figure out what is happening.

Since no actual message has been sent, only a key, even if Eve gets any parts of that key, she doesn’t actually gain any information since there was no message. Alice and Bob can keep on making new keys until the QBER is at a number which tells them there are no opponents listening in. 

This method is perfectly unhackable.",0,ny3z76,[]

They market it like an actual OLED panel and price it like one too, but it just doesn’t compare. They came out when LG was selling OLED and Sony had one on the way or just released. It’s been a few years and Samsung is still sticking to an inferior product. What am I missing here?

Edit: LG owns the rights. Makes sense. Samsung better figure something out because QLED just isn’t good enough compared to OLED.",0,e2yyzg,[]
