Are you suffering from a severely polarized society and a fast-growing population living below the poverty line? Well, I have the laser to solve all your problems.
OK, maybe not. But when it comes to quantum computing, I believe that lasers are the future. I suspect that the current architectures are akin to the Colossus or the ENIAC: they are breakthroughs in their own right, but they are not the future. My admittedly biased opinion is that the future is optical. A new paper provides my opinion some support, demonstrating solutions to a mind-boggling 1030 problem space using a quantum optical system. Unfortunately, the support is a little more limited than I'd like, as it is a rather limited breakthrough.
Photons flipping coins
The researchers have demonstrated something called a Gaussian boson sampling system. This is essentially a device designed to solve a single type of problem. It's based on devices called ""beam splitters,"" so let's start with a closer look at how those work.
If you shine light on a mirror that is 50 percent reflective, called a beam splitter, then half the light will be transmitted and half reflected. If the light intensity is low enough that only a single photon is present, it is either reflected or transmitted with the same randomness as a fair coin toss. This is the idea behind a beam splitter, which can take an incoming stream of photons from a laser beam and divide it into two beams traveling in different directions.
A beam splitter at 45 degrees can be thought of as a four-port device (see picture). In that picture, you can see that if two identical photons are incident on the same beam splitter from two different ports, then the result is not entirely random. They will both exit the same port, though which port they exit is random.
These two simple ideas, along with the idea of entanglement, result in a specific type of universal quantum computer, called a linear optical quantum computer. It's basically a big network of beam splitters. Photons solve a problem by the way they spread through the network, which is determined based on where they exit.
Entanglement comes in the form of the path taken by the photons. Until and unless we measure that path, we cannot know its details, so we have to consider that all photons take all possible paths. Under these circumstances, if two photons arrive at a beam splitter at the same time via different ports, then their paths will become linked (entangled). Build a big-enough network of beam splitters and this can happen many times, creating sprawling entangled states.
Flipping entangled photonic coins
The number of output states scales very quickly with the number of inputs and beam splitters. In the current demonstration, the researchers used 50 inputs and—the exact type of device is not described—a chip with the equivalent of 300 beam splitters. The total number of possible output states is about 1030, which is about 14 orders of magnitude greater than the next biggest demonstration of quantum computing.
Photons are sent into the network (one at each input) and exit in a state that is randomly chosen from all possible states. In less than four minutes, the researchers had obtained results that they estimate would take a fast classical computer about 2.5 billion years to calculate.
This was followed by careful tests to check that the behavior was indeed quantum. Now, of course, computing the exact output for a full input is impossible. But it is possible to calculate what would happen given specific input states and compare the output states with the results of those calculation. It is also possible to calculate the output of the network if the light is not in a quantum state or if the photons are not identical. In the first case, the measurement results match the predictions, and in the second two cases, the measurement results don’t match the predictions. This provides strong evidence for the result being due to quantum effects.
Flipping useless
In many respects, this is a fantastic result. I don’t think anyone can very easily argue that the researchers have not demonstrated a quantum speed-up. It is also an incredible engineering achievement. One laser provides 25 equal-intensity beams, each carefully aligned to two crystals that each generate single photons. These are then carefully aligned to optical fibers, the outputs of which have to be carefully coupled to the chip that houses the beam splitters. The outputs need to be carefully aligned to photodetectors. The whole setup, which probably occupies an area of about 1.5m x 2.5m, has to be carefully stabilized to high precision (about 10nm). No doubt there are several super-proud PhD students who did all of that painstaking work.
On the other hand, the work is no different to other quantum-advantage experiments: take a problem that is mostly useless but happens to map exactly to the architecture of your computer. Naturally, the computer can solve it. But the point of a computer—and this is why the researchers do not refer to the device as a computer—is to solve many different useful problems. And for these cases, we have not yet seen undisputed evidence of the promised quantum advantage. I have no doubt that it will come, though.
Light is enlightening
Even though this work is not as overwhelmingly positive as it first seems, I still think optical quantum computers are the way to go.
At the moment, practical quantum computers come in only two flavors. The licorice-flavored variety consists of a string of ions (an atom with an electron removed) that are all lined up like a string of pearls. The ions are far enough apart that they can be separately addressed, which means that information (in the form of quantum bits, called qubits) can be stored and read from individual atoms. Computation operations can be performed using microwaves and by using the motion of the ions. Here, each bit is highly reliable, but performing complex computation is a rather difficult and stately dance of microwave pulses and laser pulses.
The lemon sherbet of quantum computers are the liquid-helium-cooled superconducting rings. Each ring represents a qubit, which are addressed and coupled to each other via wires. The advantage of this approach is that the hardware is relatively easy to scale—it’s basically the same skill as making printed circuit boards. But the quantum behavior of each qubit is much easier to disrupt, so your board is unlikely to work. You compensate for the reliability problem by repeating the computation many times and looking for the most common answer.
Neither option is particularly attractive in any context other than quantum computing as a service.
Size and temperature
Unlike both of these options, an optical quantum computer could be a (large) chip-scale device that is powered by an array of laser diodes, with readout done by a series of single-photon detectors. None of these require ultralow temperatures or vacuum (if photon-counting detectors are required, liquid nitrogen would be required). Optical quantum computing will require temperature stability and, as this paper demonstrates, a rather complicated feedback system to ensure that the lasers are working exactly as required. However, all of that could be contained in one large rack-mounted box. And that is, for me, the critical advantage of optical systems.
This does not mean that light will win, though.

Experts say technology is getting closer to commercialization
It's not what you'd expect to find on the 29th floor of a Toronto office building. Instead of cubicles, a complex arrangement of lasers, mirrors and optical fibres run from floor to ceiling, making up the quantum computer called Borealis.
And Borealis recently hit a milestone by solving a colossal math problem.
""If we ran [the problem] on the most powerful supercomputer out there, it would take 9,000 years. For Borealis, it takes less than a second, which is quite incredible,"" says Christian Weedbrook, CEO of Xanadu, the company that built Borealis.
Weedbrook said it's just the third time a quantum computer has tackled something out of reach for an ordinary computer, a scenario called quantum advantage. The first time was by Google in 2019, the second by a team of Chinese researchers in 2020. Xanadu's achievement was published earlier this summer in the magazine Nature.
For years, quantum computers have mostly been the focus of academics and government. Now, experts say we could be near a turning point where the technology is closer to commercialization.
""It's a really nice step showing that the technology is mature … and could be a candidate for more wide-scale adoption of quantum computers,"" said Anne Broadbent, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa where she researches quantum computing.
Weedbrook said the potential for quantum computers is almost limitless, opening the door to ""solving important business problems in industries from finance to drug discovery and material design.""
Exponential possibilities
The concepts used in quantum computing may seem mind-bending, and they're very powerful. Ordinary computers encode information using zeros and ones, called binary digits — or bits for short. Using quantum physics, these supercomputers can use zeros, ones, or any value in between, in something known as quantum digits — or qubits. This allows them to perform calculations much faster on problems that are more complex.
But the big difference between the two types of computers is how they actually approach a problem. If a regular computer were to try to get through a maze, it would consider each possible route one at a time. A quantum computer would consider all the routes at once.
""Just adding one [qubit] doubles the computational capacity of your system,"" says Stephanie Simmons, an associate professor of physics at Simon Fraser University and a founder of Vancouver-based quantum startup Photonic. ""It's exponential … so the scale is off the charts and that's the kind of power that we're hoping to leverage.""
In July, Simmons and her team also had an innovation published in Nature: a silicon chip that holds 150,000 qubits. Since silicon is already so widely used in technology, Simmons says it will be easier to produce these beefier chips on a larger scale.
""What we see next is the commercialization of quantum, and so we'll start to see little glimmers and then all of a sudden it's going to change everything we do.""
The global picture
The race is on to build a universal quantum computer that can solve a wide array of problems. Startups in the sector are booming, with 23 quantum businesses based in Canada, according to McKinsey & Co., a global management consultant. The U.S. is the only country further ahead, sitting at 59 quantum-related startups.
Weedbrook said the growth in this field offers an opportunity to attract scientific talent to the country.
""Xanadu is kind of doing … a brain gain of sorts,"" he said. ""We have over half the people that started it are actually from overseas.""
WATCH | Commercialization the next step for quantum computers:
American corporate heavyweights like IBM, Google and Microsoft are making a big commercial push, as are Amazon and Honeywell. And governments are increasingly making quantum computing a priority. The U.S. just signed the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides about $280 billion US for quantum, computing and artificial intelligence research and development. Meanwhile, China and the EU are also investing heavily in this technology.
""We're looking at a scenario where there's international competition that is very strong,"" said Broadbent, the Ottawa professor. ""Canada has been traditionally ahead in many areas … we want to keep that effort going.""
Canada committed $360 million in the 2021 federal budget towards building a national quantum strategy. Simmons said she hopes that with continued investment ""we could really make a big difference in terms of keeping the jobs here, keeping the talent here and actually benefiting from this economic windfall.""
Getting practical
While quantum computers are still in their nascent stage, experts already point to them as having the potential to solve complex problems like climate change and cybersecurity. The technology is beginning to creep into business plans too, with Goldman Sachs using quantum computers to improve calculations in options financing and Volkswagen looking to use them to optimize its manufacturing.
Prof. Daniel Gottesman, a theoretical computer scientist at the University of Maryland, acknowledges there is still plenty of hype in the industry.
""There's a lot of reason to hope for the future of quantum computing, but there's also uncertainty as well … progress could slow down,"" he said.
Still he predicts quantum computers will live up to expectations; it's just a matter of when. ""It will be some time before we get ones that are big enough to do things that are useful for anything — and even longer before we get ones that are useful for lots of things.""
The technology does face hurdles, including cost and the scale of production, but Simmons expects quantum computing to make a big difference.
""Even if you don't use quantum computers at your desk, you're still going to live the effects. Because lots of firms are going to be able to use this exponential boost in computing power to change what they can deliver to us as consumers.""",6065,"['ik79nbi', 'ik6yrky', 'ik7d2r8', 'ik7hw49', 'ik7dtmb', 'ik790ap', 'ik7itk6', 'ik7eks1', 'ik71hhk', 'ik79m9b', 'ik7cscs', 'ik6z649', 'ik7ntaa', 'ik87vgf', 'ik8s4db', 'ik8sz9l', 'ik8xgkc', 'ik965b3', 'ik9c9jf', 'ik9ks3v', 'ik7e1o5', 'ik7p395', 'ik7jhqa', 'ik73s15', 'ik7k221', 'ik7n612', 'ik7n7j9', 'ik7rcwi', 'ik7rxxl', 'ik7sm8u', 'ik7t2lk', 'ik7u0ao', 'ik7umac', 'ik7x3ng', 'ik7yp5r', 'ik7zc5g', 'ik80eqt', 'ik83u4d', 'ik85jg3', 'ik87y0b', 'ik8aoc2', 'ik8chnl', 'ik8f2j2', 'ik8jde6', 'ik8ml04', 'ik8p0ah', 'ik8roi1', 'ik8t5qr', 'ik96ozr', 'ik993yp', 'ik99u68', 'ik9nx5j', 'ik9p3ki', 'ik9y0kn', 'ika0lti', 'ika1unw', 'ika43rm', 'ika7x05', 'ikamnyq', 'ikap18h', 'ikb2yhd', 'ikbelz0', 'ikbw5wp', 'ik74xy4', 'ik8cqc9']"

The milestone, known as quantum supremacy, comes just over a year after Google became the first in the world to achieve the same feat.
The team from the University of Science and Technology of China built a quantum computer capable of performing computations nearly 100 trillion times faster than the world’s most powerful supercomputer, according to a research paper published in the journal Science.
China’s leading quantum computing researchers revealed that their next-generation machine used a completely different set up compared to Google, proving that there are multiple approaches to this nascent technology.
The researchers claimed their prototype was 10 billion times faster than Google’s machine, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Quantum computers were first theorised nearly 40 years ago by the physicist Richard Feynman, but practical machines are only now beginning to be realised.
They work by replacing traditional bits – the ‘1’s’ and ‘0’s’ used to encode digital information – with quantum bits, or qubits. These are able to function as both a ‘1’ and a ‘0’ at the same time by existing in a state of superposition, meaning each new qubit added to the computer increases is power exponentially rather than linearly.
The emergence of quantum computers holds the promise of making information processing exponentially more powerful in order to transform everything from disease treatment, to eliminating traffic.
However security experts have also warned that the unfathomably fast computers pose a major threat to modern forms of encryption that systems of finance, communication and government currently rely upon.
This could ultimately pose a threat to national security, with the United States already warning that advances in China could see the US fall behind in the technological arms race.

Amazon is also in the mix. The company the AWS Center for Quantum Computing last year and has via Amazon Web Services since 2019. It's expanding that work to what it says is an essential aspect of helping quantum tech reach its full potential: quantum networking. As such, the company has the AWS Center for Quantum Networking (CQN).
As with quantum computing, it's early days for quantum networking. It will likely before researchers start getting the most out of quantum tech. However, Amazon has more resources than most to invest in the field.
Amazon notes that quantum networks will be able to connect quantum devices using single photons rather than laser beams (which are utilized in modern optical communications). However, along with enabling certain capabilities of quantum networks, there are some hurdles to overcome when it comes to using a single photon. Quantum mechanics limits the amplification of a single photon, which restricts the range of a network. ""Also, the weakness of single photons complicates interfacing them with today’s quantum computing devices,"" CQN research scientists Denis Sukachev and Mihir Bhaskar wrote in a blog post.
Researchers at the center will work on new technologies, such as quantum repeaters and transducers, to allow for the creation of global quantum networks. They'll develop hardware, software and apps for quantum networks.
Among the potential applications of quantum networking is ""enabling global communications protected by quantum key distribution with privacy and security levels not achievable using conventional encryption techniques,"" Sukachev and Bhaskar wrote.

The matter phase relies on a quirk of the Fibonacci sequence to remain in a quantum state for longer.
Just as ordinary matter can be in a solid, liquid, gas, or superheated plasmic phase (or state), quantum materials also have phases. The phase refers to how the matter is structured on an atomic level—the arrangement of its atoms or its electrons, for example. Several years ago, physicists discovered a quantum supersolid, and last year, a team confirmed the existence of quantum spin liquids, a long-suspected phase of quantum matter, in a simulator. The recent team thinks they’ve discovered another new phase.
Quantum bits, or qubits, are like ordinary computer bits in that their values can be 0 or 1, but they can also be 0 or 1 simultaneously, a state of ambiguity that allows the computers to consider many possible solutions to a problem much faster than an ordinary computer. Quantum computers should eventually be able to solve problems that classical computers can’t.
Qubits are often atoms; in the recent case, the researchers used 10 ytterbium ions, which were controlled by electric fields and manipulated using laser pulses. When multiple qubits’ states can be described in relation to one another, the qubits are considered entangled. Quantum entanglement is a delicate agreement between multiple qubits in a system, and the agreement is dissolved the moment any one of those bits’ values is certain. At that moment, the system decoheres, and the quantum operation falls apart.
A big challenge of quantum computing is maintaining the quantum state of qubits. The slightest fluctuations in temperature, vibrations, or electromagnetic fields can cause the supersensitive qubits to decohere and their calculations to fall apart. Since the longer the qubits stay quantum, the more you can get done, making computers’ quantum states persist for as long as possible is a crucial step for the field.
In the recent research, pulsing a laser periodically at the 10 ytterbium qubits kept them in a quantum state—meaning entangled—for 1.5 seconds. But when the researchers pulsed the lasers in the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence, they found that the qubits on the edge of the system remained in a quantum state for about 5.5 seconds, the entire length of the experiment (the qubits could have remained in a quantum state for longer, but the team ended the experiment at the 5.5-second mark). Their research was published this summer in Nature.
You can think of the Fibonacci sequence laser pulses as two frequencies that never overlap. That makes the pulses a quasicrystal: a pattern that has order, but no periodicity.
“The key result in my mind was showing the difference between these two different ways to engineer these quantum states and how one was better at protecting it from errors than the other,” said study co-author Justin Bohnet, a quantum engineer at Quantinuum, the company whose computer was used in the recent experiment.
The Fibonacci sequence is a numeric pattern in which each number is the sum of the two previous numbers (so 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). Its history goes back over 2,000 years and is connected to the so-called golden ratio. Now, the unique series may have quantum implications.
“It turns out that if you engineer laser pulses in the correct way, your quantum system can have symmetries that come from time translation,” said Philipp Dumitrescu, the paper’s lead author and a quantum physicist who conducted the work while at the Flatiron Institute. A time-translation symmetry means that an experiment will yield the same result, regardless of whether it takes place today, tomorrow, or 100 years from now.
“What we realized is that by using quasi-periodic sequences based on the Fibonacci pattern, you can have the system behave as if there are two distinct directions of time,” Dumitrescu added.
Shooting the qubits with laser pulses with a periodic (a simple A-B-A-B) pattern didn’t prolong the system’s quantum state. But by pulsing the laser in a Fibonacci sequence (A-AB-ABA-ABAAB, and so on), the researchers gave the qubits a non-repeating, or quasi-periodic, pattern.
It’s similar to the quasicrystals from the Trinity nuclear test site, but instead of being a three-dimensional quasicrystal, the physicists made a quasicrystal in time. In both cases, symmetries that exist at higher dimensions can be projected in a lower dimension, like the tessellated patterns in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling.
“With this quasi-periodic sequence, there’s a complicated evolution that cancels out all the errors that live on the edge,” Dumitrescu said in a Simons Foundation release. By on the edge, he’s referring to the qubits farthest from the center of their configuration at any one time. “Because of that, the edge stays quantum-mechanically coherent much, much longer than you’d expect.” The Fibonacci-pattern laser pulses made the edge qubits more robust.
More robust, longer-lived quantum systems are a vital need for the future of quantum computing. If it takes shooting qubits with a very specific mathematical rhythm of laser pulses to keep a quantum computer in an entangled state, then physicists had better start blasting.",5357,"['it2470i', 'it2gitd', 'it28o2i', 'it2axnw', 'it2a0tg', 'it2cp70', 'it2fl5t', 'it298py', 'it359xp', 'it4s7nb', 'it4r4nb', 'it2f6gv', 'it2cpmr', 'it2gmax', 'it2td7a', 'it2xzio', 'it2yyj1', 'it34aej', 'it35ibb', 'it38gah', 'it3ns25', 'it4wg5b', 'it54ocz', 'it28wys', 'it2fgt0', 'it2pf2a', 'it2pfa3', 'it2pqvt', 'it2ql0x', 'it315gk', 'it34h4w', 'it35uwp', 'it3821m', 'it3ewmf', 'it3fq5p', 'it3hqur', 'it3j4a5', 'it3k049', 'it3l51g', 'it3mwuh', 'it3o5ym', 'it3pb5s', 'it3r6o6', 'it3t0kp', 'it3tnvh', 'it3tvhy', 'it3v4ut', 'it3v9dp', 'it4e18g', 'it4nuzg', 'it5juhx', 'it5rms3', 'it5u5vv', 'it5ulvi', 'it5un6q', 'it5vxce', 'it61nzw', 'it8sxba', 'it2k8qi', 'it2n9m1', 'it2yp85', 'it2zqvt', 'it503k8', 'it5s8gk', 'it60bju', 'it2jfif', 'it2kuv2', 'it2mz0m', 'it2o4cl', 'it2ocar', 'it2p9mi', 'it2ry28', 'it2s5ox', 'it2srle', 'it2su5i', 'it2tm34', 'it2u684', 'it2u76y', 'it2w838', 'it2wif5', 'it2x121', 'it2xxvm', 'it39s33', 'it39uzl', 'it3a2b9', 'it3b23t', 'it3f3rm', 'it3fc6v', 'it3h8b7', 'it3i4sk', 'it3ibcm', 'it3idz5', 'it3oltr', 'it3pctk', 'it3qddq', 'it3rr76', 'it3td6c', 'it3vxtz', 'it3xagb', 'it3xne0', 'it3xr0r', 'it3yut4', 'it41feh', 'it41mw9', 'it42kw9', 'it42sxx', 'it435vm', 'it43ic6', 'it43mnp', 'it43t99', 'it44hoo', 'it44sgq', 'it45vl8', 'it47fy6', 'it4dpy0', 'it4dtn2', 'it4dxh0', 'it4fard', 'it4gkss', 'it4jb2g', 'it4l096', 'it4l2hc', 'it4l4yz', 'it4ni1z', 'it4oggd', 'it4pyhj', 'it4q54a', 'it4sbbk', 'it4vqwq', 'it4w3dm', 'it510w5', 'it54hsj', 'it557n6', 'it56h4n', 'it5gfou', 'it5gggb', 'it5v1b3', 'it5zkic', 'it6491q', 'it71qk0', 'it724ye', 'it75joi', 'it7bwcw', 'it7lnc3', 'it7ucc1', 'it80frv', 'it85dly', 'it86t2t', 'it8fq2a', 'it8izfj', 'it8rw8l', 'ithwic1', 'it46o7c', 'it69aed']"

Cleveland Clinic and IBM said this month that deployment work of the first private sector onsite, IBM-managed quantum computer in the United States.
“The current pace of scientific discovery is unacceptably slow, while our research needs are growing exponentially,” said Lara Jehi, M.D., Cleveland Clinic’s Chief Research Information Officer. “We cannot afford to continue to spend a decade or more going from a research idea in a lab to therapies on the market. Quantum offers a future to transform this pace, particularly in drug discovery and machine learning.”
First announced in 2019, the System One is enclosed in a nine-foot sealed cube, made of half-inch thick borosilicate glass. IBM has previously told DCD that the system installed will be the ‘latest generation of the device’ with between 50-100 qubits, but didn’t share power requirements for the system.
The healthcare provider has a 3MW, 263,000 sq ft data center in Brecksville, to the south of the city, but this will not be where the new System One will live but on a ""secured site on Cleveland Clinic’s main campus in Cleveland,” the company told us.
Cleveland Clinic will also be home to the world’s first on-premise Q System Two – IBM’s ‘next generation 1,000+ qubit' system – in the future. The company's most powerful quantum chip is currently the 127-qubit Eagle, announced last year; the 433-qubit Osprey is due to launch sometime this year.
“A step change in the way we solve scientific problems is on the horizon,” said Dr. Ruoyi Zhou, Director, IBM Research - Cleveland Clinic Partnership. “At IBM, we’re more motivated than ever to create with Cleveland Clinic and others lasting communities of discovery and harness the power of quantum computing, AI, and hybrid cloud to usher in a new era of accelerated discovery in healthcare and life sciences.”
IBM operates a number of Quantum machines out of a data center in New York that it has made available through a portal, but has also signed agreements to install a number of on-premise facilities in Europe, Asia, and North America. It is also installing more machines at IBM facilities in various markets including Japan and Canada.
This month Oxford Quantum Circuits announced plans to deploy one of its quantum computers in a Cyxtera data center in the UK outside London. It is the first public deployment of a quantum system in a retail colocation facility.
D-Wave launches on AWS
This month D-Wave became the latest quantum vendor to offer its technologies through the cloud. The company last week announced it has launched in AWS Marketplace; offering real-time access to D-Wave’s quantum computers via its Leap Quantum Cloud Service as well as a number of consulting and other services.
“The era of commercial quantum computing is here. Forward-looking organizations are increasingly turning to quantum computing to find solutions for today’s complex and computationally intensive business problems, ultimately to reduce costs and increase revenue,” said Mark Snedeker, senior vice president of growth at D-Wave. “By launching in AWS Marketplace, we’re introducing our Leap quantum computing service to AWS customers, enabling them to quickly and easily start deriving business value from quantum computing, today.”

IBM is releasing Qiskit Machine Learning, a set of new application modules that’s part of its open source quantum software. The new feature is the latest expansion of the company’s broader effort to get more developers to begin experimenting with quantum computers.
According to a blog post by the Qiskit Applications Team, the machine learning modules promise to help optimize machine learning by using quantum computers for some parts of the process.
“Quantum computation offers another potential avenue to increase the power of machine learning models, and the corresponding literature is growing at an incredible pace,” the team wrote. “Quantum machine learning (QML) proposes new types of models that leverage quantum computers’ unique capabilities to, for example, work in exponentially higher-dimensional feature spaces to improve the accuracy of models.”
Rather than replacing current computer architectures, IBM is betting that quantum computers will gain traction in the coming years by taking on very specific tasks that are offloaded from a classic computing system to a quantum platform. AI and machine learning are among the areas where IBM has said it’s hopeful that quantum can make an impact.

To make quantum more accessible, last year IBM introduced an open source quantum programming framework called Qiskit. The company has said it has the potential to speed up some applications by 100 times.
In the case of machine learning, the hope is that a system that offloads tasks to a quantum system could accelerate the training time. However, challenges remain, such as how to get large data sets in and out of the quantum machine without adding time that would cancel out any gains by the quantum calculations.
Developers who use Qiskit to improve their algorithms will have access to test them on IBM’s cloud-based quantum computing platform.

The milestone, known as quantum supremacy, comes just over a year after Google became the first in the world to achieve the same feat.
The team from the University of Science and Technology of China built a quantum computer capable of performing computations nearly 100 trillion times faster than the world’s most powerful supercomputer, according to a research paper published in the journal Science.
China’s leading quantum computing researchers revealed that their next-generation machine used a completely different set up compared to Google, proving that there are multiple approaches to this nascent technology.
The researchers claimed their prototype was 10 billion times faster than Google’s machine, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Quantum computers were first theorised nearly 40 years ago by the physicist Richard Feynman, but practical machines are only now beginning to be realised.
They work by replacing traditional bits – the ‘1’s’ and ‘0’s’ used to encode digital information – with quantum bits, or qubits. These are able to function as both a ‘1’ and a ‘0’ at the same time by existing in a state of superposition, meaning each new qubit added to the computer increases is power exponentially rather than linearly.
The emergence of quantum computers holds the promise of making information processing exponentially more powerful in order to transform everything from disease treatment, to eliminating traffic.
However security experts have also warned that the unfathomably fast computers pose a major threat to modern forms of encryption that systems of finance, communication and government currently rely upon.
This could ultimately pose a threat to national security, with the United States already warning that advances in China could see the US fall behind in the technological arms race.
A 2019 report by the Center for a New American Security stated: “The United States must be prepared for a future in which its traditional technological predominance faces new, perhaps unprecedented challenges.”",2196,"['gelqicm', 'gelxzw0', 'gelon79', 'gelqm8o', 'gelqoow', 'gelqja7', 'gelxoxp', 'gelrboa', 'gelvwcu', 'gem1qsi', 'gem8b15', 'gelq6di', 'gelt1sf', 'gem4zml', 'geltlzr', 'gem8d6m', 'gemytg2', 'gend1iu', 'genek7h', 'genxy87', 'geo506c', 'geo9qy9', 'geoj4np', 'geqz8mi', 'gf0fy13', 'gelre29', 'gesitiy', 'gelqicm', 'gelxzw0', 'gelon79', 'gelqm8o', 'gelqoow', 'gelqja7', 'gelxoxp', 'gelrboa', 'gelvwcu', 'gem1qsi', 'gem8b15', 'gelq6di', 'gelt1sf', 'gem4zml', 'geltlzr', 'gem8d6m', 'gemytg2', 'gend1iu', 'genek7h', 'genxy87', 'geo506c', 'geo9qy9', 'geoj4np', 'geqz8mi', 'gf0fy13', 'gelre29', 'gesitiy']"

The new research shows that it is possible to make robust and reliable silicon-based quantum computers, that would be compatible with the existing manufacturing technology we have.
Three separate papers in Nature together show that such silicon-based quantum processors are dependable and efficient enough that they could be made and used in the real world.
Each of the three papers show quantum computers that are more than 99.9 per cent error free, far above the 99 per cent threshold considered as the standard for fault-tolerant computers. As such, they could finally be ready to be used for actual applications.
“When the errors are so rare, it becomes possible to detect them and correct them when they occur,” said Andrea Morello from the University of New South Wales, the leader of one of those three pieces of research. “This shows that it is possible to build quantum computers that have enough scale, and enough power, to handle meaningful computation.”
Professor Morello’s is presented in Nature alongside another paper from a team in the Netherlands, and another from Japan.
Quantum computers, if they work, are expected to change the world, offering vastly more computing power and different ways of doing calculations than was ever possible before. Researchers across the world are racing to build larger quantum systems, of the scale and complexity required for useful applications.
But that work has been hampered by a whole host of difficulties. One of the problems is the noise generated in the qubits that are at the heart of the technology, which makes them prone to errors – and as the number of qubits increases, so does that noise, making it difficult to scale up the systems.
For them to actually be useful, researchers believe that a system would be required to hit a threshold of at least 99 per cent. Until now, scientists have only done that in other kinds of circuits, but they are difficult to build up to enough of a scale to actually make the computers both reliable and large-scale enough to be useful.
Through a variety of new breakthroughs, however, the researchers behind the new paper were able to reach that threshold and do it using technology which can already be produced at large scales, given it is similar to the semiconductor fabrication that happens today for classical computers.
Scientists hope that the research now shows that silicon can be used to make successful quantum computers – and that they can now get to work designing them to be larger and more capable.
“You typically need error rates below 1 per cent, to apply quantum error correction protocols,” said Professor Morello. “Having now achieved this goal, we can start designing silicon quantum processors that scale up and operate reliably for useful calculations.”",2916,"['htg026z', 'htfm4d3', 'htgh2w4', 'htgm5zw', 'hthxpaj']"

- The report says quantum networking is closer to ready than more-hyped quantum computers.
- Notably, there are no real timeframes, just large hardware and implementation goals.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) has announced a plan to make a quantum internet it says is virtually unhackable. This is definitely a long-term plan that will require new kinds of engineering and technology, not something that will be implemented next year. Let’s take a look at the concept, the plan the DoE has laid out, and how long it all might take.
Within the framework of quantum mechanics, the network proposed here is pretty intuitive. (That’s a big caveat, though!) The report begins with a surprising notion: Although headlines and research have focused on the power of quantum computing, we’re far away from any practical and recognizable computer powered by quantum phenomena. The idea of a quantum network, the DoE says, is far closer to our reach.
🤯 You like quantum. We like quantum. Let's nerd out together.
Think of how rapidly fiber optic internet increased our connection speed capacity while computers have remained basically the same. Having a firehose-sized bandwidth can harmonize with great up-to-date hardware to improve the entire experience, letting people stream HD video and more onto hardware that could often already do it. And a quantum internet could rapidly increase even over high fiber speeds.
How will a quantum link make this happen? The DoE explains in a statement:
“It works through two quantum phenomena: the first is quantum entanglement, where two particles can become so inextricably linked that no matter how much distance separates them, changing the properties of one will change those of the other. And since that communication happens instantly, a quantum internet could be much faster than today’s networks.”
“The second phenomenon is quantum superposition, where a particle can exist in two different states at once,” the DoE continues. “This is what enables tighter security of the information shared across a quantum network. Information is encoded into entangled pairs of photons, in a superposition of states—in data terms that means they represent both a one and a zero at the same time.” (Keen-eyed hardware observers know that quantum encryption was one of the foremost suggested applications of the technology.)
In the report, researchers explain the experimental environment allows for very tiny versions of specific networking setups only, like the part where entanglement is tested across great distances to prove the hypothetical case. For any scalable version of this technology, we’ll need the full complement of networking equipment, including all the interfaces to link up with satellites, repeaters to keep the signal going, and memory buffers that will help with transmission. All has to be compatible with quantum technology, requiring an almost all-new paradigm.
The DoE researchers lay out five milestones. The first is to make sure quantum technology can do many of the tasks we use networks for now, like exchanging data safely and completely with minimal loss. By the final milestone, a complete network of government and university nodes should be able to transition to the infrastructure for home and commercial users.
If that sounds ambitious, remember the government developed all the groundwork and the actual technology of what we now think of as the internet.
The report cites exciting test cases, like a 2019 experiment in China where scientists showed quantum entanglement across 745 miles. This, too, mirrors the past—not only when local networks were joined until they formed a true World Wide Web, but even when engineers were developing radios to transmit wirelessly from remote cities or when telegraph companies laid the very first cables across the ocean.

The Chicago network, which will soon be opened to academia and industry, will become one of the nation’s first publicly-available testbeds for quantum security technology.
The network is now actively running quantum security protocols using technology provided by Toshiba, distributing quantum keys over optic cable at a speed of over 80,000 quantum bits per second between Chicago and the western suburbs. Toshiba’s participation in the project makes the Chicago network a unique collaboration between academia, government and industry.
Researchers will use the Chicago network to test new communication devices, security protocols, and algorithms that will eventually connect distant quantum computers around the nation and the world. The work represents the next step towards a national quantum internet, which will have a profound impact on communications, computing, and national security.

The achievement, which occurred two years ahead of schedule, represents a major milestone in the race to build the world’s first quantum computer, and demonstrates the team’s ability to control the quantum states of electrons and atoms in silicon at an exquisite level not achieved before.
In a paper published today in the journal Nature, the researchers described how they were able to mimic the structure and energy states of the organic compound polyacetylene – a repeating chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms distinguished by alternating single and double bonds of carbon.
Lead researcher and former Australian of the Year, Scientia Professor Michelle Simmons, said the team at Silicon Quantum Computing, one of UNSW’s most exciting start-ups, built a quantum integrated circuit comprising a chain of 10 quantum dots to simulate the precise location of atoms in the polyacetylene chain.
“If you go back to the 1950s, Richard Feynman said you can't understand how nature works unless you can build matter at the same length scale,” Prof. Simmons said.
“And so that’s what we're doing, we're literally building it from the bottom up, where we are mimicking the polyacetylene molecule by putting atoms in silicon with the exact distances that represent the single and double carbon-carbon bonds.”
Chain reaction
The research relied on measuring the electric current through a deliberately engineered 10-quantum dot replica of the polyacetylene molecule as each new electron passed from the source outlet of the device to the drain – the other end of the circuit.
To be doubly sure, they simulated two different strands of the polymer chains.
In the first device they cut a snippet of the chain to leave double bonds at the end giving 10 peaks in the current. In the second device they cut a different snippet of the chain to leave single bonds at the end only giving rise to two peaks in the current. The current that passes through each chain was therefore dramatically different due to the different bond lengths of the atoms at the end of the chain.
Not only did the measurements match the theoretical predictions, they matched perfectly.
'We should have some kind of commercial outcome from our technology five years from now.' - Michelle Simmons
“What it's showing is that you can literally mimic what actually happens in the real molecule. And that's why it's exciting because the signatures of the two chains are very different,” Prof. Simmons said.
“Most of the other quantum computing architectures out there haven't got the ability to engineer atoms with sub-nanometer precision or allow the atoms to sit that close.
“And so that means that now we can start to understand more and more complicated molecules based on putting the atoms in place as if they're mimicking the real physical system.”
Standing at the edge
According to Prof. Simmons, it was no accident that a carbon chain of 10 atoms was chosen because that sits within the size limit of what a classical computer is able to compute, with up to 1024 separate interactions of electrons in that system. Increasing it to a 20-dot chain would see the number of possible interactions rise exponentially, making it difficult for a classical computer to solve.
“We're near the limit of what classical computers can do, so it's like stepping off the edge into the unknown,” she says.
“And this is the thing that’s exciting, we can now make bigger devices that are beyond what a classical computer can model. So we can look at molecules that haven't been simulated before. We're going to be able to understand the world in a different way, addressing fundamental questions that we've never been able to solve before.”
One of the questions Prof. Simmons alluded to is about understanding and mimicking photosynthesis – how plants use light to create chemical energy for growth. Or understanding how to optimise the design of catalysts used for fertilisers, currently a high-energy, high-cost process.
“So there’re huge implications for fundamentally understanding how nature works,” she said.
Future quantum computers
Much has been written about quantum computers in the last three decades with the billion-dollar question always being ‘but when can we see one?’.
Prof. Simmons says that the development of quantum computers is on a comparable trajectory to how classical computers evolved – from a transistor in 1947 to an integrated circuit in 1958, and then small computing chips that went into commercial products like calculators approximately five years after that.
“And so we're now replicating that roadmap for quantum computers,” Prof. Simmons says.
“We started with a single atom transistor in 2012. And this latest result, realised in 2021 is the equivalent of the atom-scale quantum integrated circuit, two years ahead of time. If we map it to the evolution of classical computing, we're predicting we should have some kind of commercial outcome from our technology five years from now.”
One of the advantages that the UNSW/SQC team’s research brings is that the technology is scalable because it manages to use fewer components in the circuit to control the qubits – the basic bits of quantum information.
“In quantum systems, you need something that creates the qubits, some kind of structure in the device that allows you to form the quantum state,” Prof. Simmons says.
“In our system, the atoms themselves create the qubits, requiring fewer elements in the circuits. We only needed six metallic gates to control the electrons in our 10-dot system – in other words, we have fewer gates than there are active device components. Whereas most quantum computing architectures need almost double the number or more of the control systems to move the electrons in the qubit architecture.”
Needing fewer components packed in tightly together minimises the amount of any interference with the quantum states, allowing devices to be scaled up to make more complex and powerful quantum systems.
“So that very low physical gate density is also very exciting for us, because it shows that we've got this nice clean system that we can manipulate, keeping coherence across long distances with minimal overhead in the gates. That's why it's valuable for scalable quantum computing.”
Looking ahead, Prof. Simmons and her colleagues will explore larger compounds that may have been predicted theoretically, but have never been simulated and fully understood before, such as high temperature superconductors.",6715,"['idezo1b', 'idf4h0a', 'idfa53x', 'idgypy7', 'idh1ufp', 'idj7ams']"

A special form of light made using an ancient Namibian gemstone could be the key to new light-based quantum computers, which could solve long-held scientific mysteries, according to new research led by the University of St Andrews.
The research, conducted in collaboration with scientists at Harvard University in the US, Macquarie University in Australia and Aarhus University in Denmark and published in Nature Materials, used a naturally mined cuprous oxide (Cu2O) gemstone from Namibia to produce Rydberg polaritons, the largest hybrid particles of light and matter ever created.
Rydberg polaritons switch continually from light to matter and back again. In Rydberg polaritons, light and matter are like two sides of a coin, and the matter side is what makes polaritons interact with each other.
This interaction is crucial because this is what allows the creation of quantum simulators, a special type of quantum computer, where information is stored in quantum bits. These quantum bits, unlike the binary bits in classical computers that can only be 0 or 1, can take any value between 0 and 1. They can therefore store much more information and perform several processes simultaneously.
This capability could allow quantum simulators to solve important mysteries of physics, chemistry and biology, for example, how to make high-temperature superconductors for highspeed trains, how cheaper fertilizers could be made potentially solving global hunger, or how proteins fold making it easier to produce more effective drugs.
Project lead Dr. Hamid Ohadi, of the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, says that ""making a quantum simulator with light is the holy grail of science. We have taken a huge leap towards this by creating Rydberg polaritons, the key ingredient of it.""
To create Rydberg polaritons, the researchers trapped light between two highly reflective mirrors. A cuprous oxide crystal from a stone mined in Namibia was then thinned and polished to a 30-micrometer thick slab (thinner than a strand of human hair) and sandwiched between the two mirrors to make Rydberg polaritons 100 times larger than ever demonstrated before.
One of the leading authors Dr. Sai Kiran Rajendran, of the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, says that ""purchasing the stone on eBay was easy. The challenge was to make Rydberg polaritons that exist in an extremely narrow color range.""
The team is currently further refining these methods in order to explore the possibility of making quantum circuits, which are the next ingredient for quantum simulators.

Russian scientists from University of Science and Technology MISIS and Bauman Moscow State Technical University were one of the first in the world to implement a two-qubit operation using superconducting fluxonium qubits. Fluxoniums have a longer life cycle and a greater precision of operations, so they are used to make longer algorithms. An article on research that brings the creation of a quantum computer closer to reality has been published in npj Quantum Information.
One of the main questions in the development of a universal quantum computer is about qubits. Namely, which quantum objects are the best to make processors for quantum computers: electrons, photons, ions, superconductors, or other ""quantum transistors."" Superconducting qubits have become one of the most successful platforms for quantum computing during the past decade. To date, the most commercially successful superconducting qubits are transmons, which are actively investigated and used in the quantum developments of Google, IBM and other world leading laboratories.
The main task of a qubit is to store and process information without errors. Accidental noise and even mere observation can lead to the loss or alteration of data. The stable operation of superconducting qubits often requires extremely low ambient temperatures—close to zero Kelvin, which is hundreds of times colder than the temperature of open space.
Russian physicists from the Superconducting Metamaterials laboratory at MISIS University and Bauman Moscow State Technical University were one of the first in the world to implement a two-qubit operation using superconducting fluxonium qubits. To protect qubits from noise, the researchers added to the circuit a superinductor (a superconducting element with a high level of resistance to alternating current) which is a chain of 40 Josephson contacts—structures of two superconductors separated by a thin layer of dielectric.
""Fluxonium qubits are more complex and less studied than transmons. The main advantage of fluxoniums is that they can be operated at a low frequency of about 600 MHz. We know that the lower the frequency, the longer the lifetime of qubits, which means that more operations can be performed with them. During the tests, it turned out that the dielectric losses of fluxonium qubits allow to keep the state of the superposition longer than that of transmons,"" said Ilya Besedin, one of the authors of the study, an engineer of the scientific project at the NUST MISIS Superconducting Metamaterials laboratory.
To implement a universal set of logical operations, scientists used high-precision two-qubit gates: fSim and CZ. In order to bring the qubits into resonance with each other, parametric modulation of the flow of one of the qubits of the system was used. The authors of the study note, that due to the tunable coupling element, it was simultaneously possible not only to obtain the accuracy of two-qubit operations above 99.22%, but also to suppress the residual ZZ interaction between the qubits, which allowed to perform parallel single-qubit operations with an accuracy of 99.97%.
""The low frequency of computational qubits opens the way not only to longer qubits' lifetimes and accuracy of valve operations, which will lead to making longer algorithms, but also makes it possible to use subgigahertz electronics in qubit control lines, which significantly reduces the complexity of the quantum processor control system,"" said Ilya Besedin.
The obtained results reveal an interesting and promising approach toward fault-tolerant quantum computing with low-frequency qubits that can be a good alternative to the transmon system.
In the future, scientists plan to continue research with computations based on fluxonium qubits, optimizing the qubit control system, improving readout rates and beginning to develop multi-qubit systems based on them.

A happy accident in the laboratory has led to a breakthrough discovery that not only solved a problem that stood for more than half a century, but has major implications for the development of quantum computers and sensors.In a study published today in Nature, a team of engineers at UNSW Sydney has done what a celebrated scientist first suggested in 1961 was possible, but has eluded everyone since: controlling the nucleus of a single atom using only electric fields.
""This discovery means that we now have a pathway to build quantum computers using single-atom spins without the need for any oscillating magnetic field for their operation,"" says UNSW's Scientia Professor of Quantum Engineering Andrea Morello. ""Moreover, we can use these nuclei as exquisitely precise sensors of electric and magnetic fields, or to answer fundamental questions in quantum science.""
That a nuclear spin can be controlled with electric, instead of magnetic fields, has far-reaching consequences. Generating magnetic fields requires large coils and high currents, while the laws of physics dictate that it is difficult to confine magnetic fields to very small spaces—they tend to have a wide area of influence. Electric fields, on the other hand, can be produced at the tip of a tiny electrode, and they fall off very sharply away from the tip. This will make control of individual atoms placed in nanoelectronic devices much easier.
A new paradigm
Prof Morello says the discovery shakes up the paradigm of nuclear magnetic resonance, a widely used technique in fields as disparate as medicine, chemistry, or mining. ""Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is one of the most widespread techniques in modern physics, chemistry, and even medicine or mining,"" he says. ""Doctors use it to see inside a patient's body in great detail while mining companies use it to analyse rock samples. This all works extremely well, but for certain applications, the need to use magnetic fields to control and detect the nuclei can be a disadvantage.""
Prof Morello uses the analogy of a billiard table to explain the difference between controlling nuclear spins with magnetic and electric fields.
""Performing magnetic resonance is like trying to move a particular ball on a billiard table by lifting and shaking the whole table,"" he says. ""We'll move the intended ball, but we'll also move all the others.""
""The breakthrough of electric resonance is like being handed an actual billiards stick to hit the ball exactly where you want it.""
Amazingly, Prof Morello was completely unaware that his team had cracked a longstanding problem in finding a way to control nuclear spins with electric fields, first suggested in 1961 by a pioneer of magnetic resonance and Nobel Laureate, Nicolaas Bloembergen.
""I have worked on spin resonance for 20 years of my life, but honestly, I had never heard of this idea of nuclear electric resonance,"" Prof Morello says. ""We 'rediscovered' this effect by complete accident—it would never have occurred to me to look for it. The whole field of nuclear electric resonance has been almost dormant for more than half a century, after the first attempts to demonstrate it proved too challenging.""
Out of curiosity
The researchers had originally set out to perform nuclear magnetic resonance on a single atom of antimony—an element that possesses a large nuclear spin. One of the lead authors of the work, Dr. Serwan Asaad, explains: ""Our original goal was to explore the boundary between the quantum world and the classical world, set by the chaotic behaviour of the nuclear spin. This was purely a curiosity-driven project, with no application in mind.""
""However, once we started the experiment, we realised that something was wrong. The nucleus behaved very strangely, refusing to respond at certain frequencies, but showing a strong response at others,"" recalls Dr. Vincent Mourik, also a lead author on the paper.
""This puzzled us for a while, until we had a 'eureka moment' and realised that we were doing electric resonance instead of magnetic resonance.""
Dr. Asaad continued: ""What happened is that we fabricated a device containing an antimony atom and a special antenna, optimized to create a high-frequency magnetic field to control the nucleus of the atom. Our experiment demands this magnetic field to be quite strong, so we applied a lot of power to the antenna, and we blew it up!""
Game on
""Normally, with smaller nuclei like phosphorus, when you blow up the antenna it's 'game over' and you have to throw away the device,"" says Dr. Mourik.""But with the antimony nucleus, the experiment continued to work. It turns out that after the damage, the antenna was creating a strong electric field instead of a magnetic field. So we 'rediscovered' nuclear electric resonance.""
After demonstrating the ability to control the nucleus with electric fields, the researchers used sophisticated computer modelling to understand how exactly the electric field influences the spin of the nucleus. This effort highlighted that nuclear electric resonance is a truly local, microscopic phenomenon: the electric field distorts the atomic bonds around the nucleus, causing it to reorient itself.
""This landmark result will open up a treasure trove of discoveries and applications,"" says Prof Morello. ""The system we created has enough complexity to study how the classical world we experience every day emerges from the quantum realm. Moreover, we can use its quantum complexity to build sensors of electromagnetic fields with vastly improved sensitivity. And all this, in a simple electronic device made in silicon, controlled with small voltages applied to a metal electrode!""

A new quantum sensor can analyze the full spectrum of radio frequency and real-world signals, unleashing new potentials for soldier communications, spectrum awareness and electronic warfare.
The Rydberg sensor uses laser beams to create highly-excited Rydberg atoms directly above a microwave circuit, to boost and hone in on the portion of the spectrum being measured. The Rydberg atoms are sensitive to the circuit's voltage, enabling the device to be used as a sensitive probe for the wide range of signals in the RF spectrum.
""All previous demonstrations of Rydberg atomic sensors have only been able to sense small and specific regions of the RF spectrum, but our sensor now operates continuously over a wide frequency range for the first time,"" said Dr. Kevin Cox, a researcher at the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, now known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory. ""This is a really important step toward proving that quantum sensors can provide a new, and dominant, set of capabilities for our Soldiers, who are operating in an increasingly complex electro-magnetic battlespace.""
The Rydberg spectrum analyzer has the potential to surpass fundamental limitations of traditional electronics in sensitivity, bandwidth and frequency range. Because of this, the lab's Rydberg spectrum analyzer and other quantum sensors have the potential to unlock a new frontier of Army sensors for spectrum awareness, electronic warfare, sensing and communications—part of the Army's modernization strategy.
""Devices that are based on quantum constituents are one of the Army's top priorities to enable technical surprise in the competitive future battlespace,"" said Army researcher Dr. David Meyer. ""Quantum sensors in general, including the one demonstrated here, offer unparalleled sensitivity and accuracy to detect a wide range of mission-critical signals.""
The peer-reviewed journal Physical Review Applied published the researchers' findings, Waveguide-coupled Rydberg spectrum analyzer from 0 to 20 GigaHerz, co-authored by Army researchers Drs. David Meyer, Paul Kunz, and Kevin Cox
The researchers plan additional development to improve the signal sensitivity of the Rydberg spectrum analyzer, aiming to outperform existing state-of-the-art technology.
""Significant physics and engineering effort is still necessary before the Rydberg analyzer can integrate into a field-testable device,"" Cox said.

The quantum computing market is projected to reach $65 billion by 2030, a hot topic for investors and scientists alike because of its potential to solve incomprehensibly complex problems.
Drug discovery is one example. To understand drug interactions, a pharmaceutical company might want to simulate the interaction of two molecules. The challenge is that each molecule is composed of a few hundred atoms, and scientists must model all the ways in which these atoms might array themselves when their respective molecules are introduced. The number of possible configurations is infinite—more than the number of atoms in the entire universe. Only a quantum computer can represent, much less solve, such an expansive, dynamic data problem.
Mainstream use of quantum computing remains decades away, while research teams in universities and private industry across the globe work on different dimensions of the technology.
A research team led by Xu Yi, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science, has carved a niche in the physics and applications of photonic devices, which detect and shape light for a wide range of uses including communications and computing. His research group has created a scalable quantum computing platform, which drastically reduces the number of devices needed to achieve quantum speed, on a photonic chip the size of a penny.
Olivier Pfister, professor of quantum optics and quantum information at UVA, and Hansuek Lee, assistant professor at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, contributed to this success.
Nature Communications recently published the team's experimental results, A Squeezed Quantum Microcomb on a Chip. Two of Yi's group members, Zijiao Yang, a Ph.D. student in physics, and Mandana Jahanbozorgi, a Ph.D. student of electrical and computer engineering, are the paper's co-first authors. A grant from the National Science Foundation's Engineering Quantum Integrated Platforms for Quantum Communication program supports this research.
Quantum computing promises an entirely new way of processing information. Your desktop or laptop computer processes information in long strings of bits. A bit can hold only one of two values: zero or one. Quantum computers process information in parallel, which means they don't have to wait for one sequence of information to be processed before they can compute more. Their unit of information is called a qubit, a hybrid that can be one and zero at the same time. A quantum mode, or qumode, spans the full spectrum of variables between one and zero—the values to the right of the decimal point.
Researchers are working on different approaches to efficiently produce the enormous number of qumodes needed to achieve quantum speeds.
Yi's photonics-based approach is attractive because a field of light is also full spectrum; each light wave in the spectrum has the potential to become a quantum unit. Yi hypothesized that by entangling fields of light, the light would achieve a quantum state.
You are likely familiar with the optical fibers that deliver information through the internet. Within each optical fiber, lasers of many different colors are used in parallel, a phenomenon called multiplexing. Yi carried the multiplexing concept into the quantum realm.
Micro is key to his team's success. UVA is a pioneer and a leader in the use of optical multiplexing to create a scalable quantum computing platform. In 2014, Pfister's group succeeded in generating more than 3,000 quantum modes in a bulk optical system. However, using this many quantum modes requires a large footprint to contain the thousands of mirrors, lenses and other components that would be needed to run an algorithm and perform other operations.
""The future of the field is integrated quantum optics,"" Pfister said. ""Only by transferring quantum optics experiments from protected optics labs to field-compatible photonic chips will bona fide quantum technology be able to see the light of day. We are extremely fortunate to have been able to attract to UVA a world expert in quantum photonics such as Xu Yi, and I'm very excited by the perspectives these new results open to us.""
Yi's group created a quantum source in an optical microresonator a ring-shaped, millimeter-sized structure that envelopes the photons and generates a microcobe, a device that efficiently converts photons from single to multiple wavelengths. Light circulates around the ring to build up optical power. This power buildup enhances chances for photons to interact, which produces quantum entanglement between fields of light in the microcomb.
Through multiplexing, Yi's team verified the generation of 40 qumodes from a single microresonator on a chip, proving that multiplexing of quantum modes can work in integrated photonic platforms. This is just the number they are able to measure.
""We estimate that when we optimize the system, we can generate thousands of qumodes from a single device,"" Yi said.
Yi's multiplexing technique opens a path toward quantum computing for real-world conditions, where errors are inevitable. This is true even in classical computers. But quantum states are much more fragile than classical states.
The number of qubits needed to compensate for errors could exceed one million, with a proportionate increase in the number of devices. Multiplexing reduces the number of devices needed by two or three orders of magnitude.
Yi's photonics-based system offers two additional advantages in the quantum computing quest. Quantum computing platforms that use superconducting electronic circuits require cooling to cryogenic temperatures. Because the photon has no mass, quantum computers with photonic integrated chips can run or sleep at room temperature. Additionally, Lee fabricated the microresonator on a silicon chip using standard lithography techniques. This is important because it implies the resonator or quantum source can be mass-produced.
""We are proud to push the frontiers of engineering in quantum computing and accelerate the transition from bulk optics to integrated photonics,"" Yi said. ""We will continue to explore ways to integrate devices and circuits in a photonics-based quantum computing platform and optimize its performance.""

A team of scientists at the University of Sussex have for the first time built a modular quantum brain scanner, and used it to record a brain signal. This is the first time a brain signal has been detected using a modular quantum brain sensor anywhere in the world. It's a major milestone for all researchers working on quantum brain imaging technology because modular sensors can be scaled up, like Lego bricks. The team have also connected two sensors like Lego bricks, proving that whole-brain scanning using this method is within reach—as detailed in their paper, which is published today in pre-print. This has not been possible with the currently commercially available quantum brain sensors from the United States.
These modular devices work like play bricks in that they can be connected together. This opens up the potential for whole-brain scanning using quantum technology, and potential advances for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.
The device, which was built at the Quantum Systems and Devices laboratory at the university, uses ultra-sensitive quantum sensors to pick up these tiniest of magnetic fields to see inside the brain in order to map the neural activity.
The team applied the sensors to outside of a participant's scalp, close to the visual cortex of the brain. They asked the participant to open and close their eyes at 10–20 second intervals, and were able to detect a signal. This is a very simple action, but to see it happening inside the brain—from the outside—requires hugely sophisticated quantum technology.
Thomas Coussens Ph.D. student at the University of Sussex, who built the sensor, explained:
""Our quantum sensor has to be exceptionally sensitive to pick up the magnetic fields in the brain which are very weak indeed. To put it into context, the magnetic field of a brain is a trillion times lower than that of a fridge magnet.
""Because our device is so-far unique in that it is modular—and we've shown the modularity works by connecting two sensors together—we now plan to scale up this project by building more sensors to turn this into an entire brain imaging system. This could provide significant advancements in detecting and delivering treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.
""This is the culmination of many months of hard work and I am thrilled to see our first brain signal using our very own quantum sensors built entirely by us here at the University of Sussex.""
Professor Peter Krüger, Experimental Physicist and Director of the Sussex Programme for Quantum Research at the University of Sussex explained:
""As our sensor works on a modular basis, we will now be able to scale it up to create much more detailed images of the brain or parts of the brain. You can't do that with the current commercial product available. This new sensor built at the University of Sussex opens the door for UK-produced quantum sensors, hugely important in the wider UK quantum technology landscape.
""To have this sensor is a major step to further interdisciplinary studies involving researchers ranging from consciousness scientists and engineers to neuroscientists which is very much in the spirit of how we tackle research here at Sussex.""
Professor Kai Bongs, Principal Investigator at the UK Quantum Technology Hub Sensors and Timing, said:
""We are delighted with this ground-breaking development by Hub researchers at the University of Sussex. These successes are helping considerably to advance the UK quantum ecosystem, bringing us a step closer to exploiting quantum sensor technology in clinical applications that will have real societal impact. Building a strong quantum brain imaging capability in the UK is a great example of our collaboration.""
The quantum magnetic sensor uses an optically pumped magnetometer inside a magnetic shield to reduce environmental magnetic fields and ensure they are not being detected. In simple terms, the sensor works by putting a vapor into a quantum state, shining a laser beam through it and using a photo detector to see how much light has gone through. How the atomic vapor interacts with the laser light very sensitively depends on the magnetic field. The tiny electric currents in the neurons in the brain lead to very small magnetic fields even outside the brain which is what the sensor picks up.

- The report says quantum networking is closer to ready than more-hyped quantum computers.
- Notably, there are no real timeframes, just large hardware and implementation goals.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) has announced a plan to make a quantum internet it says is virtually unhackable. This is definitely a long-term plan that will require new kinds of engineering and technology, not something that will be implemented next year. Let’s take a look at the concept, the plan the DoE has laid out, and how long it all might take.
Within the framework of quantum mechanics, the network proposed here is pretty intuitive. (That’s a big caveat, though!) The report begins with a surprising notion: Although headlines and research have focused on the power of quantum computing, we’re far away from any practical and recognizable computer powered by quantum phenomena. The idea of a quantum network, the DoE says, is far closer to our reach.
🤯 You like quantum. We like quantum. Let's nerd out together.
Think of how rapidly fiber optic internet increased our connection speed capacity while computers have remained basically the same. Having a firehose-sized bandwidth can harmonize with great up-to-date hardware to improve the entire experience, letting people stream HD video and more onto hardware that could often already do it. And a quantum internet could rapidly increase even over high fiber speeds.
How will a quantum link make this happen? The DoE explains in a statement:
“It works through two quantum phenomena: the first is quantum entanglement, where two particles can become so inextricably linked that no matter how much distance separates them, changing the properties of one will change those of the other. And since that communication happens instantly, a quantum internet could be much faster than today’s networks.”
“The second phenomenon is quantum superposition, where a particle can exist in two different states at once,” the DoE continues. “This is what enables tighter security of the information shared across a quantum network. Information is encoded into entangled pairs of photons, in a superposition of states—in data terms that means they represent both a one and a zero at the same time.” (Keen-eyed hardware observers know that quantum encryption was one of the foremost suggested applications of the technology.)
In the report, researchers explain the experimental environment allows for very tiny versions of specific networking setups only, like the part where entanglement is tested across great distances to prove the hypothetical case. For any scalable version of this technology, we’ll need the full complement of networking equipment, including all the interfaces to link up with satellites, repeaters to keep the signal going, and memory buffers that will help with transmission. All has to be compatible with quantum technology, requiring an almost all-new paradigm.
The DoE researchers lay out five milestones. The first is to make sure quantum technology can do many of the tasks we use networks for now, like exchanging data safely and completely with minimal loss. By the final milestone, a complete network of government and university nodes should be able to transition to the infrastructure for home and commercial users.
If that sounds ambitious, remember the government developed all the groundwork and the actual technology of what we now think of as the internet.
The report cites exciting test cases, like a 2019 experiment in China where scientists showed quantum entanglement across 745 miles. This, too, mirrors the past—not only when local networks were joined until they formed a true World Wide Web, but even when engineers were developing radios to transmit wirelessly from remote cities or when telegraph companies laid the very first cables across the ocean.

Knowing you've got yourself an authentic time crystal takes more than a keen eye for high-quality gems.
In a new study, an international team of researchers used Google's Sycamore quantum computing hardware to double-check their theoretical vision of a time crystal, confirming it ticks all of the right boxes for an emerging form of technology we're still getting our head around.
Similar to conventional crystals made of endlessly repeating units of atoms, a time crystal is an infinitely repeating change in a system, one that remarkably doesn't require energy to enter or leave.
Though such a thing comes close to breaking certain laws of thermodynamics, the fact that the system's entropy doesn't increase means it should sit on the right side of physics.
In reality, such a crystal might look like an oscillation of some sort that doesn't synchronize with the rest of the system's rhythms. A laser tapping out a steady beat on your time crystal, for example, might make its particles' spins flip only on every other tap.
But the sheer complexity of a huge number of interacting quantum objects all swinging to their own rhythm leaves some wiggle room for explanations that aren't necessarily dependent on the same rules that underpin time crystal physics.
So while unlikely, we can't rule out that a system that initially looks like a time crystal might in reality warm up over the eons and eventually fall into disarray.
You could just sit and watch your crystal hum away until the eventual heat death of the Universe, of course. Or you could let a quantum computer carry out the job for you.
""The big picture is that we are taking the devices that are meant to be the quantum computers of the future and thinking of them as complex quantum systems in their own right,"" says Stanford University physicist Matteo Ippoliti.
""Instead of computation, we're putting the computer to work as a new experimental platform to realize and detect new phases of matter.""
The starting place for this particular time crystal was a surprisingly unintentional one, emerging from work conducted by Stanford theoretical physicist Vedika Khemani on non-equilibrium physics.
We're intimately familiar with the consequences of this kind of physics in everyday life. Leave your hot cup of coffee out on the bench for half an hour, and you'll discover how quickly its heat energy dissipates as it sits out of equilibrium with its environment.
Khemani and her colleagues were more interested in the imbalance of energy on the far less intuitive level of quantum physics.
It was only when a reviewer of Khemani's research drew her attention to similarities between her own work and time crystals that she turned her focus to this exciting new field of physics.
""Time-crystals are a striking example of a new type of non-equilibrium quantum phase of matter,"" says Khemani.
""While much of our understanding of condensed matter physics is based on equilibrium systems, these new quantum devices are providing us a fascinating window into new non-equilibrium regimes in many-body physics.""
Modelling their time crystal on Google's quantum technology allowed the team to look for signs of infinite repetition within just a few hundred kicks of a laser pulse. They could also run the simulation backwards and scale its size.
""It essentially told us how to correct for its own errors, so that the fingerprint of ideal time-crystalline behavior could be ascertained from finite time observations,"" says Roderich Moessner, a theoretical physicist from the Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems in Germany.
Having ways to model actual time crystals with confidence that they represent a truly unique phase of matter could be invaluable for probing the insane complexities of non-equilibrium quantum physics.
Time crystals promise to be a window into the novel ways that a wide range of complex systems operate, providing insights not just into quantum spaces, but systems as complex as our own brains.
One day a lot of scientists across a range of fields will be in the market for a time crystal. Now there's less of a chance they'll be ripped off.

A new Department of Energy open-access quantum computing testbed is ready for the public. Scientists from Indiana University recently became the first team to begin using Sandia National Laboratories’ Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed, or QSCOUT.
Quantum computers are poised to become major technological drivers over the coming decades. But to get there, scientists need to experiment with quantum machines that relatively few universities or companies have. Now, scientists can use Sandia’s QSCOUT for research that might not be possible at their home institutions, without the cost or restrictions of using a commercial testbed.
“QSCOUT serves a need in the quantum community by giving users the controls to study the machine itself, which aren’t yet available in commercial quantum computing systems. It also saves theorists and scientists from the trouble of building their own machines. We hope to gain new insights into quantum performance and architecture as well as solve problems that require quantum computation,” said Sandia physicist and QSCOUT lead Susan Clark.
She said the new testbed is a rare machine in three ways: first, as a free, open-access testbed; second, as one made with trapped ion technology; and third, as a platform that gives users an uncommon amount of control over their research.
Last month, Sandia began running the testbed’s first user experiment for scientists from Indiana University. Researchers from IBM, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the University of New Mexico and the University of California, Berkeley, have also been selected to begin experiments soon. Their projects range from testing benchmarking techniques to developing algorithms that could someday solve problems in chemistry too complex for normal computers.
Researchers interested in using the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed are invited to sign up for notifications by emailing [email protected]. Sandia expects to select the next round of projects in the spring, subject to change.
Sandia soliciting proposals
Now, Sandia is getting ready for more research proposals. Anyone can submit a proposal to use QSCOUT, and computing time is free thanks to funding from the DOE Office of Science, Advanced Scientific Computing Research program. The next group of projects is expected to be selected in the spring.
On top of providing an exceptional research opportunity, QSCOUT has a rare design for a testbed. Most commercial testbeds use technology called superconducting circuits. Such machines need to be kept at ultralow temperatures, making them expensive to build and operate. But Sandia’s testbed uses what is called an ion trap instead. This means Sandia’s testbed can run at warmer temperatures. Trapped ions also yield clearer signals than circuits and hold on to information longer, enabling scientists to perform different types of experiments and compare the two platforms.
Trapped ions are held inside QSCOUT in a so-called “trap on a chip,” a flat, bow tie-shaped device, about 2 cm (0.8 inches) long, overlaid on a semiconductor chip. Three electrically charged atoms of the element ytterbium are suspended in place by radio waves and an electric field above a hairline channel that runs down the center of the device. Lasers encode information in each ion as a qubit, comparable to a bit in a conventional computer, to perform calculations.
Sandia plans to expand the system from three to 32 qubits over the next three years so scientists can perform more sophisticated tests.
QSCOUT resides at Sandia’s Microsystems Engineering, Science, and Applications complex, which also produces microelectronics for the nation’s nuclear stockpile.",3765,"['gsjhqt5', 'gsjdigh', 'gsjm27b', 'gsjkvuy', 'gsknxa7', 'gsje6xn', 'gsjfich', 'gskuq5b', 'gsk74ld', 'gskw93p', 'gsjph54', 'gsjn03m', 'gskuarw', 'gskzfgy', 'gsjsej9', 'gsjmogy', 'gsjltua', 'gsjvc5e', 'gskfiae', 'gskxdhw', 'gsk6lue', 'gsjnrq3', 'gskkbxm', 'gskvx0x', 'gsl25uc', 'gsl500p', 'gsl8jfc', 'gsl8x6m', 'gsl9xln', 'gslan9i', 'gsldnqc', 'gslecsa', 'gslg4i8', 'gsli3sb', 'gsliddf', 'gslkmti', 'gslkw6v', 'gsln2mf', 'gslphdg', 'gslrmwp', 'gslswit', 'gsm0vh9', 'gsmlk39', 'gsmsmth', 'gsn1dvk', 'gsn5ga9', 'gsnnkvf', 'gsosfkc', 'gsw8w9v', 'gsjqmfx', 'gskmdqu', 'gsjztmh', 'gsk824d', 'gsk8684', 'gskbwsf', 'gskbxwz', 'gskkppu', 'gskrei1', 'gsku64a', 'gsku6eu', 'gskwf9a', 'gsmc9qq']"

Whether it’s photovoltaics or fusion, sooner or later, human civilization must turn to renewable energies. This is deemed inevitable considering the ever-growing energy demands of humanity and the finite nature of fossil fuels. As such, much research has been pursued in order to develop alternative sources of energy, most of which utilize electricity as the main energy carrier. The extensive R&D in renewables has been accompanied by gradual societal changes as the world adopted new products and devices running on renewables. The most striking change as of recently is the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. While they were hardly seen on the roads even 10 years ago, now millions of electric cars are being sold annually. The electric car market is one of the most rapidly growing sectors, and it helped propel Elon Musk to become the wealthiest man in the world.
Unlike traditional cars which derive energy from the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, electric vehicles rely on batteries as the storage medium for their energy. For a long time, batteries had far lower energy density than those offered by hydrocarbons, which resulted in very low ranges of early electric vehicles. However, gradual improvement in battery technologies eventually allowed the drive ranges of electric cars to be within acceptable levels in comparison to gasoline-burning cars. It is no understatement that the improvement in battery storage technology was one of the main technical bottlenecks which had to be solved in order to kickstart the current electric vehicle revolution.
However, despite the vast improvements in battery technology, today consumers of electric vehicles face another difficulty – slow battery charging speed. Currently, cars take about 10 hours to fully recharge at home. Even the fastest superchargers at the charging stations require up to 20-40 minutes to fully recharge the vehicles. This creates additional costs and inconvenience to the customers.
To address this problem, scientists looked for answers in the mysterious field of quantum physics. Their search has led to the discovery that quantum technologies may promise new mechanisms to charge batteries at a faster rate. Such concept of “quantum battery” has been first proposed in a seminal paper published by Alicki and Fannes in 2012. It was theorized that quantum resources, such as entanglement, can be used to vastly speed up the battery charging process by charging all cells within the battery simultaneously in a collective manner.
This is particularly exciting as modern large-capacity batteries can contain numerous cells. Such collective charging is not possible in classical batteries, where the cells are charged in parallel independently of one another. The advantage of this collective versus parallel charging can be measured by the ratio called the ‘quantum charging advantage’. Later, around the year 2017, it was noticed that there can be two possible sources behind this quantum advantage – namely ‘global operation’ (in which all the cells talk to all others simultaneously, i.e., “all sitting at one table”) and ‘all-to-all coupling’ (every cell can talk with every other, but a single cell, i.e., “many discussions, but every discussion has only two participants”). However, it is unclear whether both these sources are necessary and whether there are any limits to the charging speed that can be achieved.
Recently, scientists from the Center for Theoretical Physics of Complex Systems within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) further explored these questions. The paper, which was chosen as an “Editor’s Suggestion” in the journal Physical Review Letters, showed that all-to-all coupling is irrelevant in quantum batteries and that the presence of global operations is the only ingredient in the quantum advantage. The group went further to pinpoint the exact source of this advantage while ruling out any other possibilities and even provided an explicit way of designing such batteries.
In addition, the group was able to precisely quantify how much charging speed can be achieved in this scheme. While the maximum charging speed increases linearly with the number of cells in classical batteries, the study showed that quantum batteries employing global operation can achieve quadratic scaling in charging speed. To illustrate this, we will consider a typical electric vehicle with a battery that contains about 200 cells. Employing this quantum charging would lead to a 200 times speedup over classical batteries, which means that at home charging time would be cut from 10 hours to about 3 minutes. At high-speed charging stations, the charge time would be cut from 30 minutes to mere seconds.
Researchers say that consequences can be far-reaching and that the implications of quantum charging can go well beyond electric cars and consumer electronics. For example, it may find key uses in future fusion power plants, which require large amounts of energy to be charged and discharged in an instant. Of course, quantum technologies are still in their infancy and there is a long way to go before these methods can be implemented in practice. Research findings such as these, however, create a promising direction and can incentivize the funding agencies and businesses to further invest in these technologies. If employed, it is believed that quantum batteries would completely revolutionize the way we use energy and take us a step closer to our sustainable future.

MELVIN was a machine-learning algorithm Krenn had built, a kind of artificial intelligence. Its job was to mix and match the building blocks of standard quantum experiments and find solutions to new problems. And it did find many interesting ones. But there was one that made no sense. “The first thing I thought was, ‘My program has a bug because the solution cannot exist,’” Krenn says.
MELVIN had seemingly solved the problem of creating highly complex entangled states involving multiple photons (entangled states being those that once made Albert Einstein invoke the specter of “spooky action at a distance”). Krenn, Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna and their colleagues had not explicitly provided MELVIN the rules needed to generate such complex states, yet it had found a way. Eventually Krenn realized that the algorithm had rediscovered a type of experimental arrangement that had been devised in the early 1990s. But those experiments had been much simpler. MELVIN had cracked a far more complex puzzle. “When we understood what was going on, we were immediately able to generalize [the solution],” says Krenn, who is now at the University of Toronto.
Since then, other teams have started performing the experiments identified by MELVIN, allowing them to test the conceptual underpinnings of quantum mechanics in new ways. Meanwhile Krenn, working with colleagues in Toronto, has refined their machine-learning algorithms. Their latest effort, an AI called THESEUS, has upped the ante: it is orders of magnitude faster than MELVIN, and humans can readily parse its output. While it would take Krenn and his colleagues days or even weeks to understand MELVIN’s meanderings, they can almost immediately figure out what THESEUS is saying. “It is amazing work,” says theoretical quantum physicist Renato Renner of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, who reviewed a 2020 study about THESEUS but was not directly involved in these efforts.
Krenn stumbled on this entire research program somewhat by accident when he and his colleagues were trying to figure out how to experimentally create quantum states of photons entangled in a very particular manner. When two photons interact, they become entangled, and both can be mathematically described only using a single shared quantum state. If you measure the state of one photon, the measurement instantly fixes the state of the other even if the two are kilometers apart (hence Einstein’s derisive comments on entanglement being “spooky”).
In 1989 three physicists—Daniel Greenberger, the late Michael Horne and Zeilinger—described an entangled state that came to be known as GHZ (after their initials). It involved four photons, each of which could be in a quantum superposition of, say, two states, 0 and 1 (a quantum state called a qubit). In their paper, the GHZ state involved entangling four qubits such that the entire system was in a two-dimensional quantum superposition of states 0000 and 1111. If you measured one of the photons and found it in state 0, the superposition would collapse, and the other photons would also be in state 0. The same went for state 1. In the late 1990s Zeilinger and his colleagues experimentally observed GHZ states using three qubits for the first time.
Krenn and his colleagues were aiming for GHZ states of higher dimensions. They wanted to work with three photons, where each photon had a dimensionality of three, meaning it could be in a superposition of three states: 0, 1 and 2. This quantum state is called a qutrit. The entanglement the team was after was a three-dimensional GHZ state that was a superposition of states 000, 111 and 222. Such states are important ingredients for secure quantum communications and faster quantum computing. In late 2013 the researchers spent weeks designing experiments on blackboards and doing the calculations to see if their setups could generate the required quantum states. But each time they failed. “I thought, ‘This is absolutely insane. Why can’t we come up with a setup?’” Krenn says.
To speed up the process, Krenn first wrote a computer program that took an experimental setup and calculated the output. Then he upgraded the program to allow it to incorporate in its calculations the same building blocks that experimenters use to create and manipulate photons on an optical bench: lasers, nonlinear crystals, beam splitters, phase shifters, holograms, and the like. The program searched through a large space of configurations by randomly mixing and matching the building blocks, performed the calculations and spat out the result. MELVIN was born. “Within a few hours the program found a solution that we scientists—three experimentalists and one theorist—could not come up with for months,” Krenn says. “That was a crazy day. I could not believe that it happened.” Then he gave MELVIN more smarts. Anytime it found a setup that did something useful, MELVIN added that setup to its toolbox. “The algorithm remembers that and tries to reuse it for more complex solutions,” Krenn says.
It was this more evolved MELVIN that left Krenn scratching his head in a Viennese café. He had set it running with an experimental toolbox that contained two crystals, each capable of generating a pair of photons entangled in three dimensions. Krenn’s naive expectation was that MELVIN would find configurations that combined these pairs of photons to create entangled states of at most nine dimensions. But “it actually found one solution, an extremely rare case, that has much higher entanglement than the rest of the states,” Krenn says.
Eventually he figured out that MELVIN had used a technique that multiple teams had developed nearly three decades ago. In 1991 Xin Yu Zou, Li Jun Wang and Leonard Mandel, all then at the University of Rochester, designed one method. And in 1994 Zeilinger, then at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, and his colleagues came up with another. Conceptually these experiments attempted something similar, but the configuration that Zeilinger and his colleagues devised is simpler to understand. It starts with one crystal that generates a pair of photons (A and B). The paths of these photons go right through another crystal, which can also generate two photons (C and D). The paths of photon A from the first crystal and of photon C from the second overlap exactly and lead to the same detector. If that detector clicks, it is impossible to tell whether the photon originated from the first or the second crystal. The same goes for photons B and D.
A phase shifter is a device that effectively increases the path a photon travels as some fraction of its wavelength. If you were to introduce a phase shifter in one of the paths between the crystals and kept changing the amount of phase shift, you could cause constructive and destructive interference at the detectors. For example, each of the crystals could be generating, say, 1,000 pairs of photons per second. With constructive interference, the detectors would register 4,000 pairs of photons per second. And with destructive interference, they would detect none: the system as a whole would not create any photons even though individual crystals would be generating 1,000 pairs a second. “That is actually quite crazy, when you think about it,” Krenn says.
MELVIN’s funky solution involved such overlapping paths. What had flummoxed Krenn was that the algorithm had only two crystals in its toolbox. And instead of using those crystals at the beginning of the experimental setup, it had wedged them inside an interferometer (a device that splits the path of, say, a photon into two and then recombines them). After much effort, he realized that the setup MELVIN had found was equivalent to one involving more than two crystals, each generating pairs of photons, such that their paths to the detectors overlapped. The configuration could be used to generate high-dimensional entangled states.
Quantum physicist Nora Tischler, who was a Ph.D. student working with Zeilinger on an unrelated topic when MELVIN was being put through its paces, was paying attention to these developments. “It was kind of clear from the beginning [that such an] experiment wouldn’t exist if it hadn’t been discovered by an algorithm,” she says.
Besides generating complex entangled states, the setup using more than two crystals with overlapping paths can be employed to perform a generalized form of Zeilinger’s 1994 quantum interference experiments with two crystals. Aephraim Steinberg, an experimentalist who is a Toronto colleague of Krenn’s but has not worked on these projects, is impressed by what the AI found. “This is a generalization that (to my knowledge) no human dreamed up in the intervening decades and might never have done,” he says. “It’s a gorgeous first example of the kind of new explorations these thinking machines can take us on.”
In one such generalized configuration with four crystals, each generating a pair of photons, and overlapping paths leading to four detectors, quantum interference can create situations where either all four detectors click (constructive interference) or none of them do so (destructive interference). Until recently, carrying out such an experiment had remained a distant dream. Then, in a March preprint paper, a team led by Lan-Tian Feng of the University of Science and Technology of China, in collaboration with Krenn, reported that they had fabricated the entire setup on a single photonic chip and performed the experiment. The researchers collected data for more than 16 hours: a feat made possible because of the photonic chip’s incredible optical stability, something that would have been impossible to achieve in a larger-scale tabletop experiment. For starters, the setup would require a square meter’s worth of optical elements precisely aligned on an optical bench, Steinberg says. Besides, “a single optical element jittering or drifting by a thousandth of the diameter of a human hair during those 16 hours could be enough to wash out the effect,” he says.
During their early attempts to simplify and generalize what MELVIN had found, Krenn and his colleagues realized that the solution resembled abstract mathematical forms called graphs, which contain vertices and edges and are used to depict pairwise relations between objects. For these quantum experiments, every path a photon takes is represented by a vertex. And a crystal, for example, is represented by an edge connecting two vertices. MELVIN first produced such a graph and then performed a mathematical operation on it. The operation, called perfect matching, involves generating an equivalent graph in which each vertex is connected to only one edge. This process makes calculating the final quantum state much easier, although it is still hard for humans to understand.
That changed with MELVIN’s successor THESEUS, which generates much simpler graphs by winnowing the first complex graph representing a solution that it finds down to the bare minimum number of edges and vertices (such that any further deletion destroys the setup’s ability to generate the desired quantum states). Such graphs are simpler than MELVIN’s perfect matching graphs, so it is even easier to make sense of any AI-generated solution. Renner is particularly impressed by THESEUS’s human-interpretable outputs. “The solution is designed in such a way that the number of connections in the graph is minimized,” he says. “And that’s naturally a solution we can better understand than if you had a very complex graph.”
Eric Cavalcanti of Griffith University in Australia is both impressed by the work and circumspect about it. “These machine-learning techniques represent an interesting development. For a human scientist looking at the data and interpreting it, some of the solutions may look like ‘creative’ new solutions. But at this stage, these algorithms are still far from a level where it could be said that they are having truly new ideas or coming up with new concepts,” he says. “On the other hand, I do think that one day they will get there. So these are baby steps—but we have to start somewhere.” Steinberg agrees. “For now they are just amazing tools,” he says. “And like all the best tools, they’re already enabling us to do some things we probably wouldn’t have done without them.”",12546,"['h5ihsxb', 'h5izlh6', 'h5iqucb', 'h5jcpxy', 'h5j1yw9', 'h5jak2u', 'h5iy74h', 'h5iyrhr', 'h5j9gaw', 'h5kmwwv', 'h5kornf', 'h5l5b2w', 'h5nqibl', 'h5hvv3x', 'h5iu29h', 'h5iz60z', 'h5j03lh', 'h5jnupx', 'h5k0bkz', 'h5k3rdh', 'h5kfi74', 'h5l3bbu']"

A Rice University-led study is forcing physicists to rethink superconductivity in uranium ditelluride, an A-list material in the worldwide race to create fault-tolerant quantum computers.
Uranium ditelluride crystals are believed to host a rare “spin-triplet” form of superconductivity, but puzzling experimental results published this week in Nature have upended the leading explanation of how the state of matter could arise in the material. Neutron-scattering experiments by physicists from Rice, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the University of California, San Diego and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University revealed telltale signs of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations that were coupled to superconductivity in uranium ditelluride.
Spin-triplet superconductivity has not been observed in a solid-state material, but physicists have long suspected it arises from an ordered state that is ferromagnetic. The race to find spin-triplet materials has heated up in recent years due to their potential for hosting elusive quasiparticles called Majorana fermions that could be used to make error-free quantum computers.
“People have spent billions of dollars trying to search for them,” Rice study co-author Pengcheng Dai said of Majorana fermions, hypothetical quasiparticles that could be used to make topological quantum bits free from the problematic decoherence that plagues qubits in today’s quantum computers.
“The promise is that if you have a spin-triplet superconductor, it can potentially be used to make topological qubits,” said Dai, a professor of physics and astronomy and member of the Rice Quantum Initiative. “You can’t do that with spin-singlet superconductors. So, that’s why people are extremely interested in this.”
Superconductivity happens when electrons form pairs and move as one, like couples spinning across a dance floor. Electrons naturally loathe one another, but their tendency to avoid other electrons can be overcome by their inherent desire for a low-energy existence. If pairing allows electrons to achieve a more sloth-like state than they could achieve on their own — something that’s only possible at extremely cold temperatures — they can be coaxed into pairs.
The coaxing comes in the form of fluctuations in their physical environment. In normal superconductors, like lead, the fluctuations are vibrations in the atomic lattice of lead atoms inside the superconducting wire. Physicists have yet to identify the fluctuations that bring about unconventional superconductivity in materials like uranium ditelluride. But decades of study have found phase changes — watershed moments where electrons spontaneously rearrange themselves — at the critical points where pairing begins.
In the equations of quantum mechanics, these spontaneous ordered arrangements are represented by terms known as order parameters. The name spin triplet refers to the spontaneous breakdown of three symmetries in these ordered arrangements. For example, electrons spin constantly, like tiny bar magnets. One order parameter relates to their spin axis (think north pole), which points up or down. Ferromagnetic order is when all spins point the same direction, and antiferromagnetic order is when they alternate in an up-down, up-down arrangement. In the only confirmed spin-triplet, superfluid helium-3, the order parameter has no fewer than 18 components.
“All other superconductivity is spin singlet,” said Dai, who’s also a member of Rice’s Center for Quantum Materials (RCQM). “In a spin singlet, you have one spin up and one spin down, and if you put a magnetic field on, it can easily destroy superconductivity.”
That’s because the magnetic field pushes spins to align in the same direction. The stronger the field, the stronger the push.
“The problem with uranium ditelluride is the field required to destroy superconductivity is 40 Tesla,” Dai said. “That’s huge. For 40 years, people thought the only possibility for that to occur is that when you put a field on, the spins are already aligned in one direction, meaning it’s a ferromagnet.”
In the study, Dai and Rice postdoctoral research associate Chunruo Duan, the study’s lead author, worked with Florida State co-author Ryan Baumbach, whose lab grew the single crystal samples of uranium ditelluride used in the experiment, and UC San Diego co-author Brian Maple, whose lab tested and prepared the samples for neutron-scattering experiments at Oak Ridge’s Spallation Neutron Source.
“What the neutron does is come in with a particular energy and momentum, and it can flip the Cooper pair spins from an up-up state to an up-down state,” Dai said. “It tells you how the pairs are formed. From this neutron spin resonance, one can basically determine the electron pairing energy” and other telltale properties of the quantum mechanical wave function that describes the pair, he said.
Dai said there are two possible explanations for the result: either uranium ditelluride is not a spin-triplet superconductor, or spin-triplet superconductivity arises from antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in a way that physicists haven’t previously imagined. Dai said decades of experimental evidence points to the latter, but this appears to violate conventional wisdom about superconductivity. So Dai teamed up with Rice colleague Qimiao Si, a theoretical physicist who specializes in emergent quantum phenomena like unconventional superconductivity.
Si, a study co-author, has spent much of the past five years showing a theory of multiorbital pairing he co-developed with former Ph.D. student Emilian Nica explains contradictory experimental findings in several kinds of unconventional superconductors, including heavy fermions, the class that includes uranium ditelluride.
In multiorbital pairing, electrons in some atomic shells are more likely to form pairs than others. Si recalled thinking that uranium had the potential to contribute paired electrons from any of seven orbitals with 14 possible states.
“Multiorbitals was the first thing that came to mind,” he said. “It wouldn’t be possible if you only had one band or one orbital, but orbitals bring a new dimension to possible unconventional superconductor pairings. They’re like a palette of colors. The colors are the internal quantum numbers, and the f electrons in the uranium-based, heavy-fermion materials are naturally set up to have these colors. They lead to new possibilities that go beyond the ‘periodic table of pairing states.’ One of these new possibilities turns out to be spin-triplet pairing.”
Si and Nica, who’s now at Arizona State University, showed antiferromagnetic correlations could give rise to plausible, low-energy, spin-triplet pairing states.
“Spin-triplet pairing states are highly improbable in the vast majority of cases because pairs will form as spin-singlets in order to lower their energy,” Si said. “In uranium ditelluride, spin-orbit coupling can change the energy landscape in a way that makes spin-triplet pairing states more competitive with their spin-singlet counterparts.”

A photonic quantum computer, which harnesses particles of light, or photons, performed a calculation that’s impossible for a conventional computer, researchers in China report online December 3 in Science. That milestone, known as quantum supremacy, has been met only once before, in 2019 by Google’s quantum computer (SN: 10/23/19). Google’s computer, however, is based on superconducting materials, not photons.
“This is the first independent confirmation of Google’s claim that you really can achieve quantum supremacy,” says theoretical computer scientist Scott Aaronson of the University of Texas at Austin. “That’s exciting.”
Named Jiuzhang after an ancient Chinese mathematical text, the new quantum computer can perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would take more than half a billion years on the world’s fastest non-quantum, or classical, computer.
“My first impression was, ‘wow,’” says quantum physicist Fabio Sciarrino of Sapienza University of Rome.
Google’s device, called Sycamore, is based on tiny quantum bits made of superconducting materials, which conduct energy without resistance. In contrast, Jiuzhang consists of a complex array of optical devices that shuttle photons around. Those devices include light sources, hundreds of beam splitters, dozens of mirrors and 100 photon detectors.
Employing a process called boson sampling, Jiuzhang generates a distribution of numbers that is exceedingly difficult for a classical computer to replicate. Here’s how it works: Photons are first sent into a network of channels. There, each photon encounters a series of beam splitters, each of which sends the photon down two paths simultaneously, in what’s called a quantum superposition. Paths also merge together, and the repeated splitting and merging causes the photons to interfere with one another according to quantum rules.
Finally, the number of photons in each of the network’s output channels is measured at the end. When repeated many times, this process produces a distribution of numbers based on how many photons were found in each output.
If operated with large numbers of photons and many channels, the quantum computer will produce a distribution of numbers that is too complex for a classical computer to calculate. In the new experiment, up to 76 photons traversed a network of 100 channels. For one of the world’s most powerful classical computers, the Chinese supercomputer Sunway TaihuLight, predicting the results that the quantum computer would get for anything beyond about 40 photons was intractable.
While Google was the first to break the quantum supremacy barrier, the milestone is “not a single-shot achievement,” says study coauthor and quantum physicist Chao-Yang Lu of the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. “It’s a continuous competition between constantly improved quantum hardware and constantly improved classical simulation.” After Google’s quantum supremacy claim, for example, IBM proposed a type of calculation that might allow a supercomputer to perform the task Google’s computer completed, at least theoretically.

And achieving quantum supremacy doesn’t necessarily indicate that the quantum computers are yet very useful, because the calculations are esoteric ones designed to be difficult for classical computers.
The result does boost the profile of photonic quantum computers, which haven’t always received as much attention as other technologies, says quantum physicist Christian Weedbrook, CEO of Xanadu, a Toronto-based company focused on building photonic quantum computers. “Historically, photonics has been the dark horse.”
One limitation of Jiuzhang, Weedbrook notes, is that it can perform only a single type of task, namely, boson sampling. In contrast, Google’s quantum computer could be programmed to execute a variety of algorithms. But other types of photonic quantum computers, including Xanadu’s, are programmable.
Demonstrating quantum supremacy with a different type of device reveals how rapidly quantum computing is progressing, Sciarrino says. “The fact that now the two different platforms are able to achieve this regime … shows that the whole field is advancing in a very mature way.”",4383,"['geu41ci', 'geufgcd', 'geuc51n', 'geuir23', 'geube39', 'geuk7dy', 'gewfbjq', 'gewl196', 'gew9mzz', 'geuk04a']"
26,zloibj,posted_link,https://www.space.com/quantum-time-flipped-photon-first-time,Tao_Dragon,1671017138.0,'Quantum time flip' makes light move simultaneously forward and backward in time,,2022-12-13,Ben Turner,'Quantum time flip' makes light move simultaneously forward and backward in time,"For the first time, physicists have made light appear to move simultaneously forward and backward in time. The new technique could help scientists improve quantum computing and understand quantum gravity.
By splitting a photon, or packet of light, using a special optical crystal, two independent teams of physicists have achieved what they describe as a ""quantum time flip,"" in which a photon exists in both forward and backward time states.
The effect results from the convergence of two strange principles of quantum mechanics (opens in new tab), the counterintuitive rules that govern the behavior of the very small. The first principle, quantum superposition, enables minuscule particles to exist in many different states, or different versions of themselves, at once, until they are observed. The second — charge, parity and time-reversal (CPT) symmetry — states that any system containing particles will obey the same physical laws even if the particles' charges, spatial coordinates and movements through time are flipped as if through a mirror.
By combining these two principles, the physicists produced a photon that appeared to simultaneously travel along and against the arrow of time. They published the results of their twin experiments Oct. 31 (opens in new tab) and Nov. 2 (opens in new tab) on the preprint server arXiv, meaning the findings have yet to be peer-reviewed.
""The concept of the arrow of time is giving a word to the apparent unidirectionality of time that we observe in the macroscopic world we inhabit,"" Teodor Strömberg (opens in new tab), a physicist at the University of Vienna who was first author on one of the papers, told Live Science. ""This is actually in tension with many of the fundamental laws of physics, which by and large are time symmetric, and which therefore do not have a preferred time direction.""
The second law of thermodynamics (opens in new tab) states that the entropy of a system, a rough analogue of its disorder, must increase. Known as the ""arrow of time,"" entropy is one of the few quantities in physics that sets time to go in a particular direction.
This tendency for disorder to grow in the universe explains why it's easier to mix ingredients than to separate them. It's also through this growing disorder that entropy is wedded so intimately to our sense of time. A famous scene in Kurt Vonnegut's novel ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" demonstrates how differently entropy makes one direction of time look to the other by playing World War II in reverse: Bullets are sucked from wounded men; fires are shrunk, gathered into bombs, stacked in neat rows, and separated into composite minerals; and the reversed arrow of time undoes the disorder and devastation of war.
However, as entropy is primarily a statistical concept, it doesn’t apply to single subatomic particles. In fact, in every particle interaction scientists have observed so far — including the up to 1 billion interactions per second that take place inside the world's largest atom smasher, the Large Hadron Collider — CPT symmetry is upheld. So particles seeming to move forward in time are indistinguishable from those in a mirrored system of antiparticles moving backward in time. (Antimatter was created with matter during the Big Bang and doesn't actually move backward in time; it just behaves as if it is following an opposite arrow of time to normal matter.)
The other factor at play in the new experiments is superposition. The most famous demonstration of quantum superposition is Schrödinger's cat, a thought experiment in which a cat is placed inside a sealed box with a vial of poison whose release is triggered by the radioactive decay of an alpha particle. Radioactive decay is a quantum mechanical process that occurs at random, so it is initially impossible to know what happened to the cat, which is in a superposition of states, simultaneously dead and alive, until the box is opened and the outcome observed.
This superposition of states enables a particle to exist in both forward and backward time states at the same time, but witnessing this feat experimentally is tricky. To achieve it, both teams devised similar experiments to split a photon along a superposition of two separate paths through a crystal. The superposed photon moved on one path through the crystal as normal, but another path was configured to change the photon's polarization, or where it points in space, to move as if it were traveling backward in time.

After recombining the superposed photons by sending them through another crystal, the team measured the photon polarization across a number of repeated experiments. They found a quantum interference pattern, a pattern of light and dark stripes that could exist only if the photon had been split and was moving in both time directions.
""The superposition of processes we realized is more akin to an object spinning clockwise and counter-clockwise at the same time,"" Strömberg said. The researchers created their time-flipped photon out of intellectual curiosity, but follow-up experiments showed that time flips can be paired with reversible logic gates to enable simultaneous computation in either direction, thus opening the way for quantum processors with greatly enhanced processing power.
Theoretical possibilities also sprout from the work. A future theory of quantum gravity, which would unite general relativity and quantum mechanics, should include particles of mixed time orientations like the one in this experiment, and could enable the researchers to peer into some of the universe's most mysterious phenomena.

The enhanced contactless card uses standards recently revealed by finance industry technical body EMVCo known as “the EMV Contactless Kernel Specifications” that work with all existing payment terminals while also providing higher levels of security that are also “future proof”.
When quantum computing technology reaches a point known as quantum supremacy, where the machines can perform near errorless calculations impossible with classical computers, it will also render current cryptography solutions simple to crack, meaning specific quantum security will be required. Experts expect this point to be reached by 2025-2027.
Mastercard says its new card is a “significant milestone that brings quantum-era security and privacy protection to contactless payments”. It will come with next-generation algorithms and cryptographic keys that have been designed to be fast, ensuring a contactless payment happens in under half a second, according to payment vendor, along with enhanced privacy protections to reduce the amount of account information shared between the consumer device and merchant terminal.
There are predicted to be more than 12.5 billion contactless payment devices in active use by 2027 and transactions made using these devices will top $10trn globally.
“Technology has the potential to open new opportunities for both consumers and fraudsters,” said Ajay Bhalla, president for cyber and intelligence at Mastercard. “That’s why future-proofing security is critical.”
Wider roll-out of quantum Mastercards in 2023
Mastercard says it expects to begin the transition to these new cards at pace in 2023, providing the specifications for various card manufacturers. The goal, says Bhalla is to ensure “a seamless transition from today’s contactless experience” as quantum computers take hold.
Key features of the new specifications include a secure channel for privacy, eavesdropping prevention and protection of sensitive data from man-in-the-middle and relay attacks. It also includes elliptic curve cryptography for authentication and support for biometric and mobile verification methods.
Mastercard says it has also developed the specifications in partnership with EMVCo to ensure they are optimised for cloud operations and potential on-card data storage so that privacy and integrity protection can be on the cloud and not remote.
Earlier this year the US government issued a requirement for government departments to begin adopting quantum-resistant cryptography and NIST, the Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology has selected four quantum cryptography algorithms that will form part of a new set of cryptography standards.
These new global cryptography standards are likely to be used by companies and governments as they begin to plan their transition to quantum readiness.
“We knew quantum computers could break public key cryptography since 1995,” said Dr Ali El Kaafarani, PQShield founder and CEO told Tech Monitor earlier this year. “The NSA and governments didn’t take action until 2015 because that is when the technology advanced enough to start to need to find alternatives to RSA. This was the start of the standardisation project.”
He added: “We don’t know when we are going to have a quantum computer. People say 10-15 years but nobody can give you proof it won’t come earlier. Also, will someone actually tell you if they build it earlier? Especially if they have malicious intent?”
The other issue, Dr El Kaafarani said, is that it will likely take a long time to gradually switch to quantum cryptography. “This makes it an urgent matter you need to start now,” he said.",3860,"['itzn6id', 'itzk33m', 'iu05joj', 'itzz6o4', 'itz5eti', 'itzyzxr', 'itzxjx6', 'iu9l4pn', 'iub03r2', 'iu02jx7', 'iu18cyz', 'iu0th0l']"

The new technique could help scientists improve quantum computing and understand quantum gravity.
By splitting a photon, or packet of light, using a special optical crystal, two independent teams of physicists have achieved what they describe as a ""quantum time flip,"" in which a photon exists in both forward and backward time states.
The effect results from the convergence of two strange principles of quantum mechanics (opens in new tab), the counterintuitive rules that govern the behavior of the very small. The first principle, quantum superposition, enables minuscule particles to exist in many different states, or different versions of themselves, at once, until they are observed. The second — charge, parity and time-reversal (CPT) symmetry — states that any system containing particles will obey the same physical laws even if the particles' charges, spatial coordinates and movements through time are flipped as if through a mirror.
By combining these two principles, the physicists produced a photon that appeared to simultaneously travel along and against the arrow of time. They published the results of their twin experiments Oct. 31 (opens in new tab) and Nov. 2 (opens in new tab) on the preprint server arXiv, meaning the findings have yet to be peer-reviewed.
""The concept of the arrow of time is giving a word to the apparent unidirectionality of time that we observe in the macroscopic world we inhabit,"" Teodor Strömberg (opens in new tab), a physicist at the University of Vienna who was first author on one of the papers, told Live Science. ""This is actually in tension with many of the fundamental laws of physics, which by and large are time symmetric, and which therefore do not have a preferred time direction.""
The second law of thermodynamics (opens in new tab) states that the entropy of a system, a rough analogue of its disorder, must increase. Known as the ""arrow of time,"" entropy is one of the few quantities in physics that sets time to go in a particular direction.
This tendency for disorder to grow in the universe explains why it's easier to mix ingredients than to separate them. It's also through this growing disorder that entropy is wedded so intimately to our sense of time. A famous scene in Kurt Vonnegut's novel ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" demonstrates how differently entropy makes one direction of time look to the other by playing World War II in reverse: Bullets are sucked from wounded men; fires are shrunk, gathered into bombs, stacked in neat rows, and separated into composite minerals; and the reversed arrow of time undoes the disorder and devastation of war.
However, as entropy is primarily a statistical concept, it doesn’t apply to single subatomic particles. In fact, in every particle interaction scientists have observed so far — including the up to 1 billion interactions per second that take place inside the world's largest atom smasher, the Large Hadron Collider — CPT symmetry is upheld. So particles seeming to move forward in time are indistinguishable from those in a mirrored system of antiparticles moving backward in time. (Antimatter was created with matter during the Big Bang and doesn't actually move backward in time; it just behaves as if it is following an opposite arrow of time to normal matter.)
The other factor at play in the new experiments is superposition. The most famous demonstration of quantum superposition is Schrödinger's cat, a thought experiment in which a cat is placed inside a sealed box with a vial of poison whose release is triggered by the radioactive decay of an alpha particle. Radioactive decay is a quantum mechanical process that occurs at random, so it is initially impossible to know what happened to the cat, which is in a superposition of states, simultaneously dead and alive, until the box is opened and the outcome observed.
This superposition of states enables a particle to exist in both forward and backward time states at the same time, but witnessing this feat experimentally is tricky. To achieve it, both teams devised similar experiments to split a photon along a superposition of two separate paths through a crystal. The superposed photon moved on one path through the crystal as normal, but another path was configured to change the photon's polarization, or where it points in space, to move as if it were traveling backward in time.

Knowing you've got yourself an authentic time crystal takes more than a keen eye for high-quality gems.
In a new study, an international team of researchers used Google's Sycamore quantum computing hardware to double-check their theoretical vision of a time crystal, confirming it ticks all of the right boxes for an emerging form of technology we're still getting our head around.
Similar to conventional crystals made of endlessly repeating units of atoms, a time crystal is an infinitely repeating change in a system, one that remarkably doesn't require energy to enter or leave.
Though such a thing comes close to breaking certain laws of thermodynamics, the fact that the system's entropy doesn't increase means it should sit on the right side of physics.
In reality, such a crystal might look like an oscillation of some sort that doesn't synchronize with the rest of the system's rhythms. A laser tapping out a steady beat on your time crystal, for example, might make its particles' spins flip only on every other tap.
But the sheer complexity of a huge number of interacting quantum objects all swinging to their own rhythm leaves some wiggle room for explanations that aren't necessarily dependent on the same rules that underpin time crystal physics.
So while unlikely, we can't rule out that a system that initially looks like a time crystal might in reality warm up over the eons and eventually fall into disarray.
You could just sit and watch your crystal hum away until the eventual heat death of the Universe, of course. Or you could let a quantum computer carry out the job for you.
""The big picture is that we are taking the devices that are meant to be the quantum computers of the future and thinking of them as complex quantum systems in their own right,"" says Stanford University physicist Matteo Ippoliti.
""Instead of computation, we're putting the computer to work as a new experimental platform to realize and detect new phases of matter.""
The starting place for this particular time crystal was a surprisingly unintentional one, emerging from work conducted by Stanford theoretical physicist Vedika Khemani on non-equilibrium physics.
We're intimately familiar with the consequences of this kind of physics in everyday life. Leave your hot cup of coffee out on the bench for half an hour, and you'll discover how quickly its heat energy dissipates as it sits out of equilibrium with its environment.
Khemani and her colleagues were more interested in the imbalance of energy on the far less intuitive level of quantum physics.
It was only when a reviewer of Khemani's research drew her attention to similarities between her own work and time crystals that she turned her focus to this exciting new field of physics.
""Time-crystals are a striking example of a new type of non-equilibrium quantum phase of matter,"" says Khemani.
""While much of our understanding of condensed matter physics is based on equilibrium systems, these new quantum devices are providing us a fascinating window into new non-equilibrium regimes in many-body physics.""
Modelling their time crystal on Google's quantum technology allowed the team to look for signs of infinite repetition within just a few hundred kicks of a laser pulse. They could also run the simulation backwards and scale its size.
""It essentially told us how to correct for its own errors, so that the fingerprint of ideal time-crystalline behavior could be ascertained from finite time observations,"" says Roderich Moessner, a theoretical physicist from the Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems in Germany.
Having ways to model actual time crystals with confidence that they represent a truly unique phase of matter could be invaluable for probing the insane complexities of non-equilibrium quantum physics.
Time crystals promise to be a window into the novel ways that a wide range of complex systems operate, providing insights not just into quantum spaces, but systems as complex as our own brains.
One day a lot of scientists across a range of fields will be in the market for a time crystal. Now there's less of a chance they'll be ripped off.

According to the application, AMD is researching a system that aims to use quantum teleportation to increase a quantum system's reliability, while simultaneously reducing the number of qubits necessary for a given calculation. The aim is to both alleviate scaling problems and calculation errors stemming from system instability.
There are two major hurdles on the road to quantum development and eventual quantum supremacy: scalability and stability. Quantum states are a fickle matter, so sensitive that they can decohere at the slightest provocation -- and a quantum system's sensitivity tends to increase with the presence of more qubits in a given system.
The AMD patent, titled ""Look Ahead Teleportation for Reliable Computation in Multi-SIMD Quantum Processor,"" aims to improve quantum stability, scalability, and performance in novel, more efficient ways. It describes a quantum architecture based on quantum processing regions: areas of the chip that hold or can hold qubits, lying in wait for their turn on the processing pipeline. AMD's approach aims to improve on existing quantum architectures by actually reducing the number of qubits needed to perform complex calculations -- via the science fiction-esque concept of quantum teleportation.
AMD's design aims to teleport qubits across regions, enabling workloads that would theoretically require in-order execution to become capable of being processed in an out-of-order philosophy. As a quick refresher, in-order execution features dependencies between one instruction and the next, meaning that a workload has to be processed sequentially, with later steps dependent on the previous step being fully processed and its result being known before the chip can move ahead with the computation.
As you may imagine, there are chip resources (in this case, qubits) that sit idle until it's their time to perform the next calculation step. On the other hand, Out-of-order execution analyzes a given workload, figures out which parts of it are dependent on previous results and which are not, and executes every step of the instruction that doesn't require a previous result, thus improving performance via increased parallelism.
AMD's patent also includes a look-ahead processor embedded into the architecture,
tasked to analyze the input workload, predict what steps can be tackled in parallel (and those that can't), and appropriately distribute the workload across qubits, using a quantum teleporting technique to deliver them to the required quantum processing, SIMD-based region.
How this quantum teleportation occurs isn't described in the patent -- it looks like AMD is playing its cards close to its chest on this one. Perhaps we're looking at the beginning of AMD's ""Zen 98"" design (that's a joke, to be clear), or maybe this will not materialize in an actual product. But it does show, beyond any doubt and surprising no one, that AMD is indeed working on quantum computing. That seems to be the next great computing race. And while AMD may or may not be backing the right horse to ride toward an eventual victory, at least it seems the company does plan to be a part of the race.",3372,"['hbbbw4n', 'hbbmmhm', 'hbc1x16', 'hbbxziw', 'hbc7al7', 'hbcpngs', 'hbdx7mh', 'hbb7ba5', 'hbbwa8n', 'hbc5fvj', 'hbdorx1', 'hbedm9p', 'hbg8h3y', 'hbbcfjc', 'hbbd9o9', 'hbc1h5p', 'hbcag5s', 'hbcbhpi', 'hbcfgtk', 'hbcrvos', 'hbdiu9a', 'hbdqscg', 'hbdwd4c', 'hbe1f5f', 'hbed358', 'hbeua44', 'hbezb64', 'hbfbmxx', 'hbfgepp', 'hbfpxi1', 'hbfr83l', 'hbfx9fu', 'hbgtn3r', 'hbblyct', 'hbbfdfb', 'hbblihw', 'hbbttfe', 'hbcmsel']"

The company's first-generation Phoenix system can pack as many as 100 qubits that are said to be 'exceptionally' stable with long coherence times, thus providing extreme performance potential. Separately, the company announced that it had secured over $15 million in Series A funding and hired a new CEO.
Atom Computing's Phoenix can trap 100 atomic qubits (of an alkaline earth element) in a vacuum chamber with optical tweezers. Then, the quantum states of atomic qubits are manipulated with lasers. The company claims that its qubits are remarkably stable and have very long coherence times (i.e., over 100 ms), making Atom Computing's Phoenix suitable for complex computations.
Using atomic qubits in a vacuum chamber with optical tweezers is not something particularly new. Honeywell makes such systems commercially, yet its quantum computers only have six qubits. Atom Computing says that its laser technologies and platform architecture allow scaling the number of qubits all the way to 100 units. However, the company yet has to showcase such a system.
""Quantum computing has accelerated to a point where it is no longer 10 years out. The scalability and stability of our systems gives us confidence that we will be able to lead the industry to true quantum advantage,"" said Rob Hays, CEO and President, Atom Computing. ""We will be able to solve complex problems that have not been practical to address with classical computing, even with the exponential performance gains of Moore’s Law and massively-scalable cluster architectures.""
In addition to revealing the first details about its Phoenix quantum computing system, Atom Computing said that it had secured $15 million in Series A funding from venture capital firms Venrock, Innovation Endeavors, and Prelude Ventures. The money will be spent on building the Phoenix quantum computer system.
Also, the company appointed Rob Hays to the CEO and President position. Previously Hays served for 20 years at Intel, developing the company's Xeon roadmap. Later on, he worked at Lenovo, where he developed the company's strategy for data center products and services.",2241,"['h6ghfyc', 'h6hbksu', 'h6gy3f6', 'h6i7piq', 'h6huz67', 'h6g83rd']"

IBM is releasing Qiskit Machine Learning, a set of new application modules that’s part of its open source quantum software. The new feature is the latest expansion of the company’s broader effort to get more developers to begin experimenting with quantum computers.
According to a blog post by the Qiskit Applications Team, the machine learning modules promise to help optimize machine learning by using quantum computers for some parts of the process.
“Quantum computation offers another potential avenue to increase the power of machine learning models, and the corresponding literature is growing at an incredible pace,” the team wrote. “Quantum machine learning (QML) proposes new types of models that leverage quantum computers’ unique capabilities to, for example, work in exponentially higher-dimensional feature spaces to improve the accuracy of models.”
Rather than replacing current computer architectures, IBM is betting that quantum computers will gain traction in the coming years by taking on very specific tasks that are offloaded from a classic computing system to a quantum platform. AI and machine learning are among the areas where IBM has said it’s hopeful that quantum can make an impact.

To make quantum more accessible, last year IBM introduced an open source quantum programming framework called Qiskit. The company has said it has the potential to speed up some applications by 100 times.
In the case of machine learning, the hope is that a system that offloads tasks to a quantum system could accelerate the training time. However, challenges remain, such as how to get large data sets in and out of the quantum machine without adding time that would cancel out any gains by the quantum calculations.
Developers who use Qiskit to improve their algorithms will have access to test them on IBM’s cloud-based quantum computing platform.

Together with researchers from Google, the scientists set out to measure the speed of simulation in one of D-Wave's quantum annealing processors, and found that performance increased with both simulation size and problem difficulty, to reach a million-fold speedup over what could be achieved with a classical CPU.
The calculation that D-Wave and Google's teams tackled is a real-world problem; in fact, it has already been resolved by the 2016 winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics, Vadim Berezinskii, J. Michael Kosterlitz and David Thouless, who studied the behavior of so-called ""exotic magnetism"", which occurs in quantum magnetic systems.
The Nobel Prize winners used advanced mathematical methods to describe, in the 1970s, the properties of a two-dimensional quantum magnet, which shed light on the strange – or ""exotic"" – states that matter can take on.
Instead of proving quantum supremacy, which happens when a quantum computer runs a calculation that is impossible to resolve with classical means, D-Wave's latest research demonstrates that the company's quantum annealing processors can lead to a computational performance advantage.
""This work is the clearest evidence yet that quantum effects provide a computational advantage in D-Wave processors,"" said Andrew King, director of performance research at D-Wave.
D-Wave's processors are based on quantum annealing technology, which is a quantum computing technique used to find solutions to optimization problems. While some argue that the scope of the problems that can be resolved by the technology is limited, quantum annealing processors are easier to control and operate than their gate-based equivalents, which is why D-Wave's technology has already reached much higher numbers of qubits than can be found in the devices built by big players like IBM or Google.
To simulate exotic magnetism, King and his team used the D-Wave 2,000-qubit system, which was recently revised to reduce noise, to model a programmable quantum magnetic system, just like Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless did in the 1970s to observe the unusual states of matter. The researchers also programmed a standard classical algorithm for this kind of simulation, called a ""path-integral Monte Carlo"" (PIMC), to compare the quantum results with CPU-run calculations. As the numbers show, the quantum simulation outperformed classical methods by a margin.
""What we see is a huge benefit in absolute terms,"" said King. ""This simulation is a real problem that scientists have already attacked using the algorithms we compared against, marking a significant milestone and an important foundation for future development. This wouldn't have been possible today without D-Wave's lower noise processor.""
Equally as significant as the performance milestone, said D-Wave's team, is the fact that the quantum annealing processors were used to run a practical application, instead of a proof-of-concept or an engineered, synthetic problem with little real-world relevance. Until now, quantum methods have mostly been leveraged to prove that the technology has the potential to solve practical problems, and is yet to make tangible marks in the real world.
In contrast, D-Wave's latest experiment resolved a meaningful problem that scientists are interested in independent of quantum computing. The findings have already attracted the attention of scientists around the world.
""The search for quantum advantage in computations is becoming increasingly lively because there are special problems where genuine progress is being made. These problems may appear somewhat contrived even to physicists,"" said Gabriel Aeppli, professor of physics at ETH Zürich and EPF Lausanne.
""But in this paper from a collaboration between D-Wave Systems, Google, and Simon Fraser University, it appears that there is an advantage for quantum annealing using a special purpose processor over classical simulations for the more 'practical' problem of finding the equilibrium state of a particular quantum magnet.""
D-Wave, however, stayed clear of claiming quantum advantage, which happens when a quantum processor can demonstrate superiority over all possible classical competition; King stressed that it is still possible to design highly specialized algorithms to simulate the model once the properties of the model are already known.
The real significance of the experiment lies in the proof that a computational advantage can already be achieved using existing quantum methods to solve a valuable materials science problem.
""These experiments are an important advance in the field, providing the best look yet at the inner workings of D-Wave computers, and showing a scaling advantage over its chief classical competition,"" said King. ""All quantum computing platforms will have to pass this kind of checkpoint on the way to widespread adoption.""

Working from the company's R&D lab in Cambridge in the UK, the scientists demonstrated that they could transmit quantum bits (or qubits) over hundreds of kilometers of optical fiber without scrambling the fragile quantum data encoded in the particles, thanks to a new technology that stabilizes the environmental fluctuations occurring in the fiber.
This could go a long way in helping to create a next-generation quantum internet that scientists hope will one day span global distances.
The quantum internet, which will take the shape of a global network of quantum devices connected by long-distance quantum communication links, is expected to enable use-cases that are impossible with today's web applications. They range from generating virtually un-hackable communications, to creating clusters of inter-connected quantum devices that together could surpass the compute power of classical devices.

But in order to communicate, quantum devices need to send and receive qubits – tiny particles that exist in a special, but extremely fragile, quantum state. Finding the best way to transmit qubits without having them fall from their quantum state has got scientists around the world scratching their heads for many years.
One approach consists of shooting qubits down optical fibers that connect quantum devices. The method has been successful but is limited in scale: small changes in the environment, such as temperature fluctuations, cause the fibers to expand and contract, and risk messing with the qubits.
This is why experiments with optical fiber, until now, have typically been limited to a range of hundreds of kilometers; in other words, nowhere near enough to create the large-scale, global quantum internet dreamed up by scientists.
To tackle the instable conditions inside optical fibers, Toshiba's researchers developed a new technique called ""dual band stabilization"". The method sends two signals down the optical fiber at different wavelengths. The first wavelength is used to cancel out rapidly varying fluctuations, while the second wavelength, which is at the same wavelength as the qubits, is used for finer adjustments of the phase.
Put simply, the two wavelengths combine to cancel environmental fluctuations inside the fiber in real time, which according to Toshiba's researchers, enabled qubits to travel safely over 600 kilometers.
Already, the company's team has used the technology to trial one of the most well-known applications of quantum networks: quantum-based encryption.
Known as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), the protocol leverages quantum networks to create security keys that are impossible to hack, meaning that users can securely exchange confidential information, like bank statements or health records, over an untrusted communication channel such as the internet.
During a communication, QKD works by having one of the two parties encrypt a piece of data by encoding the cryptography key onto qubits and sending those qubits over to the other person thanks to a quantum network. Because of the laws of quantum mechanics, however, it is impossible for a spy to intercept the qubits without leaving a sign of eavesdropping that can be seen by the users – who, in turn, can take steps to protect the information.
Unlike classical cryptography, therefore, QKD does not rely on the mathematical complexity of solving security keys, but rather leverages the laws of physics. This means that even the most powerful computers would be unable to hack the qubits-based keys. It is easy to see why the idea is gathering the attention of players from all parts, ranging from financial institutions to intelligence agencies.
Toshiba's new technique to reduce fluctuations in optical fibers enabled the researchers to carry out QKD over a much larger distance than previously possible. ""This is a very exciting result,"" said Mirko Pittaluga, research scientist at Toshiba Europe. ""With the new techniques we have developed, further extensions of the communication distance for QKD are still possible and our solutions can also be applied to other quantum communications protocols and applications.""
When it comes to carrying out QKD using optical fiber, Toshiba's 600-kilometer mark is a record-breaker, which the company predicts will enable secure links to be created between cities like London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Dublin.
Other research groups, however, have focused on different methods to transmit qubits, which have enabled QKD to happen over even larger distances. Chinese scientists, for example, are using a mix of satellite-based transmissions communicating with optical fibers on the ground, and recently succeeded in carrying out QKD over a total distance of 4,600 kilometers.
Every approach has its pros and cons: using satellite technologies is more costly and could be harder to scale up. But one thing is certain: research groups in the UK, China and the US are experimenting at pace to make quantum networks become a reality.
Toshiba's research was partially funded by the EU, which is showing a keen interest in developing quantum communications. Meanwhile, China's latest five-year plan also allocates a special place for quantum networks; and the US recently published a blueprint laying out a step-by-step guide leading to the establishment of a global quantum internet.",5683,"['h1inyll', 'h1ij80w', 'h1ibap2', 'h1jcj85', 'h1imgkp', 'h1izyex', 'h1ixhnv', 'h1j6r68', 'h1jpq2u', 'h1jrpbi', 'h1irnoy', 'h1is8nf', 'h1isl26', 'h1ivlc6', 'h1izsxg', 'h1j4pzq', 'h1jas4h', 'h1jm9dd', 'h1jrrwq', 'h1jscax', 'h1jsd0s', 'h1jzeme', 'h1k1fow', 'h1klvao', 'h1kqsyy', 'h1krkq0', 'h1kwbjg', 'h1kxgzv', 'h1kz2oe', 'h1l2xwh', 'h1l5cex', 'h1l5ww9', 'h1l6nyd', 'h1l7o6v', 'h1lmpw4', 'h1lqcba', 'h1lumqq', 'h1mdsl1', 'h1mheg8', 'h1mulfr', 'h1myn0r', 'h1n343g', 'h1nl09i']"

A team led by Dr. Eunjoo Jang, a Samsung fellow, and Dr. Yu-Ho Won, a principal researcher at Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, improved the structure of the quantum dot made out of environmentally-friendly indium phosphide.
Their proposed structure prevents oxidation of the core and builds a symmetrical and thick shell around it to prevent energy leaks. The ligand on the shell surface has also been made shorter to allow it to absorb electric current faster.
Quantum efficiency improves by 21.4% and the lifetime of the diodes increased to a million hours, the South Korean tech giant said.
The company added that it has over 170 patents on element structure in QLEDs and will continue to develop new technology to lead in advanced displays.
A Samsung spokesman declined to comment on when the company will commercialise self-emissive QLED technology.
STILL A DISTANT FUTURE
Despite Samsung's announcement, the commercialisation of displays that uses quantum dot (QD) as the light source is still far away, and may never be realised at all as there are mountain of challenges ahead.
Research into using QD has focused on avoiding cadmium, which is the best material to use as a light source thanks to its malleability and integrity, but is harmful to humans.
Materials such as indium phosphide have so far failed to match the performance of cadmium when used as the direct light source in actual practice.
Samsung's current flagship TVs are called QLED, which does use QD that are cadmium-free. But they do not use QD as the light sources absorbs electricity directly. Rather, QD is used as a film on Liquid Crystal Display that emits luminance by absorbing the light from the backlight.
The production of the first iteration of this will begin in 2021, but will be QD-enabled OLED, which uses organic material as the light source and QD material as a film. It will be more similar to Samsung's own AMOLED used for mobile phones and LG's OLED TVs.
If Samsung's eventual goal is to launch a self-emissive QLED display, at minimum, the industry will have to wait until 2025 to see if it is indeed viable.
The aggressive investment plan is Samsung Display's attempt to diversify its portfolio amid slowing smartphone growth and the rise of China, with the company set to begin production of 65-inch QD displays in 2021.",2557,"['f8yyn20', 'f8z214p', 'f8zj33m', 'f8zq65w', 'f8zsnxw', 'f90n5xt', 'f90uqeg', 'f919wu8', 'f91ik8p', 'f92m7k4', 'f9315qr', 'f93biy3', 'f90gz13']"
