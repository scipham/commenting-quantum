Researchers claim quantum breakthrough
Giant leap Researchers say they have designed a tiny crystal that acts like a quantum computer so powerful it would take a computer the size of the known universe to match it.
Details of the crystal, which is made up of just 300 atoms, are published today in the journal Nature.
""Quantum computing is a kind of information science that is based on the notion that if one performs computations in a fundamentally different way than the way your classical desktop computer works,"" says study co-author University of Sydney's Dr Michael Biercuk.
""There's a huge potential to solve a variety of problems that are very, very hard or near impossible for standard computer.""
The crystal simulator uses a property of quantum mechanics called superposition, where a quantum particle appears to be in two distinct states at the same time. This means the particle, known as a qubit, can be used to solve two equations simultaneously.
As the number of qubits increase, the number or states increases exponentially. For example, 2 qubits can simultaneously be in 4 states, 3 qubits in 8 states: 2 to the power of n states for n qubits.
Outstrips classical computers
According to Biercuk, the computing power of the 300-atom crystal simulator far outstrips the capacity of today's classical computer.
""It turns out that that computer would need to be the size of the known universe - which is clearly something that's not possible to achieve,"" he says.
Experts believe quantum computing is moving to a stage where it is so far out in front and performing such complex tasks it will be difficult to check if it is working accurately.
""They're not easily checked by a classical computer which opens a whole variety of problems,"" says Biercuk.
And he adds that there is still plenty of work to be done before quantum computers start appearing on desks in homes and offices.
""The central element is something like a millimetre in diameter, 300 atoms that are suspended in space,"" says Biercuk.
""But of course everything depends on a huge amount of technical infrastructure around it. There are vacuum chambers and pumps and lasers, and all of that takes up something like a room.""",2209,"['c4gv34x', 'c4gv5cx', 'c4guxrs', 'c4gwoqy', 'c4gvo87', 'c4gyj0g', 'c4gy9ot', 'c4gxpde', 'c4gvy5s', 'c4gzgja', 'c4gy487', 'c4h61oz', 'c4gusam', 'c4gwbuo', 'c4gvhq4', 'c4gwmdz', 'c4gymtg', 'c4gytdo', 'c4gzlol', 'c4gznko', 'c4gy13l', 'c4gy46p', 'c4gydk1', 'c4gyf3z', 'c4gygj1', 'c4gyk46', 'c4gym1v', 'c4gyqdu', 'c4gyxyr', 'c4gyypp', 'c4gz36l', 'c4gzob7', 'c4gzpww', 'c4gzu7r', 'c4gzylh', 'c4h06o7', 'c4h0xfb', 'c4h0z12', 'c4h10al', 'c4h12nz', 'c4h1bwj', 'c4h2tez', 'c4gyrov', 'c4gxpfv', 'c4gxiw4', 'c4gzdxy', 'c4gwnaw', 'c4gwnp8', 'c4gwxmc', 'c4gx5z4', 'c4gxipu', 'c4gxjbl', 'c4gy6cu', 'c4gy6h6', 'c4gy7t8', 'c4gy99k', 'c4gyofv', 'c4gypfs', 'c4gypvc', 'c4gysbn', 'c4gz068', 'c4gz11n', 'c4gz3ds', 'c4gz3q0', 'c4gz4cm', 'c4gz4e9', 'c4gz4kx', 'c4gz5vk', 'c4gz64u', 'c4gz6dm', 'c4gz8f5', 'c4gz9h4', 'c4gzad6', 'c4gzagx', 'c4gzb69', 'c4gzc0o', 'c4gze7y', 'c4gzgb1', 'c4gzh1v', 'c4gzk14', 'c4gzlps', 'c4gzn7p', 'c4gzoz4', 'c4gzpnt', 'c4gzvbd', 'c4gzvjj', 'c4gzwu3', 'c4gzx1v', 'c4gzycv', 'c4h00xc', 'c4h04ah', 'c4h04my', 'c4h08dd', 'c4h09wl', 'c4h0ao0', 'c4h0fa4', 'c4h0gaf', 'c4h0h8q', 'c4h0i3k', 'c4h0kwx', 'c4h0l5b', 'c4h0mpf', 'c4h0njd', 'c4h0o96', 'c4h0obq', 'c4h0pom', 'c4h0v95', 'c4h0v9w', 'c4h0x6a', 'c4h0yu0', 'c4h10x2', 'c4h11h0', 'c4h13eo', 'c4h1c5q', 'c4h1ouf', 'c4h1oyv', 'c4h1sif', 'c4h1vhx', 'c4h1vxh', 'c4h1y5w', 'c4h20jv', 'c4h2hyj', 'c4h56ia', 'c4h8qjx', 'c4hbfv7', 'c4hh05o', 'c4gv405', 'c4h01oq', 'c4guwvi', 'c4gwgve', 'c4gwxwe', 'c4gxzb8', 'c4gymjn', 'c4h153v', 'c4gwmzp', 'c4gvacg', 'c4gyi0e', 'c4gyi7x', 'c4h15yx', 'c4gvzqj', 'c4gx9oq', 'c4gxkha', 'c4gy79s', 'c4h0m0v', 'c4h19xo', 'c4h1d9i', 'c4h1imu', 'c4h1l0g', 'c4hal5p', 'c4gvrs6', 'c4gwihl', 'c4gx5p6', 'c4gxe8u', 'c4gyxt3', 'c4h17n7', 'c4gvjxx', 'c4gvpug', 'c4gvtgi', 'c4gvwt3', 'c4gw1o8', 'c4gxrpt', 'c4gv84x']"

No word on pricing just yet, but I wouldn't expect much change from $15 million—the cost of a non-universal D-Wave quantum computer.
In other news, IBM has also opened up an API (sample code available on Github) that gives developers easier access to the five-qubit quantum computer currently connected to the IBM cloud. Later in the year IBM will release a full SDK, further simplifying the process of building quantum software.
You can't actually do much useful computation with five qubits, mind you, but fortunately IBM also has news there: the company's quantum simulator can now simulate up to 20 qubits. The idea is that developers should start thinking about potential 20-qubit quantum scenarios now, so they're ready to be deployed when IBM builds the actual hardware.
Speaking of hardware, it seems IBM has accelerated its universal quantum computing roadmap somewhat. In May last year IBM said it would like to build a 50-qubit computer ""in the next decade."" Now we're down to ""the next few years.""
IBM has also fleshed out its quantum computing roadmap a little, providing some guidance on how it will actually build a universal 50-qubit computer:
IBM’s roadmap to scale to practical quantum computers is based on a holistic approach to advancing all parts of the system. IBM will leverage its deep expertise in superconducting qubits, complex high performance system integration, and scalable nanofabrication processes from the semiconductor industry to help advance the quantum mechanical capabilities.
Despite the aggressive roadmap, however, there is no evidence that any scaling has, in fact, occurred. Recal the original publication, which involved nine computational qubits, and a total of 1000 qubits. Now IBM wants their quantum computer to be fully interconnected, so 50 computational qubits requires 1,225 connections. Each link seems to require 48 qubits for control, so 58,800 qubits. This is quite a jump for 1000 qubits on a board.
Comparing to D-Wave, which also produces boards with around 1000 qubits, they always end up with one or two non-functional qubits. In this case, it is most likely that a non-functional qubit will be in the connection between two computational qubits, rendering not one, but two nodes useless.
We'll be a lot more confident in IBM's scaling when we see actual papers with increasing numbers of computational qubits.
Other than D-Wave, IBM doesn't have much competition in the quantum computing space—and as we've explained in the past, both companies appear to be approaching quantum computing quite differently. IBM has set its sights on building a true universal quantum computer, which can be used to solve any quantum algorithm under the sun. D-Wave seems more focused on scaling up the number of qubits and ensuring its system can integrate easily with classical computers, but not ensuring its qubits are actually qubits.
While exact pricing, availability, and specs are still a long way off, it's fairly safe to assume that IBM's quantum computers will be about the same price as a D-Wave (~$15 million) or perhaps a little dearer. Both systems are fundamentally the same thing: a fancy chip inside a box that contains a multi-stage dilution refrigerator from a company like BlueFors.
Dilution refrigerators take about 24 hours to cool down, but they can then keep the chip at close-to-absolute-zero (~5mK, -273.145°C)—a prerequisite for current quantum computing chips—almost indefinitely.
And finally, a random factoid: the photo on the right shows me standing on a ladder next to one of IBM's dilution refrigerators at IBM Research headquarters in upstate New York back in 2013.

FINALLY. No more lag in my starcraft games.,,2010-05-19,Casey Johnston,Quantum teleportation achieved over ten miles of free space,"Quantum teleportation has achieved a new milestone or, should we say, a new ten-milestone: scientists have recently had success teleporting information between photons over a free space distance of nearly ten miles, an unprecedented length. The researchers who have accomplished this feat note that this brings us closer to communicating information without needing a traditional signal, and that the ten miles they have reached could span the distance between the surface of the earth and space.
As we've explained before, ""quantum teleportation"" is quite different from how many people imagine teleportation to work. Rather than picking one thing up and placing it somewhere else, quantum teleportation involves entangling two things, like photons or ions, so their states are dependent on one another and each can be affected by the measurement of the other's state.
When one of the items is sent a distance away, entanglement ensures that changing the state of one causes the other to change as well, allowing the teleportation of quantum information, if not matter. However, the distance particles can be from each other has been limited so far to a number of meters.
Teleportation over distances of a few hundred meters has previously only been accomplished with the photons traveling in fiber channels to help preserve their state. In this particular experiment, researchers maximally entangled two photons using both spatial and polarization modes and sent the one with higher energy through a ten-mile-long free space channel. They found that the distant photon was still able to respond to changes in state of the photon they held onto even at this unprecedented distance.
However, the long-distance teleportation of a photon is only a small step towards developing applications for the procedure. While photons are good at transmitting information, they are not as good as ions at allowing manipulation, an advancement we'd need for encryption. Researchers were also able to maintain the fidelity of the long-distance teleportation at 89 percent— decent enough for information, but still dangerous for the whole-body human teleportation that we're all looking forward to.",2182,"['c0qbpqr', 'c0qbts4', 'c0qbluy', 'c0qbqne', 'c0qbuio', 'c0qbk0g', 'c0qbzof', 'c0qbo34', 'c0qbuy1', 'c0qbxsj', 'c0qbr7a', 'c0qbltg', 'c0qbpmz', 'c0qbvlu', 'c0qbnox', 'c0qbjft', 'c0qc5x2', 'c0qc9og', 'c0qcycr', 'c0qbtb9', 'c0qbzia', 'c0qc0tg', 'c0qccuo', 'c0qcena', 'c0qcn1s', 'c0qdd5z', 'c0qdhja', 'c0qdp76', 'c0qerna', 'c0qj3nc', 'c0qbkii', 'c0qc6tl', 'c0qcfcm', 'c0qbz06', 'c0qbzht', 'c0qc8sh', 'c0qcbto', 'c0qbyj2', 'c0qbo05', 'c0qbpqr', 'c0qbts4', 'c0qbluy', 'c0qbqne', 'c0qbuio', 'c0qbk0g', 'c0qbzof', 'c0qbo34', 'c0qbuy1', 'c0qbxsj', 'c0qbr7a', 'c0qbltg', 'c0qbpmz', 'c0qbvlu', 'c0qbnox', 'c0qbjft', 'c0qc5x2', 'c0qc9og', 'c0qcycr', 'c0qbtb9', 'c0qbzia', 'c0qc0tg', 'c0qccuo', 'c0qcena', 'c0qcn1s', 'c0qdd5z', 'c0qdhja', 'c0qdp76', 'c0qerna', 'c0qj3nc', 'c0qbkii', 'c0qc6tl', 'c0qcfcm', 'c0qbz06', 'c0qbzht', 'c0qc8sh', 'c0qcbto', 'c0qbyj2', 'c0qbo05']"

Recently, Google and NASA received the latest D-Wave 2X quantum computer, which the company says has ""over 1000 qubits.""
At an event yesterday at the NASA Ames Research Center, where the D-Wave computer is kept, Google and NASA announced their latest findings—and for highly specialised workloads, quantum annealing does appear to offer a truly sensational performance boost. For an optimisation problem involving 945 binary variables, the D-Wave X2 is up to 100 million times faster (108) than the same problem running on a single-core classical (conventional) computer.
Google and NASA also compared the D-Wave X2's quantum annealing against Quantum Monte Carlo, an algorithm that emulates quantum tunnelling on a conventional computer. Again, a speed-up of up to 108 was seen in some cases.
Hartmut Neven, the head of Google's Quantum Artificial Intelligence lab, said these results are ""intriguing and very encouraging"" but that there's still ""more work ahead to turn quantum enhanced optimization into a practical technology.""
As always, it's important to note that D-Wave's computers are not capable of universal computing: they are only useful for a small number of very specific tasks—and Google, NASA, and others are currently trying to work out what those tasks might be. D-Wave’s claim of ""over 1,000 qubits"" is also unclear. In the past, several physical qubits were clustered to create a single computational qubit, and D-Wave doesn’t make that distinction clear.

Take a piece of material that blocks light and cut two small slits in it; hit the slits with a flood of photons, and they'll interfere with each other as they exit the far side, creating a pattern of peaks and valleys corresponding to where the wavelengths of the photons interfered constructively and destructively. Do the same thing, but send the photons at the slits one at a time, and you still see the same pattern. In effect, the photon flows through both slits as a probability wave, and these probabilities interfere with each other.
Stranger still, the same behavior can be observed with particles. In many circumstances, an electron will behave as a simple, easy-to-quantify particle. But it will also act as a probability wave when confronted with a double slit.
It's a great example, but it also raises a question that's obvious only after you've heard it asked: what happens if there's more than two slits? Is there a limit to how many probabilities a single particle can adopt as it flows through the quantum realm? A paper that will be released by Science today provides a pretty clear answer: two, just as quantum mechanics have suspected. That deceptively simple answer, however, has major implications for our attempts to combine quantum mechanics and gravity into a unified theory of everything.
And, in fact, the new paper explains this rather nicely in the first few sentences of the abstract:
Quantum mechanics and gravitation are two pillars of modern physics. Despite their success in describing the physical world around us, they seem to be incompatible theories. There are suggestions that one of these theories must be generalized to achieve unification.
Apparently, one of the options for generalizing quantum mechanics would be to allow violations of Born's Rule, an axiom that dictates that quantum interference can only occur between pairs of probabilities. Higher order interference could potentially allow a reformulation of quantum mechanics that is compatible with, or even incorporates, gravitation. The authors helpfully point out that actually testing Born's Rule could be rather helpful for theoreticians, given that, if it proves to be an actual rule, then the theoreticians would have one less option to worry about when it comes to describing the Universe.
So, the authors built a triple-slit system, set up so that they could open and close each of the slits. One of the three ended up not opening fully, which actually created a small source of error in the experiments. The fact that the photodetectors at the far end didn't have perfect performance added another source. In the end, however, the authors calculated that the total errors in the system allowed it to be accurate down to one percent, a fairly rigorous test of Born's Rule.
To get their photons, they used two different light sources: a laser with the power turned down so that it only emitted one photon at a time, and a source of quantum light called heralded single photons. With everything in place, they started firing photons off one at a time, until 30 million of them had hit the detector.
By closing off different slits before starting a measurement, they were able to measure the interference probabilities of each of the potential combinations, and then compare them to the pattern seen when all three slits were open. As Born's Rule predicts, the three-slit interference pattern was a complex mixture of the pairwise interference of different slits, but no higher-order interference was present that involved all three slits.
Quantum mechanics remains secure, at least to the one percent error of the experimental setup. With better hardware or alternate experimental setups, the authors suggest, we could narrow that down even further.
That may be bad news for the theoreticians, but it's good news for quantum mechanics, given that the authors ominously suggest that, should Born's Rule be violated, ""then Schrödinger’s equation would likely have to be modified as well.""",4115,"['c0uz2os', 'c0uyb8k', 'c0uz48a', 'c0uz2pl', 'c0uz6oa', 'c0uyfjs', 'c0uyper', 'c0uy1vm', 'c0uzwhc', 'c0uy1np', 'c0uz5ho', 'c0uz2os', 'c0uyb8k', 'c0uz48a', 'c0uz2pl', 'c0uz6oa', 'c0uyfjs', 'c0uyper', 'c0uy1vm', 'c0uzwhc', 'c0uy1np', 'c0uz5ho']"

Qubits teleported at kilobits per second
Teleport entanglement For the first time, researchers have teleported 10,000 bits of information per second inside a solid state circuit.
Although the accomplishment differs from teleporting mass - such as that seen on science fiction shows like Star Trek - the remarkable feat demonstrates what could be possible with a quantum computer.
In their experiment, the team spaced three micron-sized electronic circuits on a seven-by-seven-millimetre computer chip. Two of the circuits worked as a sending mechanism, while the other served as the receiver. The scientists cooled the chip to near absolute zero and ran a current through the circuits.
At that frigid temperature and small scale, the electrons in the circuit - known as quantum bits or qubits - started to behave according to the rules of quantum mechanics. The qubits became entangled. This means they become linked, sharing identical quantum states, even if physically separated from one other. Specifically, the qubits in the sender circuit became entangled with those in the receiving circuit.
The ETH team encoded some information into the qubits in the sending circuits and then measured of the state of the qubits in the receiver circuit.
Whatever state the qubits had been in the sender was reflected instantly in the receiving circuit - the researchers had teleported the information.
This is different from the way information is sent in ordinary computers, electrons carry information along wires or through the air via radio waves. In this case, no bit of data physically travelled along a route - instead the information disappeared from one location and reappeared at another.
Other experimenters have teleported quantum bits, too, and have done so across a larger distance. But those teams only got the teleportation to work once in a while, perhaps a few per cent of the time.
The ETH team was also able to teleport up to 10,000 quantum bits every second, and get it to work right consistently. That's fast enough and accurate enough to build a useful computer.
""Basically we can push a button and have this teleportation work every time,"" says Andreas Wallraff, Professor at the Department of Physics and head of the study.",2248,"['cbqvhuw', 'cbr3mlw', 'cbqw4nj', 'cbqvnn5', 'cbqvn3p', 'cbr9gb3', 'cbqyg3n']"

That turned out to not be entirely correct, since Google had neglected to consider the storage available to supercomputers; if that were included, the quantum computer's lead shrank to just a matter of days.
Adding just a handful of additional qubits, however, would re-establish the quantum computer's vast lead. Recently, however, a draft manuscript was placed on the arXiv that points out a critical fact: Google's claims relied on comparisons to a very specific approach to performing the calculation on standard computing hardware. There are other ways to perform the calculation, and the paper suggests one of those would allow a supercomputer to actually pull ahead of its quantum competitor.
More than one road to random
The calculation Google performed was specifically designed to be difficult to simulate on a normal computer. It set the 54 qubits of its Sycamore processor in a random state, then let quantum interference among neighboring qubits influence how the system evolves over time. After a short interval, the hardware started repeatedly measuring the state of the qubits. Each individual measurement produced a string of random bits, making Sycamore into a very expensive random-number generator. But if enough measurements are made, certain patterns generated by the quantum interference become apparent.
Because the rules of this quantum interference are understood, it's also possible to calculate the patterns we should see in the random numbers generated by Sycamore. But doing those calculations is very computationally expensive and gets more expensive with each additional qubit in the system. Google estimated that it would take an unrealistically long time to perform these calculations on the world's most advanced supercomputers.
The one flaw with this argument that was pointed out early in the process was that Google neglected to consider the storage attached to the world's then-largest supercomputer, which would significantly cut into Sycamore's lead. But the reality remained that these computations were very difficult for classical computing hardware.
The new manuscript focuses on a key aspect of that phrase: these computations. Google chose a very specific method of computing the expected behavior of its processor, but there are other ways of doing equivalent computations. Over the intervening time, a few options have been explored that do perform better. Now, Feng Pan, Keyang Chen, and Pan Zhang are describing a specific method that allows a GPU-based cluster to produce an equivalent output in only 15 hours. Run it on a leading supercomputer, and they estimate that it would outperform the Sycamore quantum processor.
Some light-on-math descriptions
There are several ways to look at what Pan, Chen, and Zhang accomplished. We'll try three of them, getting progressively deeper into the math as we go along.
The simplest way of viewing this is in terms of the output that Sycamore provided. Individual measurements of the state of the qubits in the Sycamore processor produced a string of truly random ones and zeros, but patterns would become apparent if you ran enough measurements of a single initial state of the processor. If you set up a classical calculation that recapitulates the physics of Sycamore, you would get the same level of randomness and the same patterns.
What the new paper describes is a way to trade off some of the fidelity of the calculated reconstruction of the processor's behavior but gain much faster calculations in the process. In other words, the new calculations don't exactly recapitulate the behavior of Sycamore, but they still produce the patterns and the underlying randomness, and they can be completed much faster.
That's explanation one. Option No. 2 for understanding this involves considering how the starting state of the Sycamore processor evolves into its state at the point of measurement. Multiple possible paths will get there and, this being a quantum system, it explores all of them. To get an exact model of the Sycamore processor's output, you'd also have to explore all the paths, which is very computationally intensive. Pan, Chen, and Zhang found a means of limiting the paths you look at that makes the calculations tractable while still achieving an equivalent output.
Those of you who want to avoid math should now skip to the next section header. The actual calculation method describes the interactions of Sycamore's qubits as a three-dimensional tensor network, with the tensors dictating the relationships among the properties of the qubits. The algorithm then simplifies this down by severing some of the network's connections—the researchers describe this as doing the equivalent of drilling three-dimensional holes through the network.
Each hole you drill cuts the fidelity of its calculations in half. But that makes the fidelity completely adjustable: you can ensure you have a sufficient recapitulation of Sycamore's behavior simply by limiting the number of holes you drill. The mathematics of where those holes were drilled within the network were dictated by the physical structure of the Sycamore chip itself.

The version of the browser coming out today has a sleek new interface and, under the hood, major performance enhancements, with Mozilla claiming that it's as much as twice as fast as it was a year ago. Not only should it be faster to load and render pages, but its user interface should remain quick and responsive even under heavy load with hundreds of tabs.Collectively, the performance work being done to modernize Firefox is called Project Quantum. We took a closer look at Quantum back when Firefox 57 hit the developer channel in September, but the short version is, Mozilla is rebuilding core parts of the browser, such as how it handles CSS stylesheets, how it draws pages on-screen, and how it uses the GPU.
This work is being motivated by a few things. First, the Web has changed since many parts of Firefox were initially designed and developed; pages are more dynamic in structure and applications are richer and more graphically intensive. JavaScript is also more complex and difficult to debug. Second, computers now have many cores and simultaneous threads, giving them much greater scope to work in parallel. And security remains a pressing concern, prompting the use of new techniques to protect against exploitation. Some of the rebuilt portions are even using Mozilla's new Rust programming language, which is designed to offer improved security compared to C++.
While today's release represents a major step forward in the browser's performance and reliability, work on Quantum continues. One major weakness of Firefox, relative to Chrome and Edge, is its use of sandboxing and process isolation to limit the impact that security flaws can have. Next year Mozilla will be working to improve these areas. Early next year should also see the rollout of a new GPU-accelerated rendering engine.",1955,"['dpt06e3', 'dpt3j55', 'dpuekho', 'dpt511y', 'dr64nor', 'dr8bd5h', 'dptk9mw', 'dptk2uv', 'dptmm03', 'dpwboab', 'dr0vca0', 'dr9c2pi', 'dr9c4hk', 'drr2r2k', 'drwp5f2', 'drxw7b5', 'drurura']"

Two or more particles can interact in a specific ways that leave them entangled, such that a later measurement on one system identifies what the outcome of a similar measurement on the second system—no matter how far they are separated in space.
Repeated experiments have verified that this works even when the measurements are performed more quickly than light could travel between the sites of measurement: there's no slower-than-light influence that can pass between the entangled particles. However, one possible explanation for entanglement would allow for a faster-than-light exchange from one particle to the other. Odd as it might seem, this still doesn't violate relativity, since the only thing exchanged is the internal quantum state—no external information is passed.
But a new analysis by J-D. Bancal, S. Pironio, A. Acín, Y-C. Liang, V. Scarani, and N. Gisin shows that any such explanation would inevitably open the door to faster-than-light communication. In other words, quantum entanglement cannot involve the passage of information—even hidden, internal information, inaccessible to experiment—at any velocity, without also allowing for other types of interactions that violate relativity.
Experiments have definitively demonstrated entanglement, and ruled out any kind of slower-than-light communication between two separated objects. The standard explanation for this behavior involves what's called nonlocality: the idea that the two objects are actually still a single quantum system, even though they may be far apart. That idea is uncomfortable to many people (including most famously Albert Einstein), but it preserves the principle of relativity, which states in part that no information can travel faster than light.
To get around nonlocality, several ideas have been proposed over the decades. Many of these fall into the category of hidden variables, wherein quantum systems have physical properties (beyond the standard quantities like position, momentum, and spin) that are not directly accessible to experiment. In entangled systems, the hidden variables could be responsible for transferring state information from one particle to the other, producing measurements that appear coordinated. Since these hidden variables are not accessible to experimenters, they can't be used for communication. Relativity is preserved.
Hidden variable theories involving slower-than-light transfer of state information are already ruled out by the experiments that exclude more ordinary communication. Some modern variations combine hidden variables with full nonlocality, allowing for instantaneous transfer of internal state information. But could non-instantaneous, faster-than-light hidden variables theories still work?
To investigate this possibility, the authors of the new study considered the possible experimental consequences. Obviously, one way to test it would be to increase the separation between the parts of the entangled system to see if we can detect a delay in apparently instantaneous correlation we currently observe. Sufficiently fast rates of transfer, however, would still be indistinguishable from nonlocality, given that real lab measurements take finite time to perform (this assumes that both experiments happen on Earth).
The researchers took a theoretical approach instead, using something known as the no-signalling conditions. They considered an entangled system with a set of independent physical attributes, some observable, some hidden variables. Next, they allowed the state of the hidden variables to propagate faster than the speed of light, which let them influence the measurements on the separated pieces of the experiment.
However, because of the nature of quantum mechanical systems, there was a symmetry between the hidden and measurable attributes of the system—meaning if the hidden variables could transfer information faster than light, then the properties we can measure would do so as well. This is a violation of the no-signalling condition, and causes serious problems for the ordinary interpretations of quantum physics.
Of course, one conceivable conclusion would be that faster-than-light communication is possible; this result provided a possible avenue for testing that possibility. By restricting the bounds on the speed of interaction between entangled systems, future experiments could show whether any actual information is traveling or not.
However, the far more likely option is that relativity is correct. In that case, the strong ban on faster-than-light communication would rule out the possibility of faster-than-light transfer of information encoded in hidden variables, and force us to deal with nonlocality. Once again, it would seem that local realism and relativity are incompatible notions in the quantum world.",4901,"['c6u0lpx', 'c6u5b2d', 'c6u1rla', 'c6u76xn', 'c6u8k7x', 'c6u0kgx']"

You might be worried that you can tear up your passwords and throw away your encryption, for all is now lost. However, it's probably a bit early to call time on the world as we know it. You see, the whole computer is just five bits.
This might sound like some kind of publicity stunt; maybe it's IBM's way of clawing some attention back from D-Wave's quantum computing efforts. But a careful look shows that serious science undergirds the announcement.
The IBM system is, on a very superficial level, similar to D-Wave's. Both systems use superconducting quantum interference devices as qubits (quantum bits). But the similarity ends there. As IBM emphasizes, its quantum computer is a universal quantum computer—which D-Wave's is not.
Another big difference: IBM can address and measure the state of each qubit individually. The company can measure (and has) all the critical features of its device. If you want to know how long a qubit retains its state, IBM can tell you. IBM even shows that addressing multiple qubits in a random way doesn't affect the state of the others too badly. Big Blue is really building its quantum computer from the foundation up, while still ensuring that the engineering fits real-world requirements.
And we know a fair bit about the hardware. In 2015, IBM released a detailed schematic of how the circuit is put together and how it is linked to the outside world. The schematic probably isn't detailed enough for me to build the circuit in my local cleanroom, but I bet my friends down the hall who work in the field can. Releasing this sort of detail is what we in the industry call ""doing science.""
I was lucky enough to get hold of a draft of the paper about the device. The key focus of the hardware at the moment is not on computing (which is pointless with five qubits) but on ensuring that the device computes reliably thanks to good error correction.
Let me get my red pen
Modern memory and communications systems would not function without error correction. The essential idea is to build some redundancy into the data so that you can always tell when data is corrupted and sometimes correct the problems without having to ask for information to be resent.
A common scheme in classical communications is to take a group of bits, say four, and perform a series of mathematical operations (typically exclusive-or operations) on them to produce a single bit of extra data (note that I'm not outlining an exact scheme here, so in detail the exact numbers change slightly). All five bits are sent to the receiver, which performs exactly the same operations.
One can always tell if there is an error in any of the four data bits based on whether the operations produce the same value for the fifth bit. Because of the way the sequence of operations is structured, somewhere between one and two errors can be corrected based on the outcome of the operations. Basically, at a cost of about a quarter of your communication channel's capacity, you can ensure that almost no uncorrectable errors are received.
There are, of course, a whole bunch of implementation details beyond the math that you have to consider to make this work. But it does work. When I briefly worked in the microwave link industry, with error correction turned off, we expected one bit in a billion to be wrong; with error correction on, it was expected to be better than one bit per trillion.
However, this is for classical communications and computation. The quantum world, as usual, is a whole different story.
For quantum error correction, you need a quantum red pen
So, in addition to a bit-flip error, you can also have a phase-flip error, which is an error in the relationship between two bits, rather than an error in the value of one particular bit.
Quantum computing has a problem with error correction—a far worse one than classical computing faces. Let's put it in perspective. One option for a qubit is a superconducting quantum interference device where the typical energy difference between a one and a zero is on the order of 10-24 joules. For a classical system, we can choose whatever energy difference we want by setting thresholds for voltages and/or currents, so we set it to something convenient, usually something on the order of a volt.
To come close to having the same 10-24J difference between a one and zero, any chip would have to operate with a gate voltage of ten microvolts. So, at minimum, classical and quantum computers operate at energy scales that are different from one another by about a factor of 10,000.
Making matters worse, a qubit state is not a one or a zero but is a probability to produce a one or a zero on measurement, and this probability evolves in time. I can take two qubits that are set identically and then measure them some time later. After repeating this many times, I should find that the probability distributions are the same. That's the theory; in practice, they experience slightly different environments, so at some point later in time, one will have slightly changed relative to the other in an unpredictable way.
So, in addition to a bit-flip error, you can also have a phase-flip error, which is an error in the relationship between two bits rather than an error in the value of one particular bit.
And this makes error correction for a quantum circuit very difficult—and very, very necessary. In classical computers, the first processors could be implemented with minimal (or no) error correction. Quantum computing will require sophisticated error correction from the get go. It is not just a case of flipping a bit; you have to know how the different qubits evolve differently in time and how to correct for that before you measure them.
Let me give you an idea of how difficult this is. A typical qubit might have a lifetime of about 50 microseconds and a coherence time of 20 microseconds. What does this mean? It means that once your qubits are set, you have to apply error correction within the first 20 microseconds and complete a step of your calculation within 50 microseconds. That doesn't seem too bad, right?
But there's always a ""but."" The operations to manipulate a qubit—either to perform a logical operation or to correct an error—involve microwave pulses that have a certain amount of energy. They can either be short, sharp pulses or long, slow pulses, as long as the area of the pulse remains the same. Unfortunately, short, sharp pulses cause problems, so typical pulses are 50 to 60 nanoseconds long. Given that you need to have everything done within 50 microseconds, this means you have a total of 1,000 operations for calculation and error correction. This makes it an extra-tough problem.
Making bad neighbors clean up after themselves
The IBM researchers have solved this extra-tough problem. To simplify it considerably, they have a cluster of four data qubits that are coupled to a single qubit, called the syndrome bit. The state of the syndrome qubit depends on the states of all the other qubits. This connectivity is used to determine the rate at which qubits induce errors in one another, which is then used to correct errors before the computation is complete.
The system took me some time to puzzle out, but essentially it works like this. The qubits are electromagnetic waves oscillating back and forth in an electronic device. A small amount of the wave is coupled out and mixed with the wave from the neighboring qubit. If the two qubits are in the same state, then their electromagnetic waves combine in phase and provide a strong signal to the syndrome qubit. But if the two qubits are out of phase, they cancel and provide no signal to the syndrome qubit. Likewise, the second pair of qubits do the same, providing their own combined signal to the syndrome qubit. This is called interference.
The interference between the four data qubits controls the state of the syndrome bit. This can then be used to correct single errors that crop up in the four data qubits (e.g., a flip of one qubit). Essentially, the state of the syndrome qubit controls where the signal that fixes the error is sent.
To demonstrate how effective this error correction scheme is, the researchers focused on errors introduced through cross-talk. Cross-talk occurs when a qubit that is not involved in the current operation causes the value of a qubit that is involved to flip. One example of this is when the value of one of the four qubits is used to conditionally flip the value of a second. The two remaining qubits have a set state but are not involved in this particular operation. However, because all the qubits are coupled, the two bystanders can introduce an error by causing either the control or the data bit to flip states unexpectedly.
The critical thing about IBM's system is that it can correct the error during the computation. That is: we don't read out the qubit values and then attempt error correction. Instead, we anticipate that a bystander qubit will generate a wave that interferes and induces an error. This can be canceled out by understanding how the error will be introduced and undoing it before it causes a problem.
Simply put: the researchers don't know the state of any of the qubits, but they do know how to flip states, and they know the rate at which qubits drive each other to flip. They use that knowledge for error correction.
The operation takes a certain amount of time. Over this time, the state of the bystander qubit interferes via an electromagnetic wave with a certain phase and amplitude. The researchers wait a bit, then flip the bystander qubit. This keeps its amplitude the same but inverts the phase, causing constructive interference to become destructive interference. After waiting for the same amount of time, the net effect of the bystander qubit is exactly nothing, as the inverted phase undoes everything that the qubit initially did to its neighbors.
After that, the researchers flip the bystander back to its original state so that it can also be used without error. By carefully sequencing the operational pulses and these error-correcting pulses, researchers can reduce the probability of errors significantly.
How do I get to play with this?
IBM didn't provide a location for experiencing this fancy new device. But a quick Internet search revealed that you can get access here (registration required). Apparently, IBM really wants people who actually have a serious need for quantum computing to sign up, so I haven't actually tried it myself.
In any case, five qubits is still too few to do anything useful. But, if you think you might have a good reason to use quantum computing in the future, I suggest you register and play around, because IBM has a very aggressive timetable for scaling: it expects to hit between 50 and 100 qubits within the next decade. At 50 qubits, IBM will be able to do useful stuff. That means useful qubit numbers should be coming within five years and toys that do neat tricks a couple of years later.

A team combining Microsoft researchers and Niels Bohr Institute academics is confident that it has found the key to creating a quantum computer.
If they are right, then Microsoft will leap to the front of a race that has a tremendous prize - the power to solve problems that are beyond conventional computers.
In the lab are a series of white cylinders, which are fridges, cooled almost to absolute zero as part of the process of creating a qubit, the building block of a quantum computer.
""This is colder than deep space, it may be the coldest place in the universe,"" Prof Charlie Marcus tells me.
The team he leads is working in collaboration with other labs in the Netherlands, Australia and the United States in Microsoft's quantum research programme.
Right now, they are behind in the race - the likes of Google, IBM and a Silicon Valley start-up called Rigetti have already shown they can build systems with as many as 50 qubits. Microsoft has yet to demonstrate - in public at least - that it can build one.
But these scientists are going down a different route from their rivals, trying to create qubits with the properties of an elusive subatomic particle, whose existence was first suggested back in the 1930s by an Italian physicist Ettore Majorana.
This week scientists from Microsoft's laboratory in Delft published a paper in the journal Nature outlining the progress they had made in isolating Majorana particles.
Their belief is that this will lead to a much more stable qubit than the methods their rivals are using, which are highly prone to errors. That should mean scaling up to a fully operational quantum computer will be far easier.
At the Copenhagen lab they showed me through a powerful microscope the tiny wire where they have created these Majorana particles. Later over dinner, Prof Charlie Marcus tried, not altogether successfully, to demonstrate to someone whose last physics exam was more than 40 years ago what was unique about this approach with three pieces of bread and some cutlery.
""What's really astounding with this activity compared with what everybody else is doing is that we have to invent a particle that's never existed before and then use it for computing,"" he explains.
""It's a profoundly more exotic challenge than what's going on with other approaches to quantum computing.""
Other scientists taking those other approaches are looking on with great interest and a little scepticism.
""It's one of those things that on paper look incredibly exciting but physics has a habit of throwing up spanners in the works,"" says University College London's Prof John Morton, whose research involves using good old fashioned silicon to build qubits.
""Until we see the demonstration we don't know how well these Majorana qubits developed by Microsoft will really behave.""
He says this is a big year for the field, with the strong likelihood that Google or IBM will demonstrate what is known as quantum supremacy, where a problem that is beyond a conventional supercomputer is solved using quantum methods.
But Microsoft seems confident that its years of research will soon pay off.
""We will have a commercially relevant quantum computer - one that's solving real problems - within five years,"" says Dr Julie Love, Microsoft's director of quantum computing business development.
She is already out selling the company's customers a vision of a near future where quantum computers will help battle climate change, create new superconducting materials and super-charge machine learning.
""What it allows us to do is solve problems that with all of our supercomputers running in parallel would take the lifetime of the universe to solve in seconds, hours or days.""
So, the heat is on for the research team. Prof Charlie Marcus, who spent most of his career at Harvard before being recruited to run the Copenhagen lab, says his life has been about creating knowledge, not building products.
""My job is to find out what works and hand it off to the engineers and computer scientists who will turn it into a technology.""
Heading up the whole programme is Todd Holmdahl, the Microsoft executive previously in charge of the Hololens mixed reality headset and the Xbox games console - a measure of how serious the company is about making some quantum hardware pretty soon.
I pressed Prof Marcus on whether his team was going to hit that ambitious five year target set by his employer.
""We're sure going to try,"" he says with a grin.",4577,"['dwkqrmd', 'dwktx3c', 'dwl7wn5', 'dwksg95', 'dwkxzxh', 'dwkw2sy', 'dwm5sfp', 'dwm7imq', 'dwlorq9', 'dwltp6j', 'dwm4mdd']"

- Technology team
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has acquired the government's first quantum computer.
Quantum computers can make very complex calculations extremely quickly and their creators say they can solve the problems regular computers cannot.
The MoD will work with British company Orca Computing to explore applications for quantum technology in defence.
Stephen Till, of the MoD's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), called it a ""milestone moment"".
The computers found in most of our homes and workplaces process data in bits, which have a binary value of either zero or one.
Quantum computers instead use a two-state unit for data processing called a qubit.
This can represent digits like one or zero simultaneously through a quantum mechanical process called superposition, letting quantum computers bridge binary digits and cope with uncertainty where regular computers cannot.
Quantum computing experts and physicists say this means that the problems combed over by average computers for years could be solved in a matter of minutes.
Promise v reality
Prof Winfried Hensinger, head of the Sussex Centre for Quantum Technologies at University of Sussex, says the true potential of quantum computers will take time to fully materialise.
""They can't actually solve any practical problems yet. They're enabling you to maybe gauge the possibilities of what working on a quantum computer would have if you can scale this machine to really large system sizes.""
But he adds the promise of quantum computing, and the MoD's exploration of it, is still significant.
""Quantum computing can be disruptive in nearly any industry sector,"" Prof Hensinger adds.
""You can imagine that within defence, there's a lot of problems where optimisation can play a huge and very important role.""
Try explaining the ins and outs of quantum computing at a party and you may not hold your friends' attention for very long.
It is a very complex concept, and works in a completely different way to your laptop, or the phone in your pocket - or even the giant supercomputers that can process mind-boggling amounts of data in a nanosecond.
The promise of quantum computing is that it will help to solve problems that standard computers can't handle.
The idea is that it will be used in the fight against climate change, in the development of new drugs and improved artificial intelligence - and in this case, potentially to support the military.
Just like the early days of standard computers though, we are at the stage where these machines are very few and very cumbersome, not least because their building blocks, qubits, have to be kept frozen.
But Orca's machine does not require this, meaning the device can be a lot smaller, and a little bit more practical.
A vote of confidence
Richard Murray, chief executive of Orca Computing, says despite debate over the realities and capabilities of quantum computing, the company's work with the MoD is a ""significant vote of confidence"".
""Our partnership with MoD gives us the type of hands-on close interaction, working with real hardware which will help us to jointly discover new applications of this revolutionary new technology.""
The MoD will work with Orca's small PT-1 quantum computer, which the company says is the first of its kind to be able to operate at room temperature, rather than require sub-zero surroundings to keep heat-sensitive qubits cool.
Orca's system uses photons, or single units of light, to optimise machine learning tasks like image analysis and decision-making.
Mr Till says having access to Orca's quantum computer will accelerate the MoD's understanding of the technology.
""We expect the Orca system to provide significantly improved latency - the speed at which we can read and write to the quantum computer,"" he says.

The research showed that when the quantum network is fully achieved, it can offer instantaneous speeds, “teleporting” information between nodes in a secure and private way. Check out the details below right now!
Researchers Demonstrate New Qubit Teleportation Network
In a recent edition of the Nature, researchers from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands detailed the new teleportation-based qubit-transferring system that works between non-neighboring nodes in a quantum network. This is being considered the first step toward realizing an eventual quantum internet that will enable humans to set up multi-planetary internet networks.
The research leverages the entanglement property of quantum physics that binds two qubits together to act as one. This means that changes to one of the bonded qubits will be replicated to the other one, regardless of concerns such as distance. This allows information to be transferred from one node to another without physically moving the matter that holds the information. This is similar to “teleporting” the information from one place to another.
Althoug, the entanglement of two qubits has been achieved earlier, the new research has expanded the maximum number of qubits for the entanglement process from two to three. Now, this might sound like a small change but as small as it is, the new research opens up the opportunity for multi-lateral communications instead of just bilateral. This could enable powerful quantum computers in different regions across the world to seamlessly communicate with each other.
The research paper, reads, “With further improvements, for instance, by integrating multi-pulse memory decoupling sequences into the entanglement generation, demonstration of deterministic qubit teleportation (with no pre-shared entangled state) may come within reach, which opens the door to exploring applications that call the teleportation routine several times. In addition, future work will focus on further improving the phase stabilization and extending the current schemes for use in deployed fibre.“
The researchers note that the latest findings could pave the way for future quantum networks and open the door for teleportation-based, multi-node protocols, and quantum applications.

Perfect secrecy has come a step closer with the launch of the world's first computer network protected by unbreakable quantum encryption at a scientific conference in Vienna.
The network connects six locations across Vienna and in the nearby town of St Poelten, using 200 km of standard commercial fibre optic cables.
Quantum cryptography is completely different from the kinds of security schemes used on computer networks today.
These are typically based on complex mathematical procedures which are extremely hard for outsiders to crack but not impossible given sufficient computing resources or time.
But quantum systems use the laws of quantum theory, which have been shown to be inherently unbreakable.
Real breakthroughs are not found because you want to develop some new technology, but because you are curious and want to find out how the world is
Anton Zeilinger, Vienna University
The basic idea of quantum cryptography was worked out 25 years ago by Charles Bennett of IBM and Gilles Brassard of Montreal University, who was in Vienna to see the network in action.
""All quantum security schemes are based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, on the fact that you cannot measure quantum information without disturbing it,"" he explained.
""Because of that, one can have a communications channel between two users on which it's impossible to eavesdrop without creating a disturbance. An eavesdropper would create a mark on it. That was the key idea.""
In practice this means using the ultimate quantum objects: photons, the ""atoms of light"". Incredibly faint beams of light equating to single photons fired a million times a second raced between the nodes in the Vienna network.
Each node, housed in a different Siemens office (Siemens has provided the fibre links), contains a small rack of electronics - boxes about the size of a PC - and a handful of sensitive light detectors.
Numerical key
From the detected photons, a totally secret numerical key can be distilled, which encodes the users' data much like the keys used in normal computer networks do.
The advantage is that no-one else can know the key without revealing themselves.
As we saw in the demonstration, when an intruder did try to listen in on the quantum exchange, photons became scrambled, and a rise in the error rate at the node detectors signalled the attack. The system automatically shut down without being compromised.
More importantly, the demonstration also showed that the network is robust.
If one quantum link breaks down, the connections can be re-routed via other nodes, much as phone calls get re-routed automatically through a telecoms network, so that any two users on the network can remain in continuous secure contact.
Dr Hannes Huebel of Vienna University, operating one of the nodes, explained how robustness was now as important as security in the development of quantum encryption systems.
""We are constantly in touch with insurance companies and banks, and they say it's nearly better that they lose 10m euros than if the system is down for two hours, because that might be more damaging for the bank,"" said Dr Huebel.
""So that's what we have to prove, that we have a reliable system that delivers quantum keys for several weeks without interruption, and then they might be more interested.""
Polarised light
The final element of the EU-sponsored project (called SECO-QC) was the interconnection of different realisations of quantum cryptography.
There are many ways photons of light can encode a numerical key: through the direction they're polarised (like Polaroid glasses) for example, or the precise timing of their arrival.
Different schemes have different strengths and weaknesses, and a viable network would have to handle whatever individual users choose to use, explained the project's director, Christian Monyk - just as a mobile phone network has to handle handsets from many manufacturers.
Quantum cryptography is a surprising outgrowth of recondite arguments that bounced around for decades about the meaning of quantum mechanics.
Albert Einstein, who discovered the quantum properties of photons of light - indeed, discovered the very concept of the photon - always resisted quantum theory's spooky behaviour, ""God does not play dice"", being among his oft-quoted objections.
But experiments eventually proved that he apparently does, and also laid the technical foundations for today's quantum information revolution - cryptography, teleportation, and computation.
One of the grandees of quantum science, Vienna University's Anton Zeilinger, used the occasion to argue for continued funding of fundamental science in these increasingly application-focused days.
""Real breakthroughs are not found because you want to develop some new technology, but because you are curious and want to find out how the world is,"" Dr Zeilinger said.
""It may not have surprised the founding fathers of quantum science that technology has advanced so that you can play with individual quantum systems, in great detail.
""Maybe this would not surprise, but what could surprise them is that people are thinking and doing practical applications.""",5193,"['c05s0k5', 'c05s0q8']"

Launched by China Telecom, Tianyi No 1 2022 is a smartphone mounted with a quantum-secured encryption module and purpose-built SIM card that can encrypt and decipher voice calls on the phone using the quantum key distribution, Science Daily reported Tuesday.
Chinese scientists, some of whom were part of the founding team of QuantumCTeck, tested the quantum key distribution with the world's first quantum satellite Micius launched in August 2016
The telecom giant and the startup QuantumCTeck set up a joint venture in 2021 to develop quantum-based communication and bring the ingenious know-how to market.
Chinese scientists, some of whom were part of the founding team of QuantumCTeck, tested the quantum key distribution with the world's first quantum satellite Micius launched in August 2016.
Unlike traditional cryptography, the technology uses single photons in quantum superposition states by which the key is embedded to guarantee unconditional security between distant parties.
Quantum superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, stating that, much like waves in classical physics, any two or more quantum states can be added together.
The communication is, therefore, ""unhackable"" as any attempt to intercept the key would be known immediately both to the sender and the intended recipient.
""When a user initiates a quantum-secured chat, a secret key will be generated at random to verify his or her identity,"" said Zhang Rutong, an engineer with QuantumCTeck. ""After verification, the quantum network will generate a new real-time key to encrypt voice data.""
""The key is randomly generated, hard to crack and discarded immediately after calling,"" Zhang added.
The service is available when both senders and recipients use the quantum-based phone.

But what does having a quantum internet mean?
The Next Level
The word “quantum” sounds so advanced and complex that people tend to get hyped up about anything attached to it. While not every quantum breakthrough elicits a positive response, in the case of a so-called quantum internet, people have a reason to be excited.
In the simplest of terms, a quantum internet would be one that uses quantum signals instead of radio waves to send information. But let’s explain that a bit further.
The internet as we know it uses radio frequencies to connect various computers through a global web in which electronic signals are sent back and forth. In a quantum internet, signals would be sent through a quantum network using entangled quantum particles.
Following what Einstein called “spooky action at a distance,” entangled particles exist in a special state that allows information carried in one to be instantaneously reflected in another — a sort of quantum teleportation.
Researchers have recently made significant progress in building this quantum communication network. China launched the world’s first quantum communication satellite last year, and they’ve since been busy testing and extending the limitations of sending entangled photons from space to ground stations on Earth and then back again. They’ve also managed to store information using quantum memory. By the end of August, the nation plans to have a working quantum communication network to boost the Beijing-Shanghai internet.
Leading these efforts is Jian-Wei Pan of the University of Science and Technology of China, and he expects that a global quantum network could exist by 2030. That means a quantum internet is just 13 years away, if all goes well.
Quantum Web Surfing?
So, what does a quantum internet mean for regular internet users? As far as typical internet surfing goes, probably not much.
It’s highly unlikely that you’ll be using the quantum internet to update your social media feed, for one. “In many cases, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to communicate quantum mechanically,” University of Washington physicist Kai-Mei Fu told WIRED. For such things, regular internet communication is enough.
The quantum internet would excel, however, at sending information securely. Through what’s known as quantum encryption or quantum cryptography, people would be able to send “unhackable” data over a quantum network. This is because quantum cryptography uses a mechanic called quantum key distribution (QKD), which means an encrypted message and its keys are sent separately. Tampering with such a message causes it to be automatically destroyed, with both the sender and the receiver notified of the situation.
A quantum internet could also speed up access to a working quantum computer by putting quantum computing in the cloud. Instead of trying to get your hands on a physical quantum computer, which we still haven’t quite managed to make publicly available, you could access one through the cloud.
A regular personal computer could transmit or access quantum-encrypted information through this cloud-based quantum computer. At the very least, you could send “unhackable” emails. “Users might not want to send their information classically, where it could be eavesdropped,” Fu told WIRED.
Essentially, a quantum internet would most likely become a specialized branch of the regular internet, one we would only connect to for specific tasks. However, even if the quantum internet doesn’t work the same way the current internet does, one thing is for sure: the cutting-edge technology has the potential to benefit everyone, from hardcore physicists to regular Joes streaming the latest (not leaked) episode of Game of Thrones.",3846,"['dm7wbcj', 'dm7uo8f', 'dm7zf9q', 'dm7sekc', 'dm7vaut', 'dm7w9jm', 'dm7z4d6', 'dm8w64w', 'dm7wo8b']"

Google scientists said they made a breakthrough in one of the most cutting-edge areas of computing, publishing a paper that demonstrates how much faster quantum computers could be than today’s computers.
In the paper, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, the scientists said an experimental quantum processor they developed took seconds to carry out a computation that would take the world’s fastest supercomputer thousands of years. This is known as “quantum supremacy,” and it would mark a major breakthrough in the experimental field.
Quantum computing is complex and very much at the research stage. It involves computing technology based on the principles of quantum theory.
Instead of bits, which today’s computers use to process information, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits. Where classical computers are constrained by how fast they can switch between outputting zeros and ones, quantum computers would face no such constraints, because qubits theoretically can exist in both states simultaneously.
The upshot is that quantum computers would be able to carry out particular tasks exponentially faster - millions of times as fast as a standard computer. Google said this is what it demonstrated.
John Martinis and Sergio Boixo, two senior scientists at Google AI Quantum, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday that they were motivated to run the experiment to find out whether quantum computing would ""ever do something useful"" and was ""worth investing in.""
""For such large-scale endeavors it is good engineering practice to formulate decisive short-term goals that demonstrate whether the designs are going in the right direction,"" they wrote. ""So, we devised an experiment as an important milestone to help answer these questions.""
The scientists' experiment involved building a 54-qubit processor, named Sycamore, made up of ""fast, high-fidelity quantum logic gates.""
They then tested Sycamore's computing ability and how long it would take to perform one target calculation. Setting the bar for success high, the scientists agreed on ""a sensitive computational benchmark that fails if just a single component of the computer is not good enough,"" Martinis and Boixo said.
The scientists said Sycamore performed the target calculation in 200 seconds, while it would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10,000 years to produce a similar output.
Peter Knight, a senior physicist at Imperial College London, described Google's claims as ""compelling.""
Knight told the BBC's ""Today"" program on Wednesday that Google's experiment was ""a real breakthrough"" in quantum-computing research.
Knight said that though IBM had done similar research, he ""always felt that it was likely"" that Google's group ""would be there first.""
A draft paper on the same Google experiment reportedly appeared on NASA's website in August but was swiftly taken down.
As quantum computing remains very much in its infancy, it's difficult to imagine how it might affect society, though no one disputes its potential to affect just about everything. Knight briefly touched on one area: data security. He said that while any threat posed by quantum computing to processes such as encryption was distant, it was still there.

A Google research paper was temporarily posted online this week, the Financial Times reported Friday, and said the quantum computer's processor allowed a calculation to be performed in just over 3 minutes. That calculation would take 10,000 years on IBM's Summit, the world's most powerful commercial computer, Google reportedly said.
Google researchers are throwing around the term ""quantum supremacy"" as a result, the FT said, because their quantum computer can solve tasks that can't otherwise be solved. ""To our knowledge, this experiment marks the first computation that can only be performed on a quantum processor,"" the research paper reportedly said.
Google declined to comment on the FT's report.
The tech giant unveiled itsin March 2018.
""We are cautiously optimistic that quantum supremacy can be achieved with Bristlecone,"" said Julian Kelly, a research scientist at Google's Quantum AI Lab, said at the time. ""We believe the experimental demonstration of a quantum processor outperforming a supercomputer would be a watershed moment for our field.""

The discovery could pave the way for a class of batteries that charge faster the bigger they get – as well as being able to charge just from ambient light in a room.
“Superabsorption is the idea that the rate at which the light can be absorbed by the molecule, actually increases as you increase the number of molecules,” explains Dr James Quach, a researcher at the University of Adelaide, and lead author on a paper describing the research, published in Science Advances.
“This is a quantum collective effect.”
Superabsorption is key to the idea of quantum batteries. If molecules can absorb light at increasing speeds, they can be used to build quantum batteries which charge at increasing speeds.
Quach describes this as a “counterintuitive and powerful concept”.
“The more quantum batteries you had, the less time it would take to charge.” Specifically, the time would be related to the square root of the number of batteries lined up together.
While superabsorption has been demonstrated with small numbers of atoms, this is the first example of the concept at a larger scale.
“For a long time, this was just a theoretical idea,” says Quach. “We were the first show this with organic molecules.”
Quach and colleagues built a series of “microcavities”: thin layers of light-absorbing organic molecules, a few nanometres in width and a few square centimetres in area, using a technique called electron beam deposition.
When they set the cavities up with lasers to charge, they were able to observe the microcavities charging at super-fast speeds. The larger the cavity, the faster the charging.
The researchers believe this discovery can be used to build a prototype quantum battery.
“What I want to do is to build a photo-rechargeable quantum battery,” says Quach.
“This quantum battery will essentially have three layers: there’ll be a charging layer, a storage layer and a discharge layer. All the quantum stuff will be in the charging layer.
“The photo-rechargeable quantum battery, as the name implies, will be charged with ambient light.”
This battery could work as a small, off-grid source of power, possibly as an implant in Internet of Things devices and similar technology.
It would be similar to current solar panel and battery units, but – because the charging and the storage all happens in one system – simpler to integrate and use.
Quach says it’s hard to judge how long this will take, but he hopes that it could be done in three to five years.

Fixing things will be tricky
AS EVERY SCHOOLCHILD knows, some sorts of mathematics are harder than others. In the classroom, that is annoying. Outside, it can be useful. For instance, given two prime numbers, however large, multiplying them together to find their product is easy. But the reverse—factorising that product back into its constituent primes without knowing in advance what those primes are—is hard, and becomes rapidly harder as the number to be factorised gets bigger.
Factorising numbers into their constituent primes may sound esoteric, but the one-way nature of the problem—and of some other, closely related mathematical tasks—is the foundation on which much modern encryption rests. Such encryption has plenty of uses. It defends state secrets, and the corporate sort. It protects financial flows and medical records. And it makes the $2trn e-commerce industry possible. Without it, credit-card details, bank transfers, emails and the like would zip around the internet unprotected, for anyone so minded to see or steal.
Nobody, however, is certain that the foundation of all this is sound. Though mathematicians have found no quick way to solve the prime-factors problem, neither have they proved that there isn’t one. In theory, any of the world’s millions of professional or amateur mathematicians could have a stroke of inspiration tomorrow and publish a formula that unravels internet cryptography—and most internet commerce with it.
Send in the qubits
In fact, something like this has already happened. In 1994 Peter Shor, a mathematician then working at Bell Laboratories, in America, came up with a quick and efficient way to find a number’s prime factors. The only catch was that for large numbers his method—dubbed Shor’s algorithm—needs a quantum computer to work.
Quantum computers rely on the famous weirdness of quantum mechanics to perform certain sorts of calculation far faster than any conceivable classical machine. Their fundamental unit is the “qubit”, a quantum analogue of the ones and zeros that classical machines manipulate. By exploiting the quantum-mechanical phenomena of superposition and entanglement, quantum computers can perform some forms of mathematics—though only some—far faster than any conceivable classical machine, no matter how beefy.
When Dr Shor made his discovery such computers were the stuff of science fiction. But in 2001 researchers at IBM announced that they had built one, programmed it with Shor’s algorithm, and used it to work out that the prime factors of 15 are three and five. This machine was about the most primitive quantum computer imaginable. But there has been steady progress since. Alibaba, Alphabet (Google’s parent), IBM, Microsoft and the like are vying to build commercial versions, and the governments of America and China, in particular, are sponsoring research into the matter.
Big quantum computers will have applications in fields such as artificial intelligence and chemistry. But it is the threat posed by Shor’s algorithm that draws most public attention. Large organisations may be able to get around the problem using so-called quantum cryptography. This detects eavesdroppers in a way that cannot be countered. But it is expensive, experimental and unsuitable for the internet because it must run on a special, dedicated network. For most people, therefore, the best hope of circumventing Shor’s algorithm is to find a bit of one-way maths that does not give quantum computers an advantage.
There are candidates for this. Cryptographers are debating the relative merits of such mathematical curiosities as supersingular isogenies, structured and unstructured lattices, and multivariate polynomials as foundations for quantum-proof cryptography. But translating a piece of maths into usable computer code and then delivering it to the zillions of machines that will need updating will not be easy.
One question is, when is the deadline? When will an internet-breaking computer actually be available? Today’s best machines can manipulate a few dozen qubits. Brian LaMacchia, who runs the security and cryptography team at Microsoft Research, thinks a “cryptographically interesting” quantum computer might be able to handle somewhere between about 1,000 and 10,000 of them. Predicting progress is hard. But Dr LaMacchia reckons such a machine might be ready some time between 2030 and 2040.
That sounds reassuringly far away. But several researchers argue that things have already been left too late. Though many communications are ephemeral, some people encrypt messages that they hope will remain secret for a long time. Spies and policemen around the world already store reams of online data in the hope that, even if they cannot decrypt them now, they may be able to do so in future. As Peter Schwabe, a cryptographer at Radboud University in the Netherlands, observes: “If someone ten or 20 years from now can decrypt my present-day communications with my bank, well, I probably don’t care too much about that. But if I’m a dissident in some repressive country, talking to other dissidents? That might be a different story.”
The second problem is how long a fix will take. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an American standards organisation whose decisions are often followed around the world, is running a competition to kick the tyres on various quantum-resistant proposals. But its conclusions are not due until 2024. And as Nick Sullivan, who is in charge of cryptography at Cloudflare, an internet-infrastructure firm, observes, history suggests that, even once a new standard is agreed, the upgrade will be slow and messy. Despite—or perhaps because of—the information-technology industry’s obsession with novelty, the internet resembles ancient cities like Rome and Istanbul, with modern structures built atop forgotten layers of old, unmaintained code.
For example, in 1996 researchers reported the first weaknesses in MD5, a type of widely used cryptographic algorithm called a hash function. A drop-in replacement was readily available in the form of another algorithm called SHA-1. After more than two decades of exhortations to upgrade, though—not to mention high-profile cyber-attacks exploiting MD5’s weaknesses—the older algorithm is often still used. Similarly, a vulnerability called FREAK, discovered in 2015, relied on the fact that many modern applications, including the default browser in Google’s Android operating system and the White House’s website, could be persuaded to revert to old, easily breakable cryptography installed in order to comply with long-abandoned American export regulations.
Testing, testing
Those with the most power to chivvy things along are the big companies that control much of the internet’s pipework. Even while NIST deliberates, they are beginning to run tests of their own. At Microsoft, Dr LaMacchia plans to test quantum-resistant encryption on the links that connect the firm’s data centres. Google has already tried integrating different kinds of quantum-resistant cryptography into experimental versions of Chrome, its web browser, and has worked with Cloudflare to test the impacts in the real world.
The results have been mostly encouraging, but not wholly so. Changing the encryption changes the way browsers negotiate connections with websites. In Google’s tests of the 2,500 most popular websites, some 21 of them—including LinkedIn, a social network, and Godaddy.com, a domain registrar—could not cope with the extra data involved, and refused to connect. And all of the proposed quantum-resistant schemes imposed noticeable delays compared with conventional cryptography.
Big firms will have power in other ways, too. Vadim Lyubashevsky, a quantum-computing researcher at IBM, points out that quantum computers need lots of coddling. Most must be cooled to a temperature close to absolute zero. This means that, for the foreseeable future, access to them will be sold as a cloud-computing service in which users rent time from the machines’ owners. That gives companies the power to review code before it is run, says Dr Lyubashevsky, which could help limit nefarious uses. (Governments, though, will be able to shell out for their own machines.)
There are other wrinkles. The new cryptographic schemes generally require more computational grunt than the old sort, says Mr Sullivan. For desktop machines and smartphones, that is unlikely to be a problem. But smaller chips, embedded in gizmos from industrial-control systems to sensors, may struggle. Another worry is that the new algorithms may come with unforeseen weaknesses of their own. Mathematicians have had decades to attack the prime-factor problem, says Graham Steel, the boss of Cryptosense, a cryptography-focused security firm. The maths that underlie post-quantum schemes have not been similarly battle-tested. For that reason, the first implementations may hedge their bets by using both old and new sorts of cryptography at once.
The big companies are unlikely to commit themselves fully to an upgrade until the NIST has decided on the new standards. And even when that happens, the sheer size of the task is daunting. Mr Steel says one of his clients has thousands of apps that need updating. As chips migrate into everything from cars and children’s toys to lighting systems and smart electricity meters, the amount of work will only grow.
All this means that quantum-proofing the internet is shaping up to be an expensive, protracted and probably incomplete job. Dr Steel compares it to dealing with the millennium bug, when a quirk in how a lot of programs handled dates meant they had to be retrofitted, at great expense, to cope with the transition from the year 1999 to the year 2000. In the event, thanks to the efforts of thousands of programmers, the millennium bug was mostly dodged. These days, the stakes are higher. The world is now considerably more computerised than it was then. Either way, it means plenty of steady work for cryptographers.

It does this by sending out a burst of radio energy, which bounces back when it encounters another object. So-called “stealth” aircraft try to get around this by becoming invisible to radar — either by using flat, angular shapes to reflect radar signals away from radar equipment or by using materials which absorb radar signals.
So far, so old news, right? Perhaps so, but things could be about to change if a new report coming out of China proves to be correct. At a recent air show in the city of Zhuhai, state-owned Chinese defense giant China Electronics Technology Group Corporation displayed what it claims to be a quantum radar that’s able to detect even the stealthiest of stealth aircraft. The company claims to have been working on the technology for years, and to have tested it for the first time in 2015.
In principle, a quantum radar functions like a regular radar — only that instead of sending out a single beam of electromagnetic energy, it uses two split streams of entangled photons. Only one of these beams is sent out, but due to a quirk of quantum physics both streams will display the same changes, despite being potentially miles apart. As a result, by looking at the stream which remains back home it’s possible to work out what has happened to the other beam.
According to a brochure from the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, the new quantum radar could “solve the traditional bottleneck [of] detection of low observable target detection, survival under electronic warfare conditions, [and] platform load limitations.”
What’s less clear is whether this is real functioning technology or an example of the Chinese government bragging about some technology which does not yet exist. “Without being able to take the lid off what has been shown here, we can’t be sure if this is an elaborate hoax,” Alan Woodward, a professor of physics at the U.K.’s University of Surrey, told New Scientist.
The demonstration was only available to Chinese media, and foreign press — including a reporter for the publication Aviation Week — were asked to leave. Still, if this does turn out to be legit, it will represent a game changer in the world of stealth aircraft.

Previously, Ames relied on the D-Wave 2X system made available in August 2015. The new 2000Q model hit the quantum computing scene in January packing 2,000 qubits, nearly doubling the number of qubits provided in the previous 2X-branded generation.
As a brief explainer, a qubit is short for a quantum bit, which is a unit of quantum information. It’s different than a standard binary bit in that the state of a qubit can be zero, one, or a superposition of those two states whereas a normal bit can only be zero or one. The superposition aspect is part of quantum mechanics declaring that any two or more distinct quantum states can be added together to create another valid quantum state. As this video demonstrates, just imagine that a qubit state can be a slice of pizza and a bagel at the same time.
The point is, quantum computing is the next step in the evolution of computing on a whole. It’s based on the use of quantum particles that can exist in multiple states at the same time. This increases the overall computation power along with their ability to become entangled with each other, providing parallel processing that can cut down on the overall computing time. That means quantum computers can solve problems that usually take a very long time for traditional bit-based computers to complete.
“The new system will be the third generation of D-Wave technology installed at Ames,” D-Wave CEO Vern Brownell said. “We are pleased that Google, NASA, and USRA value the increased performance embodied in our latest generation of technology, the D-Wave 2000Q system, for their critical applications.”
Right now, the drawback to quantum computing is the needed extreme environment conditions. The processor resides in a high vacuum with a pressure of 10 billion times lower than the Earth’s atmosphere. The qubits also must be chilled close to absolute zero “to harness quantum effects,” thus the environment inside the massive 2000Q enclosure is 180 times colder than interstellar space, or 0.015 degrees above absolute zero.
Unfortunately, D-Wave isn’t forthcoming about all the hardware inside the 2000Q system. However, here are a few additional highlights:
- Provides 200 I/O and control lines from room temperature to the chilled processor.
- The overall system consumes less than 25 kilowatts of power.
- It’s shielded to 50,000 times less than Earth’s magnetic field.
- The processor is enclosed in a closed cycle dilution refrigerator.
D-Wave said that NASA is installing the 2000Q quantum computer at its Ames Research Center later in 2017. Used by the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory team, it will be accessed to address the challenges NASA faces by utilizing quantum computing approaches and creating quantum artificial intelligent algorithms. NASA began its quantum journey with the D-Wave Two (2013) followed by the D-Wave 2X (2015).

A team of scientists at USC has verified that quantum effects are indeed at play in the first commercial quantum optimization processor. The team demonstrated that the D-Wave processor housed at the USC-Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center behaves in a manner that indicates that quantum mechanics plays a functional role in the way it works. The demonstration involved a small subset of the chip's 128 qubits.
This means that the device appears to be operating as a quantum processor -- something that scientists had hoped for but have needed extensive testing to verify.
The quantum processor was purchased from Canadian manufacturer D-Wave nearly two years ago by Lockheed Martin and housed at the USC Viterbi Information Sciences Institute (ISI). As the first of its kind, the task for scientists putting it through its paces was to determine whether the quantum computer was operating as hoped.
""Using a specific test problem involving eight qubits we have verified that the D-Wave processor performs optimization calculations (that is, finds lowest energy solutions) using a procedure that is consistent with quantum annealing and is inconsistent with the predictions of classical annealing,"" said Daniel Lidar, scientific director of the Quantum Computing Center and one of the researchers on the team, who holds joint appointments with the USC Viterbi School of Engineering and the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
Quantum annealing is a method of solving optimization problems using quantum mechanics -- at a large enough scale, potentially much faster than a traditional processor can.
Research institutions throughout the world build and use quantum processors, but most only have a few quantum bits, or ""qubits.""
Qubits have the capability of encoding the two digits of one and zero at the same time -- as opposed to traditional bits, which can encode distinctly either a one or a zero. This property, called ""superposition,"" along with the ability of quantum states to ""tunnel"" through energy barriers, are hoped to play a role in helping future generations of the D-Wave processor to ultimately perform optimization calculations much faster than traditional processors.
With 108 functional qubits, the D-Wave processor at USC inspired hopes for a significant advance in the field of quantum computing when it was installed in October 2011 -- provided it worked as a quantum information processor. Quantum processors can fall victim to a phenomenon called ""decoherence,"" which stifles their ability to behave in a quantum fashion.
The USC team's research shows that the chip, in fact, performed largely as hoped, demonstrating the potential for quantum optimization on a larger-than-ever scale.
""Our work seems to show that, from a purely physical point of view, quantum effects play a functional role in information processing in the D-Wave processor,"" said Sergio Boixo, first author of the research paper, who conducted the research while he was a computer scientist at ISI and research assistant professor at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
Boixo and Lidar collaborated with Tameem Albash, postdoctoral research associate in physics at USC Dornsife; Federico M. Spedalieri, computer scientist at ISI; and Nicholas Chancellor, a recent physics graduate at USC Dornsife. Their findings will be published in Nature Communications on June 28.
The news comes just two months after the Quantum Computing Center's original D-Wave processor -- known commercially as the ""Rainier"" chip -- was upgraded to a new 512-qubit ""Vesuvius"" chip. The Quantum Computing Center, which includes a magnetically shielded box that is kept frigid (near absolute zero) to protect the computer against decoherence, was designed to be upgradable to keep up with the latest developments in the field.
The new Vesuvius chip at USC is currently the only one in operation outside of D-Wave. A second such chip, owned by Google and housed at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, is expected to become operational later this year.
Next, the USC team will take the Vesuvius chip for a test drive, putting it through the same paces as the Rainier chip.

This groundbreaking approach to molecular simulations could have profound implications not just for quantum chemistry, but also for a range of fields from cryptography to materials science.
""One of the most important problems for many theoretical chemists is how to execute exact simulations of chemical systems,"" says author Alán Aspuru-Guzik, assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University. ""This is the first time that a quantum computer has been built to provide these precise calculations.""
The work, described this week in Nature Chemistry, comes from a partnership between Aspuru-Guzik's team of theoretical chemists at Harvard and a group of experimental physicists led by Andrew White at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. Aspuru-Guzik's team coordinated experimental design and performed key calculations, while his partners in Australia assembled the physical ""computer"" and ran the experiments.
""We were the software guys,"" says Aspuru-Guzik, ""and they were the hardware guys.""
While modern supercomputers can perform approximate simulations of simple molecular systems, increasing the size of the system results in an exponential increase in computation time. Quantum computing has been heralded for its potential to solve certain types of problems that are impossible for conventional computers to crack.
Rather than using binary bits labeled as ""zero"" and ""one"" to encode data, as in a conventional computer, quantum computing stores information in qubits, which can represent both ""zero"" and ""one"" simultaneously. When a quantum computer is put to work on a problem, it considers all possible answers by simultaneously arranging its qubits into every combination of ""zeroes"" and ""ones.""
Since one sequence of qubits can represent many different numbers, a quantum computer would make far fewer computations than a conventional one in solving some problems. After the computer's work is done, a measurement of its qubits provides the answer.
""Because classical computers don't scale efficiently, if you simulate anything larger than four or five atoms -- for example, a chemical reaction, or even a moderately complex molecule -- it becomes an intractable problem very quickly,"" says author James Whitfield, research assistant in chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard. ""Approximate computations of such systems are usually the best chemists can do.""
Aspuru-Guzik and his colleagues confronted this problem with a conceptually elegant idea.
""If it is computationally too complex to simulate a quantum system using a classical computer,"" he says, ""why not simulate quantum systems with another quantum system?""
Such an approach could, in theory, result in highly precise calculations while using a fraction the resources of conventional computing.
While a number of other physical systems could serve as a computer framework, Aspuru-Guzik's colleagues in Australia used the information encoded in two entangled photons to conduct their hydrogen molecule simulations. Each calculated energy level was the result of 20 such quantum measurements, resulting in a highly precise measurement of each geometric state of molecular hydrogen.
""This approach to computation represents an entirely new way of providing exact solutions to a range of problems for which the conventional wisdom is that approximation is the only possibility,"" says Aspuru-Guzik.
Ultimately, the same quantum computer that could transform Internet cryptography could also calculate the lowest energy conformations of molecules as complex as cholesterol.
Aspuru-Guzik and Whitfield's Harvard co-authors on the Nature Chemistry paper are Ivan Kassal, Jacob D. Biamonte, and Masoud Mohseni. Financial support was provided by the US Army Research Office and the Australian Research Council Federation Fellow and Centre of Excellence programs. Aspuru-Guzik recently received support from the DARPA Young Investigator Program, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation to pursue research towards practical quantum simulators.

On Monday, the company unveiled Eagle, a 127 qubit quantum processor. IBM claims it’s the first such processor that can’t be simulated by a classical supercomputer. To make sense of what that means, the company says to simulate Eagle you would need more classical bits than there are atoms in every human being on the planet. IBM is crediting the breakthrough to a new design that puts the processor’s control components on multiple physical levels while the qubits are located on a single layer. It’s a design the company says allows for a significant increase in computing power.
One aspect of Eagle the company isn’t talking about at the moment is quantum volume. Cointed by IBM, it’s a metric that attempts to measure the performance of a quantum computer by taking a holistic view of its different parts. Not only does it take into account qubits, but also the way in which they interact with one another. The higher the quantum volume, the more capable a quantum computer is at tackling difficult problems.
“Our first 127-qubit Eagle processor is available as an exploratory system on the IBM Cloud to select members of the IBM Quantum Network,” Jerry Chow, the director of IBM’s Quantum Hardware System Development unit, told Engadget. “Exploratory systems are early access to our latest technologies and so we do not guarantee uptime or a particular level of repeatable performance, as measured by quantum volume.”
Without knowing the quantum volume of the Eagle processor, it’s hard to say exactly how it compares to what's out there already. Last October, Honeywell claimed its System Model H1 had a quantum volume of 128 with just 10 connected qubits. For reference, earlier in the year IBM announced a 27 qubit system with a then industry-leading quantum volume of 64. Clearly, the company’s new processor is powerful, but qubits don’t tell the whole story here.
What’s also notable about Eagle is that IBM is not claiming quantum supremacy. According to the company, it’s a step toward that milestone, but the processor is not yet at the point where it can solve problems that classical computers cannot. In 2019, Google sparked controversy when it (briefly) claimed it had achieved the feat with its Sycamore system. At the time, IBM called the company’s claims “indefensible” based on the fact Google built the computer to solve one specific equation.
IBM will make Eagle available to select members of its Quantum Network starting next month.",2533,"['hkqpj5o', 'hkprut2', 'hkqarnb', 'hkpxddb', 'hkqemup', 'hkq8wee', 'hkqlq3d', 'hkqcpla', 'hkpp0va', 'hkrc585', 'hksjyhn', 'hkt1j75', 'hkr8sq5', 'hkqpj5o', 'hkprut2', 'hkqarnb', 'hkpxddb', 'hkqemup', 'hkq8wee', 'hkqlq3d', 'hkqcpla', 'hkpp0va', 'hkrc585', 'hksjyhn', 'hkt1j75', 'hkr8sq5']"

(According to Jian-Wei Pan, the major expert in this scientific field in China, “the next quantum breakthrough will happen in five years.”) The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) wanted to put seven encryption formulas to the test in order to determine their vulnerability to the new processing systems. Ward Beullens, from the IBM research center in Zurich, Switzerland, managed to crack an encrypted code in just 53 hours and with a simple laptop.
The challenge involved taking seven encryption models to the test bench. The plan was to create an impenetrable technique to develop invulnerable transmission formulas. NIST received 69 proposals, of which in the end there were only four encryption formulas and three secure signatures for the identification and execution of financial transactions.
One of the last of these three models was Rainbow, a signature system that has a secret key that is only known by the user and that can be verified by the recipient. Ward Beullens cracked the access system in a little less than a weekend and using only a laptop. This was the second time that Beullens has managed to do this. “I believe my previous attack was also fairly severe, and it was already clear that Rainbow would not be standardized.”
The researcher, who is the author of a study that was presented at the International Association for Cryptographic Research, explains: “Both attacks reduce the security level of Rainbow’s proposal below the requirements set by NIST. It would be possible to move to larger parameters to protect against the attacks at the cost of larger key sizes and signature sizes.”
Ray Perner and Daniel Smith-Tone, two math researchers involved in the standardization process of NIST, agree with the analysis. According to both of the scientists, before the current selection process “none of the parameters of Rainbow achieve their claimed security level,” but they admit that small changes are possible so that they can be reached.
However, Dustin Moody, also from NIST, believes that the “assault on Rainbow has been proven, and the method is now unlikely to be chosen as the final signature algorithm.”
Quantum computing is a race that is running in parallel to the security problems that it will generate. On the one hand, this science presents huge potential. According to Adán Cabello, a physicist from the University of Seville in Spain, “it will allow for quantum physics to be verified in regions that were inaccessible until now.” But it also represents a risk. For Mark Webber, from the University of Sussex and the main author of an investigation in AVS Quantum Science, “quantum computers are exponentially more powerful at breaking many encryption techniques than classical computers.”
Today, even the biggest supercomputer couldn’t represent a serious threat to BitcoinMark Webber, from the University of Sussex
Webber warns that the encryption that Bitcoin uses will one day be vulnerable to a quantum computing attack, but he clarifies: “Today, even the biggest supercomputer couldn’t represent a serious threat.”
A conventional current computer uses a bit as a basic unit of information (this can have two different values). In a quantum computer, the basic unit is the quantic bit, or qubit, which possesses an infinite number of states. According to Webber, latest-generation quantic computers today only have between 50 and 100 qubits, and, according to his team’s research, would need up to 300 million physical qubits to break Bitcoin’s security.
While that may appear out of reach, the quantic investigator from Sussex warns that the future advances could reduce even more the requirements for improvements both of quantum algorithms as well as the error-correction protocols. “Four years ago, we estimated a trapped ion device would need a billion physical qubits to break RSA encryption, requiring a device with an area of 100-by-100 square meters,” says Webber. “Now, with improvements across the board, this could see a dramatic reduction to an area of just 2.5-by-2.5 square meters.”
This will also be a problem for Bitcoin. According to Webber, “the Bitcoin network could perform a ‘hard-fork’ onto a quantum-secure encryption technique, but this may result in network scaling issues due to an increased memory requirement.”
For Jian-Wei Pan, security has to be a significant aspect of the development of quantum computing, but believes that the latter should be the priority. “Building a practically useful fault-tolerant quantum computer is one of the great challenges for human beings,” he says. “I am more concerned about how and when we will build one. The most formidable challenge for building a large-scale universal quantum computer is the presence of noise and imperfections. We need to use quantum error correction and fault-tolerant operations to overcome the noise and scale up the system.”",5027,"['i1zfsa3', 'i1zwtco', 'i1zqaka', 'i1zbk4f', 'i20arvh', 'i21qnhi', 'i20fw8x', 'i1zlniz', 'i213l2i', 'i237ckq', 'i2ngt66', 'i207laa', 'i20wyxx']"

The Commerce Department has added eight technology producers to its Entity List to prevent them from supporting the Chinese military's quantum computing efforts. Officials are concerned the entities could feed ""emerging"" US tech that could aid with breaking encryption, producing 'unbreakable' encryption and developing anti-stealth or anti-submarine systems.
The list focuses on a mix of companies and researchers, including QuantumCTek and the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale.

This is unlikely to put a stop to China's military uses of quantum computing when the country may need to research and develop much of the technology in-house.

The company is also set to make a 20 qubit quantum system available online for clients to try, with an updated superconducting design, connectivity and packaging. That'll let users run computations with a ""field-leading"" 90 microseconds of coherence, allowing ""high-fidelity quantum operations,"" IBM says.
Quantum computers work much differently than regular supercomputers, taking advantage of weird quantum physics principals like ""superposition."" In theory, they can run specific programs, like encryption-cracking algorithms, many, many times faster than regular computers.
The 50 qubit system (shown below) is a significant leap toward practical quantum computers. ""We are really proud of this, it's a big frickin' deal,"" IBM AI and quantum computer director Dario Gil told MIT Technology Review. Other players in quantum computing including Google, Intel and Rigetti.
IBM's 50 qubit computer is just a prototype, but it will soon have a working 20 qubit computer that users can try online by the end of 2017, with improvements planned throughout 2018. The company has already made lower-powered machines available for cloud use, and used a 7 qubit model to simulate a molecule, for example. IBM says around 60,000 users have run 1.7 million experiments, resulting in 35 research papers.
Quantum computers haven't been able to run programs that a regular computer can't, so the massive speed breakthrough many have hoped for has yet to arrive. Still, Google researchers said last month that a 50 qubit computer they're working on could surpass current supercomputers, achieving an (excellently-named) milestone called Quantum Supremacy.

The company has already hit a number of development milestones since it released its previous quantum roadmap in 2020, including the 127-qubit Eagle processor that uses quantum circuits and the Qiskit Runtime API. IBM announced on Wednesday that it plans to further scale its quantum ambitions and has revised the 2020 roadmap with an even loftier goal of operating a 4,000-qubit system by 2025.
Before it sets about building the biggest quantum computer to date, IBM plans release its 433-qubit Osprey chip later this year and migrate the Qiskit Runtime to the cloud in 2023, “bringing a serverless approach into the core quantum software stack,” per Wednesday’s release. Those products will be followed later that year by Condor, a quantum chip IBM is billing as “the world’s first universal quantum processor with over 1,000 qubits.”
This rapid four-fold jump in quantum volume (the number of qubits packed into a processor) will enable users to run increasingly longer quantum circuits, while increasing the processing speed — measured in CLOPS (circuit layer operations per second) — from a maximum of 2,900 OPS to over 10,000. Then it’s just a simple matter of quadrupaling that capacity in the span of less than 24 months.
To do so, IBM plans to first get sets of multiple processors to communicate with one another both in parallel and in series. This should help develop better error mitigation schemes and improve coordination between processors, both necessary components of tomorrow’s practical quantum computers. After that, IBM will design and deploy chip-level couplers, which “will closely connect multiple chips together to effectively form a single and larger processor,” according to the company, then build quantum communication links to connect those larger multi-processors together into even bigger clusters — essentially daisy-chaining increasingly larger clumps of processors together until they form a functional, modular 4,000-qubit computing platform.
“As quantum computing matures, we’re starting to see ourselves as more than quantum hardware,” IBM researcher Jay Gambetta wrote on Wednesday. “We’re building the next generation of computing. In order to benefit from our world-leading hardware, we need to develop the software and infrastructure capable of taking advantage of it.”
As such, IBM released a set of ready-made primitive programs earlier this year, “pre-built programs that allows developers easy access to the outputs of quantum computations without requiring intricate understanding of the hardware,” per the company. IBM intends to expand that program set in 2023, enabling developers to run them on parallelized quantum processors. “We also plan to enhance primitive performance with low-level compilation and post-processing methods, like introducing error suppression and mitigation tools,” Gambetta said. “These advanced primitives will allow algorithm developers to use Qiskit Runtime services as an API for incorporating quantum circuits and classical routines to build quantum workflows.”
These workflows will take a given problem, break it down into smaller quantum and classical programs, chew through those processes in either parallel or series depending on which is more efficient, and then use an orchestration layer to “circuit stitch” all those various data streams back into a coherent result that classical computers can understand. IBM calls its proprietary stitching infrastructure Quantum Serverless and, per the new roadmap, will deploy the feature to its core quantum software stack in 2023.
“We think by next year, we’ll begin prototyping quantum software applications for users hoping to use Qiskit Runtime and Quantum Serverless to address specific use cases,” Gambetta said. We’ll begin to define these services with our first test case — machine learning — working with partners to accelerate the path toward useful quantum software applications. By 2025, we think model developers will be able to explore quantum applications in machine learning, optimization, finance, natural sciences, and beyond.”
“For many years, CPU-centric supercomputers were society’s processing workhorse, with IBM serving as a key developer of these systems,” he continued. “In the last few years, we’ve seen the emergence of AI-centric supercomputers, where CPUs and GPUs work together in giant systems to tackle AI-heavy workloads. Now, IBM is ushering in the age of the quantum-centric supercomputer, where quantum resources — QPUs — will be woven together with CPUs and GPUs into a compute fabric. We think that the quantum-centric supercomputer will serve as an essential technology for those solving the toughest problems, those doing the most ground-breaking research, and those developing the most cutting-edge technology.”

It's not easy, especially since no one can really understand how the machine -- with its ones, zeros and superpositioned ""one-and-zeros"" -- actually functions. Instead, all you can do is throw increasingly complex questions at it, and hope that it answers them quicker than a top-end classical computer. This quest for evidence of so-called ""quantum speeedup"" has been going on for a while, with little in the way of positive results. Now, a freshly-published collaborative study involving Google (owner of a D-Wave box), Microsoft (owner of some very advanced traditional tech), and a team of university scientists, has achieved new results that are equally disappointing. Science magazine describes the study as ""the fairest comparison yet."" D:Wave's founder, meanwhile, has described it as ""total bullshit.""
The dispute partly arises over the choice of questions that were run through each type of machine. The latest study deliberately used questions that both computers could readily answer, and D-Wave claims that these were too simple. The company has also pointed out that it's a ""scrappy startup,"" whereas the rival classical machine had the benefit of decades of research and trillions of dollars of investment, so it's pretty remarkable that the quantum computer was even able to keep up. By contrast, the university-backed researchers say that their comparison was based on challenges that were tailored to be extremely easy for qubit-based processing, so there could and should have been evidence of speedup if quantum mechanics are truly being exploited.
It's not clear where things will go from here. The study has a conclusive-sounding tone, as does one of its lead researchers, Matthias Troyer from the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Zurich, who simply says ""we don't see quantum speedup."" Then again, Troyer acknowledges that other sorts of tests may reveal the phenomenon ""eventually."" Perhaps the onus is now on D-Wave to find some way to silence the skeptics, not just by keeping up with standard technology, but by surpassing it in a meaningful way. Whatever happens next, it sounds like relations between D-Wave and the scientific community are becoming fractured -- and that sort of tension will either speed progress up, or slow it right down.",2357,"['cicmog5', 'cicjop5']"

Since 2002, Hyperstealth has been in the business of designing camouflage patterns for military uniforms, vehicles, and installations. In 2010, at the International Camouflage Symposium, Hyperstealth’s CEO Guy Cramer demonstrated SmartCamo — a material that could reportedly adjust its camouflage markings to match its surroundings. We say “reportedly” because Cramer apparently published a video demonstration of SmartCamo, but then US military intervened and asked him to take it down. Presumably Quantum Stealth is a follow-up from SmartCamo.
Again, for security reasons, Cramer is saying very little about Quantum Stealth. All of the pictures that you see here, and on Hyperstealth’s site, are mock-ups, because “for security issues we can not show the actual technology.” Cramer says that both the US and Canadian military have seen Quantum Stealth in action, and that they’ve also confirmed that the material obscures the target from infrared (thermal) imaging. Below, you can see Cramer talking to CNN’s Pentagon correspondent about Quantum Stealth.
Now, we’ve written about invisibility cloaks in the past, but these have generally been very small, lab-based experiments that only work with very specific wavelengths of light. These invisibility cloaks generally work by bending light around an object using metamaterial waveguides — think of them as optical paths that negatively refract light, so that their detour around the object can’t be discerned. So far, we have only managed to develop metamaterials that bend specific wavelengths of light — so the object might be invisible to microwaves or infrared, but not both. Quantum Stealth reportedly works across the entire range of visible light, and infrared too. If this is really the case, Quantum Stealth completely redefines the state of the art.
In theory, Quantum Stealth works by bending light around the target, and Cramer certainly uses the right words to support his case — nanotechnology, metamaterials — but it’s still very hard to believe that a lone inventor in Canada has actually succeeded in creating an invisibility cloak. It’s not impossible, but it’s improbable. I want to say that there’s a clue in the name — that Quantum Stealth somehow uses some neat glitch in quantum mechanics to provide invisibility — but really, it’s probably just hyperbole, like the company’s name. If Quantum Stealth really exists, though, you’d assume that the US military would be quick to flaunt its new toy. After all, there’s nothing more terrifying than an invisible army.",2843,"['c7gjjeq', 'c7gq825', 'c7ghhpf', 'c7gjtx5', 'c7gk0qz', 'c7gjeg5', 'c7gsmiw', 'c7gllkl', 'c7giy33', 'c7gkfuq', 'c7gkbj9', 'c7gkkvc', 'c7gls5s', 'c7gnmem', 'c7gua5h', 'c7gjf7n', 'c7gkpji', 'c7gonv4', 'c7gqgqr', 'c7grq1z', 'c7gsrs1', 'c7gway5', 'c7gk126', 'c7gn8so', 'c7gjjeq', 'c7gq825', 'c7ghhpf', 'c7gjtx5', 'c7gk0qz', 'c7gjeg5', 'c7gsmiw', 'c7gllkl', 'c7giy33', 'c7gkfuq', 'c7gkbj9', 'c7gkkvc', 'c7gls5s', 'c7gnmem', 'c7gua5h', 'c7gjf7n', 'c7gkpji', 'c7gonv4', 'c7gqgqr', 'c7grq1z', 'c7gsrs1', 'c7gway5', 'c7gk126', 'c7gn8so']"

Here’s what they’ll need to do to win",,2022-09-02,François Candelon; Maxime Courtaux; Gabriel Nahas; Jean-François Bobier,The quantum computing arms race: Here's what it will take to win,"Every country is vying to get a head start in the race to the world’s quantum future. A year ago, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia teamed up to develop military applications of digital technologies, especially quantum computing technologies. That followed the passage in 2019 of the National Quantum Initiative Act by the U.S. Congress, which laid out the country’s plans to rapidly create quantum computing capabilities.
Earlier, Europe launched a $1 billion quantum computing research project, Quantum Flagship, in 2016, and its member states have started building a quantum communications infrastructure that will be operational by 2027. In like vein, China’s 14th Five Year Plan (2021-2025) prioritizes the development of quantum computing and communications by 2030. In all, between 2019 and 2021 China invested as much as $11 billion, Europe had spent $5 billion, the U.S. $3 billion, and the U.K. around $1.8 billion between to become tomorrow’s quantum superpowers.
As the scientific development of quantum technologies gathers momentum, creating quantum computers has turned into a priority for nations that wish to gain the next competitive advantage in the Digital Age. They’re seeking this edge for two very different reasons. On the one hand, quantum technologies will likely transform almost every industry, from automotive and aerospace to finance and pharmaceuticals. These systems could create fresh value of between $450 billion and $850 billion over the next 15 to 30 years, according to recent BCG estimates.
On the other hand, quantum computing systems will pose a significant threat to cybersecurity the world over, as we argued in an earlier column. Hackers will be able to use them to decipher the public keys generated by the RSA cryptosystem, and to break through the security of any conventionally-encrypted device, system, or network. It will pose a potent cyber-threat, popularly called Y2Q (Years to Quantum), to individuals and institutions as well as corporations and country governments. The latter have no choice but to tackle the unprecedented challenge by developing countermeasures such as post-quantum cryptography, which will itself require the use of quantum systems.
Countries have learned the hard way since the Industrial Revolution that general-purpose technologies, such as quantum computing, are critical for competitiveness. Consider, for instance, semiconductor manufacturing, which the U.S., China, South Korea, and Taiwan have dominated in recent times. When the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors led to a sudden fall in production over the last two years, it resulted in production stoppages and price increases in over 150 industries, including automobiles, computers, and telecommunications hardware. Many countries, among the members of the European Union, Brazil, India, Turkey, and even the U.S., were hit hard, and are now trying to rebuild their semiconductor supply chains. Similarly, China manufactures most of the world’s electric batteries, with the U.S. contributing only about 7% of global output. That’s why the U.S. has recently announced financial incentives to induce business to create more electric battery-manufacturing capacity at home.
Much worse could be in store if countries and companies don’t focus on increasing their quantum sovereignty right away. Because the development and deployment of such systems requires the efforts of the public and private sectors, it’s important for governments to compare their efforts on both fronts with those of other countries.
The U.S. is expected to be the global frontrunner in quantum computing, relying on its tech giants, such as IBM and Google, to invent quantum systems as well as numerous start-ups that are developing software applications. The latter attract almost 50% of the investments in quantum computing by venture capital and private equity funds, according to BCG estimates. Although the U.S. government has allocated only $1.1 billion, it has created mechanisms that effectively coordinate the efforts of all its agencies such as the NIST, DARPA, NASA, and NQI.
Breathing down the U.S.’s neck: China, whose government has spent more on developing quantum systems than any other. . Those investments have boosted academic research, with China producing over 10% of the world’s research in 2021, according to our estimates—second only to the U.S. The spillover effects are evident: Less than a year after Google’s quantum machine had solved in minutes a calculation that would have taken supercomputers thousands of years to unravel, the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) had cracked a problem three times tougher. As of September 2021, China hadn’t spawned as many startups as the U.S., but it was relying on its digital giants such as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent to develop quantum applications.
Trailing only the U.S. and China, the European Union’s quantum computing efforts are driven by its member states as well as the union. The EU’s Quantum Flagship program coordinates research projects across the continent, but those efforts aren’t entirely aligned yet. Several important efforts, such as those of France and Germany, run the risk of duplication or don’t exploit synergies adequately. While the EU has spawned several startups that are working on different levels of the technology stack—such as Finland’s IQM and France’s Pasqal—many seem unlikely to scale because of the shortage of late-stage funding. In fact, the EU’s startups have attracted only about one-seventh as much funding as their American peers, according to BCG estimates.
Finally, the U.K. was one of the first countries in the world to launch a government-funded quantum computing program. It’s counting on its educational policies and universities; scholarships for postgraduate degrees; and centers for doctoral training to get ahead. Like the EU, the U.K. also has spawned promising start-ups such as Orca, which announced the world’s smallest quantum computer last year. However, British start-ups may not be able to find sufficient capital to scale, and many are likely to be acquired by the U.S.’s digital giants.
Other countries, such as Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, and Russia are also in the quantum computing race, and could carve out roles for themselves. For instance, Canada is home to several promising startups, such as D-Wave, a leader in annealing computers; while Japan is using public funds to develop a homegrown quantum computer by March 2023. (For an analysis of the comparative standings and challenges that countries face in quantum computing, please see the recent BCG report.)
The four keys to ‘quantum sovereignty’
Meanwhile, the locus of the quantum computing industry is shifting to the challenges of developing applications and adopting the technology. This shift offers countries, especially the follower nations, an opportunity to catch up with the leaders before it’s too late. Governments must use four levers in concert to accelerate their quantum sovereignty:
* Lay the foundations. Governments have to invest more than they currently do if they wish to develop quantum systems over time, even as they strike partnerships to bring home the technology in the short run. Once they have secured the hardware, states must create shared infrastructure to scale the industry. The Netherlands, for instance, has set up Quantum Inspire, a platform that provides users with the hardware to perform quantum computations.
* Coordinate the stakeholders. Governments should use funding and influence to coordinate the work of public and private players, as the U.S. Quantum Coordination Office, for instance, does. In addition, policymakers must connect stakeholders to support the technology’s development. That’s how the U.S. Department of Energy, for instance, came to partner with the University of Chicago; together, they’ve set up an accelerator to connect startups with investors and scientific experts.
* Facilitate the transition. Governments must support business’s transition to the quantum economy. They should offer monetary incentives—such as tax credits, infrastructure assistance, no- or low-interest financing, and free land—so incumbents will shift to quantum technologies quickly. The U.K., for instance, has recently expanded its R&D tax relief scheme to cover investments in quantum technologies.
* Develop the business talent. Instead of developing only academics and scientists, government policies will have to catalyze the creation of a new breed of entrepreneurial and executive talent that can fill key roles in quantum businesses. To speed up the process, Switzerland, for instance, has helped create a master’s program rather than offering only doctoral programs on the subject.
…
Not all general-purpose technologies affect a country’s security and sovereignty as quantum computing does, but they’re all critical for competitiveness. While many countries talk about developing quantum capabilities, their efforts haven’t translated into major advances, as in the U.S. and China. It’s time every government remembered that if it loses the quantum computing race, its technological independence will erode—and, unlike with Schrödinger’s cat, there’s no doubt that its global competitiveness will atrophy.

What is a society with rapidly increasing computational needs to do then? One answer could be to make use of quantum computing, where the quantum nature of molecules themselves are used to process data. A new experiment out of the University of Southern California (USC) might have solved one of the toughest problems in quantum computing, and it did so by building a computer inside a diamond.
This new computer isn’t going to be doing your taxes any time soon, but it shows the viability of solid-state quantum computers to lessen decoherence. Put simply, decoherence is a loss of observable information, which is the last thing you want in a computer. Digital computers are incredibly coherent — if you try to add 1 and 1, you will always get 2 — but due to decoherence, a quantum computer could return almost any result. In past liquid and gas-based systems, researchers often had to deal with decoherence as a consequence of using small, efficient particles.
The diamond computer developed at USC makes use of the impurities in the crystalline structure to make up its two quantum bits, or qubits. The CPUs you’ve always used have transistors that can represent data as a 0 or a 1. A qubit can represent a 0 and a 1 at the same time. This is thanks to the quantum property of superposition, and it’s the property that may one day make quantum computers insanely fast.
Researchers used a neutron as one qubit, and an electron as the other. This mismatched pair was used in order to accurately measure the level of decoherence. An electron, being smaller, is capable of faster calculations, but suffers more from decoherence. Neutrons are slower, but much more stable. In the experiment, scientists found that a series of microwave pulses hitting the diamond computer “reset” the particles and reduced data loss through decoherence.
At this point, there is no practical application for a simple quantum computer, and no real world test to show it working. The team at USC was able to prove that they had indeed built a solid-state quantum computer by supplying it with a simple data set, and applying Grover’s algorithm, which is a mathematical proof demonstrating the potential power of quantum computers. Grover’s algorithm states that a quantum computer will be able to find a specified entry in an unsorted list on the first try, every time.
A human trying to do this would have to go down the list checking each entry to see if it was the right one. Going this route, you would on average check half the list before finding the right entry. This diamond-encrusted computer was able to find the correct choice on the first try 95% of the time, thus proving that the researchers successfully built a functional quantum computer. Cling to your silicon transistors while you can. The next step in computing is getting closer every day.

With multiple waveguide channels (made from standard silicon dioxide), and eight electrodes (see image above), the silicon chip is capable of repeatedly entangling photons. Depending on how the electrodes are programmed, different quantum states can be produced. The end result is two qubits that can be used to perform quantum computing — and unlike D-Wave’s 128-qubit processor (well, depending on who you ask) this is real quantum computing.
Most importantly, though, unlike existing quantum photonic setups which require apparatus the size of a “large dining table,” this new chip is tiny: just 70mm (2.7 inches) by 3mm (pictured below) — not exactly a 22nm component size, then, but small enough to squeeze inside a computer; and really, that’s the whole point. This chip, fundamentally, is like a very basic electronic chip, but for light. This chip, for the first time, brings the possibility of quantum computing to home and mobile computers.
But what can you actually do with quantum entanglement-based computing? That’s the tricky bit; it would be like asking the inventor of the transistor (or telephone) how their creations might impact the world. We know that entanglement can be used for very effective encryption, but beyond that it’s mostly guesswork. There’s general agreement that qubits should allow for faster computation of very complex numbers — think biological processes and weather systems — and early work by Google suggests that pattern recognition might also be a strength of qubits.
With the Bristolian quantum chip now in the wild, though, the capabilities and applications of quantum computing will begin to emerge. Experiments that used to take months to set up and run now take seconds.",1945,"['c378cpw', 'c37ao86', 'c37bwlm', 'c37bxy0', 'c37fbm3', 'c379qic']"

Public-key cryptography systems are currently used to protect everything from emails to online payment transactions, as well as confidential health and financial records. These systems offer end-to-end encryption using two separate keys, one private and one public, that are linked mathematically by complex algorithms that are difficult for computers today to solve.
Although quantum computers are still only a concept, many computer scientists believe that the super-powerful computers will be available within the next 50 years, and that they will be able to solve extremely large numbers quickly, such as seen in recent demonstrations of Shor's algorithm.
Since complex mathematical problems like integer factorisation, discrete logarithm mod primes and elliptic curve discrete logs are essential to public key encryption systems, quantum computing puts them at risk.
Focus on quantum-resistant encryption
The NSA, which developed the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) standard in the 1970s, has long been advising US firms and agencies to use Suite B cryptographic algorithms, which include 3072 bit RSA encryption, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 bit keys and Elliptic Curve P-384 to secure their computer systems.
However, now the NSA is advising companies and government agencies that haven't yet invested in these protections to consider focusing instead on quantum-resistant algorithms. ""Unfortunately, the growth of elliptic curve use has bumped up against the fact of continued progress in the research on quantum computing, which has made it clear that elliptic curve cryptography is not the long-term solution many once hoped it would be. Thus, we have been obligated to update our strategy,"" the NSA said in its release.
""It is important to note that we aren't asking vendors to stop implementing the Suite B algorithms and we aren't asking our national security customers to stop using these algorithms. Rather, we want to give more flexibility to vendors and our customers in the present as we prepare for a quantum safe future.""
NSA seriously worried about quantum computers
The NSA states that companies, particularly those using layered commercial solutions to protect classified national security information, should start implementing key agreement schemes that use large symmetric pre-shared keys – currently the only way to make confidential information quantum-resistant.
Of course, the NSA's reputation hasn't been great with the public since Edward Snowden's revelations, and even before that, the US agency alienated cryptographers when it was discovered in 2013 that its Dual_EC_DRBG standard contained a backdoor allowing NSA to decrypt data.
And yet, the NSA seems to be genuinely worried about what quantum computers could do in the wrong hands. ""Our ultimate goal is to provide cost effective security against a potential quantum computer,"" stressed the NSA.
""We are working with partners across the USG, vendors, and standards bodies to ensure there is a clear plan for getting a new suite of algorithms that are developed in an open and transparent manner that will form the foundation of our next Suite of cryptographic algorithms.""",3417,"['cuey5cy', 'cuev7iv', 'cuf0vk0', 'cuf2ahb', 'cufylek', 'cufgtzc', 'cufmzz3']"

Tucked off a nondescript hallway in IBM’s sprawling and hard-to-find T.J. Watson Research Center an hour north of New York City you’ll find a room with several hanging white cylinders, each surrounded by racks of servers. They’re about the size of fridges—which is exactly what they are. But these fridges cool their insides down to just 0.015 degrees above 0 kelvin, or about -459 degrees Fahrenheit. “We like to say it’s colder than space,” says Jerry Chow, manager of the experimental quantum computing team at IBM Research. They’re so cold because inside, IBM’s latest breakthroughs in quantum computing are hard at work.
At 50 qubits, a quantum computer will be able to run experiments that no traditional computer will be able to emulate, no matter how big or how fast. IBM Research’s fridges today house quantum processors of just five. That’s not nearly enough to replicate many of the tasks we expect of computers today. But each processor can run a complex algorithm or experiment in just a second or two, and churn out results for eight hours before the system needs a refresher. Most importantly, they consistently work. As Chow’s colleague Jay Gambetta, manager of theory of quantum computing and information for Big Blue, explains it: “Quantum isn’t weird or hard, it’s just different.”
Now IBM is giving the keys to one of the quantum processors to the public in the hopes of proving just that. At a new site called the IBM Quantum Experience, researchers and quantum fans will now be able to run their own experiments on one of the research lab’s actual quantum processors hooked up to the cloud. IBM is offering tutorials on quantum mechanics and an interface for easily dragging and dropping operations to create an algorithm to run on the quantum processor. Users can also click a button to simulate the same procedure on a traditional computer to compare hypothetical results with the actual. IBM will keep a log of past experiments so researchers can find similar tests run by peers.
For now, it’s all free, the results of a $3 billion research commitment IBM made in 2014 to develop new computing technologies independent of Moore’s Law. A floor above the quantum lab, other researchers work on tiny carbon nanotubes that could someday replace a silicon chip. IBM’s 5 qubit processors were made possible by a previous breakthrough of using a lattice to arrange five qubits in a way that allowed it to detect quantum errors. But the company still has years of work to get to the universal quantum computer and a potentially massive pay-off for its work.
Besides allowing researchers playing with the IBM quantum processor on the cloud, IBM will also look to create immediate value by inviting its customers to join a new group called the IBM Research Frontiers Institute. Members of the group, which includes Samsung, JSR and Honda, can send scientists to attach to IBM Research’s work groups for several years, while inviting IBM’s top scientists to explore their work. As IBM’s quantum computing research gets closer to a commercial product, those companies would have access to the earliest versions and be able to build on top.
In their massive complex surrounded by forest just north of Chappaqua, IBM’s researchers hope their work will help quantum research become less isolated and more of a collaboration. But IBM Research vice president Dario Gil says that his teams have a mandate to build technologies each decade that change the foundations of computing. “When we do that, we can move the whole company.”",3784,"['d2shcid', 'd2sttva', 'd2sga38', 'd2st7uc', 'd2shcid', 'd2sttva', 'd2sga38', 'd2st7uc']"

This new state, called a quantum spin liquid (QSL), could lead to significant advances in data storage. QSLs also exhibit a quantum phenomenon called long-range entanglement, which could lead to new types of communications systems, and more.
Generally, when we talk about magnetism’s role in the realm of technology, there are just two types: Ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Ferromagnetism has been known about for centuries, and is the underlying force behind your compass’s spinning needle or the permanent bar magnets you played with at school. In ferromagnets, the spin (i.e. charge) of every electron is aligned in the same direction, causing two distinct poles. In antiferromagnets, neighboring electrons point in the opposite direction, causing the object to have zero net magnetism (pictured below). In combination with ferromagnets, antiferromagnets are used to create spin valves: the magnetic sensors used in hard drive heads.
In the case of quantum spin liquids, the material is a solid crystal — but the internal magnetic state is constantly in flux. The magnetic orientations of the electrons (their magnetic moment) fluctuate as they interact with other nearby electrons. “But there is a strong interaction between them, and due to quantum effects, they don’t lock in place,” says Young Lee, senior author of the research. It is these strong interactions that apparently allow for long-range quantum entanglement.
The existence of QSLs has been theorized since 1987, but until now no one has succeeded in actually finding one. In MIT’s case, the researchers spent 10 months growing a tiny sliver of herbertsmithite (pictured above) — a material that was suspected to be a QSL, but which had never been properly investigated. (Bonus points if you can guess who herbertsmithite is named after.) Using neutron scattering — firing a beam of neutrons at a material to analyze its structure — the researchers found that the herbertsmithite was indeed a QSL.
Moving forward, Lee says that the discovery of QSLs could lead to advances in data storage (new forms of magnetic storage) and communications (long-range entanglement). Lee also seems to think that QSLs could lead us towards higher-temperature superconductors — i.e. materials that superconduct under relatively normal conditions, rather than -200C.
Really, though, the most exciting thing about quantum spin liquids is that they’re completely new, and thus we ultimately have no idea how they might eventually affect our world. “We have to get a more comprehensive understanding of the big picture,” Lee says. “There is no theory that describes everything that we’re seeing.”

The matter phase relies on a quirk of the Fibonacci sequence to remain in a quantum state for longer.
Just as ordinary matter can be in a solid, liquid, gas, or superheated plasmic phase (or state), quantum materials also have phases. The phase refers to how the matter is structured on an atomic level—the arrangement of its atoms or its electrons, for example. Several years ago, physicists discovered a quantum supersolid, and last year, a team confirmed the existence of quantum spin liquids, a long-suspected phase of quantum matter, in a simulator. The recent team thinks they’ve discovered another new phase.
Quantum bits, or qubits, are like ordinary computer bits in that their values can be 0 or 1, but they can also be 0 or 1 simultaneously, a state of ambiguity that allows the computers to consider many possible solutions to a problem much faster than an ordinary computer. Quantum computers should eventually be able to solve problems that classical computers can’t.
Qubits are often atoms; in the recent case, the researchers used 10 ytterbium ions, which were controlled by electric fields and manipulated using laser pulses. When multiple qubits’ states can be described in relation to one another, the qubits are considered entangled. Quantum entanglement is a delicate agreement between multiple qubits in a system, and the agreement is dissolved the moment any one of those bits’ values is certain. At that moment, the system decoheres, and the quantum operation falls apart.
A big challenge of quantum computing is maintaining the quantum state of qubits. The slightest fluctuations in temperature, vibrations, or electromagnetic fields can cause the supersensitive qubits to decohere and their calculations to fall apart. Since the longer the qubits stay quantum, the more you can get done, making computers’ quantum states persist for as long as possible is a crucial step for the field.
In the recent research, pulsing a laser periodically at the 10 ytterbium qubits kept them in a quantum state—meaning entangled—for 1.5 seconds. But when the researchers pulsed the lasers in the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence, they found that the qubits on the edge of the system remained in a quantum state for about 5.5 seconds, the entire length of the experiment (the qubits could have remained in a quantum state for longer, but the team ended the experiment at the 5.5-second mark). Their research was published this summer in Nature.
You can think of the Fibonacci sequence laser pulses as two frequencies that never overlap. That makes the pulses a quasicrystal: a pattern that has order, but no periodicity.
“The key result in my mind was showing the difference between these two different ways to engineer these quantum states and how one was better at protecting it from errors than the other,” said study co-author Justin Bohnet, a quantum engineer at Quantinuum, the company whose computer was used in the recent experiment.
The Fibonacci sequence is a numeric pattern in which each number is the sum of the two previous numbers (so 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). Its history goes back over 2,000 years and is connected to the so-called golden ratio. Now, the unique series may have quantum implications.
“It turns out that if you engineer laser pulses in the correct way, your quantum system can have symmetries that come from time translation,” said Philipp Dumitrescu, the paper’s lead author and a quantum physicist who conducted the work while at the Flatiron Institute. A time-translation symmetry means that an experiment will yield the same result, regardless of whether it takes place today, tomorrow, or 100 years from now.
“What we realized is that by using quasi-periodic sequences based on the Fibonacci pattern, you can have the system behave as if there are two distinct directions of time,” Dumitrescu added.
Shooting the qubits with laser pulses with a periodic (a simple A-B-A-B) pattern didn’t prolong the system’s quantum state. But by pulsing the laser in a Fibonacci sequence (A-AB-ABA-ABAAB, and so on), the researchers gave the qubits a non-repeating, or quasi-periodic, pattern.
It’s similar to the quasicrystals from the Trinity nuclear test site, but instead of being a three-dimensional quasicrystal, the physicists made a quasicrystal in time. In both cases, symmetries that exist at higher dimensions can be projected in a lower dimension, like the tessellated patterns in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling.
“With this quasi-periodic sequence, there’s a complicated evolution that cancels out all the errors that live on the edge,” Dumitrescu said in a Simons Foundation release. By on the edge, he’s referring to the qubits farthest from the center of their configuration at any one time. “Because of that, the edge stays quantum-mechanically coherent much, much longer than you’d expect.” The Fibonacci-pattern laser pulses made the edge qubits more robust.
More robust, longer-lived quantum systems are a vital need for the future of quantum computing. If it takes shooting qubits with a very specific mathematical rhythm of laser pulses to keep a quantum computer in an entangled state, then physicists had better start blasting.",5357,"['it23h0u', 'it1zs7i', 'it1y3dd', 'it1zk5w', 'it21pzt', 'it1yhq4', 'it29lno', 'it3u6eu', 'it247bm', 'it1zb6b', 'it26w15', 'it51vki', 'it3ug6t', 'it2bdr6', 'it28hi1', 'it3m7ae', 'it23afk', 'it2d00q', 'it2i6z3', 'it2pw9u', 'it2v1ao', 'it2v3tp', 'it30dqs', 'it318pc', 'it32ekg', 'it3a76q', 'it3aeu2', 'it3dps5', 'it3etdy', 'it3g0je', 'it3noyy', 'it41cjd', 'it4gk6m', 'it6tdq6', 'iu2z87g', 'it34u24', 'it21utg', 'it2pim2', 'it2tm8e', 'it2zzuo', 'it24brw', 'it2e1g1', 'it2v3wa', 'it37jga', 'it3i8nd', 'it23oql', 'it3eze3', 'it2focq', 'it2x49w', 'it37ez6', 'it39ytm', 'it3fpj5', 'it3gpc2', 'it3hl8q', 'it3j1oa', 'it3jfnk', 'it3kdoj', 'it3mfxi', 'it3tm7z', 'it3y6w3', 'it46qs9', 'it4c2lp', 'it4gqcj', 'it4jb1r', 'it4ko9w', 'it4oa9h', 'it4qjyc', 'it4t4s3', 'it4tyyo', 'it54c0a', 'it57oaa', 'it5tcxz', 'it5vv2v', 'it5w2bn', 'it61qlm', 'it2j0mb', 'it2xujm', 'it2yy0l']"

Qubits are often atoms; in the recent case, the researchers used 10 ytterbium ions, which were controlled by electric fields and manipulated using laser pulses. When multiple qubits’ states can be described in relation to one another, the qubits are considered entangled. Quantum entanglement is a delicate agreement between multiple qubits in a system, and the agreement is dissolved the moment any one of those bits’ values is certain. At that moment, the system decoheres, and the quantum operation falls apart.
A big challenge of quantum computing is maintaining the quantum state of qubits. The slightest fluctuations in temperature, vibrations, or electromagnetic fields can cause the supersensitive qubits to decohere and their calculations to fall apart. Since the longer the qubits stay quantum, the more you can get done, making computers’ quantum states persist for as long as possible is a crucial step for the field.

In the recent research, pulsing a laser periodically at the 10 ytterbium qubits kept them in a quantum state—meaning entangled—for 1.5 seconds. But when the researchers pulsed the lasers in the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence, they found that the qubits on the edge of the system remained in a quantum state for about 5.5 seconds, the entire length of the experiment (the qubits could have remained in a quantum state for longer, but the team ended the experiment at the 5.5-second mark). Their research was published this summer in Nature.
You can think of the Fibonacci sequence laser pulses as two frequencies that never overlap. That makes the pulses a quasicrystal: a pattern that has order, but no periodicity.

“The key result in my mind was showing the difference between these two different ways to engineer these quantum states and how one was better at protecting it from errors than the other,” said study co-author Justin Bohnet, a quantum engineer at Quantinuum, the company whose computer was used in the recent experiment.
The Fibonacci sequence is a numeric pattern in which each number is the sum of the two previous numbers (so 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). Its history goes back over 2,000 years and is connected to the so-called golden ratio. Now, the unique series may have quantum implications.

“It turns out that if you engineer laser pulses in the correct way, your quantum system can have symmetries that come from time translation,” said Philipp Dumitrescu, the paper’s lead author and a quantum physicist who conducted the work while at the Flatiron Institute. A time-translation symmetry means that an experiment will yield the same result, regardless of whether it takes place today, tomorrow, or 100 years from now.
“What we realized is that by using quasi-periodic sequences based on the Fibonacci pattern, you can have the system behave as if there are two distinct directions of time,” Dumitrescu added.

Shooting the qubits with laser pulses with a periodic (a simple A-B-A-B) pattern didn’t prolong the system’s quantum state. But by pulsing the laser in a Fibonacci sequence (A-AB-ABA-ABAAB, and so on), the researchers gave the qubits a non-repeating, or quasi-periodic, pattern.
It’s similar to the quasicrystals from the Trinity nuclear test site, but instead of being a three-dimensional quasicrystal, the physicists made a quasicrystal in time. In both cases, symmetries that exist at higher dimensions can be projected in a lower dimension, like the tessellated patterns in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling.

“With this quasi-periodic sequence, there’s a complicated evolution that cancels out all the errors that live on the edge,” Dumitrescu said in a Simons Foundation release. By on the edge, he’s referring to the qubits farthest from the center of their configuration at any one time. “Because of that, the edge stays quantum-mechanically coherent much, much longer than you’d expect.” The Fibonacci-pattern laser pulses made the edge qubits more robust.
More robust, longer-lived quantum systems are a vital need for the future of quantum computing. If it takes shooting qubits with a very specific mathematical rhythm of laser pulses to keep a quantum computer in an entangled state, then physicists had better start blasting.

Instead, the patent that Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd had published is one on quantum computing, the next revolutionary step of how our technology will run in the next 10 years.
The patent is listed as patent number CN114613758A, and from the patent listing, Huawei has developed a type of “quantum chipset and quantum computing device”.
Huawei’s new type of quantum computing device aims to solve the current issues of producing quantum chipsets which include the complexity of manufacturing a quantum chipset and the low yields of the quantum chipsets when compared to the existing mainstream computing chipsets of today. In turn, with this new type of quantum chip, not only will it be easier to assemble in the future but also more units can be successfully produced with higher yields, meaning adopting more market share in the industry.
In the patent listing, it states the fundamentals of the architecture of Huawei’s newly developed quantum chipset:
- A substrate, M sub-chips, a coupling structure and a cavity mode suppression structure
- Each sub-chip includes N qubits, and M sub-chips are arranged on the surface of the substrate at intervals
- The coupling structure is used to realize the interconnection between the M sub-chips
- The cavity mode suppression structure is arranged at the edge of each sub-chip and/or in the gap between the M sub-chips and is used for increasing the cavity mode frequency of the quantum chip.
Here, the term M and N refers to a positive integer. ‘M’ is greater than 1, meanwhile, ‘N’ is greater or equal to 1.
The M sub-chips in the quantum chip will reduce the strain of manufacturing and will improve the production yield. For example, when a sub-chip happens to suffer from a defect, only the sub-chip will be discarded, and the overall chipset can be fixed or reused to prevent it from further being more electronic waste.
Quantum computing, heralded as the next generation of computing aims to cut down on the Internet and computing speeds up to 10 times that of today. For example, let’s say a modern-day supercomputer took 108 days (3 months) to compute 62.8 trillion digits of pi, if we were to theoretically use a future quantum computer, it could hypothetically calculate 62.8 trillion digits of pi in only 10 days (1.5 weeks), which is much faster than 3 months.
Although we are still in the infancy stages of developing the future of quantum computers, the promise of quantum computing seems attractively limitless with faster internet searching, lightning-quick financial data analysis, shorter commutes, more effective cancer drugs, better weather prediction and more.

The use of quantum computing is a big deal because as we depend more on computing, we’re going to need different types of processors. Lockheed’s commercial use suggests that the probabilistic problem-solving approach and breakneck speed of quantum computing could be more widely adopted in the near future.
For the record, D-Wave and Lockheed formed their commercial relationship a couple of years ago, although at the time the defense contractor apparently didn’t discuss possible applications. Now there are some specifics on how Lockheed could employ its D-Wave computer, following projections on other types of applications.
Lockheed Martin will use its D-Wave computer “to create and test complex radar, space and aircraft systems,” the Times’ Quentin Hardy wrote. “It could be possible, for example, to tell instantly how the millions of lines of software running a network satellites would react to a solar burst or a pulse from a nuclear explosion — something that can now take weeks, if ever, to determine.”
Rather than working with binary yes-or-no questions — ones and zeros — quantum computing is more probabilistic, also allowing a combination of zero and one to simultaneously answer many questions with quantum bits of information, or qubits, and tell users more about the likelihood of a situation. It’s not necessarily useful for all kinds of computing, but it could solve problems that current computers can’t.
It’s also a great way forward for computing to keep following the spirit of Moore’s Law, in the sense that it could permit more powerful computing than what’s possible today. The question is how soon it will become commercially viable. The quantum computer cost Lockheed $10 million, according to one report, so it will take some time and more commercial interest before the price can come down.
Commercial applications of quantum computing are a long time coming. In a 2010 GigaOM Research report on quantum computing (subscription required), my colleague Stacey Higginbotham wrote that commercial viability could take decades, not years.

On Monday, the company unveiled Eagle, a 127 qubit quantum processor. IBM claims it’s the first such processor that can’t be simulated by a classical supercomputer. To make sense of what that means, the company says to simulate Eagle you would need more classical bits than there are atoms in every human being on the planet. IBM is crediting the breakthrough to a new design that puts the processor’s control components on multiple physical levels while the qubits are located on a single layer. It’s a design the company says allows for a significant increase in computing power.
One aspect of Eagle the company isn’t talking about at the moment is quantum volume. Cointed by IBM, it’s a metric that attempts to measure the performance of a quantum computer by taking a holistic view of its different parts. Not only does it take into account qubits, but also the way in which they interact with one another. The higher the quantum volume, the more capable a quantum computer is at tackling difficult problems.
“Our first 127-qubit Eagle processor is available as an exploratory system on the IBM Cloud to select members of the IBM Quantum Network,” Jerry Chow, the director of IBM’s Quantum Hardware System Development unit, told Engadget. “Exploratory systems are early access to our latest technologies and so we do not guarantee uptime or a particular level of repeatable performance, as measured by quantum volume.”
Without knowing the quantum volume of the Eagle processor, it’s hard to say exactly how it compares to what's out there already. Last October, Honeywell claimed its System Model H1 had a quantum volume of 128 with just 10 connected qubits. For reference, earlier in the year IBM announced a 27 qubit system with a then industry-leading quantum volume of 64. Clearly, the company’s new processor is powerful, but qubits don’t tell the whole story here.
What’s also notable about Eagle is that IBM is not claiming quantum supremacy. According to the company, it’s a step toward that milestone, but the processor is not yet at the point where it can solve problems that classical computers cannot. In 2019, Google sparked controversy when it (briefly) claimed it had achieved the feat with its Sycamore system. At the time, IBM called the company’s claims “indefensible” based on the fact Google built the computer to solve one specific equation.
IBM will make Eagle available to select members of its Quantum Network starting next month.",2533,"['hkqpj5o', 'hkprut2', 'hkqarnb', 'hkpxddb', 'hkqemup', 'hkq8wee', 'hkqlq3d', 'hkqcpla', 'hkpp0va', 'hkrc585', 'hksjyhn', 'hkt1j75', 'hkr8sq5', 'hkqpj5o', 'hkprut2', 'hkqarnb', 'hkpxddb', 'hkqemup', 'hkq8wee', 'hkqlq3d', 'hkqcpla', 'hkpp0va', 'hkrc585', 'hksjyhn', 'hkt1j75', 'hkr8sq5']"

IBM has come up with a way to simulate quantum computers that have 56 quantum bits, or qubits, on a non-quantum supercomputer – a task previously thought to be impossible. The feat moves the goalposts in the fight for quantum supremacy, the effort to outstrip classical computers using quantum ones.
It used to be widely accepted that a classical computer cannot simulate more than 49 qubits because of memory limitations. The memory required for simulations increases exponentially with each additional qubit.
The closest anyone had come to putting the 49-qubit limit to a test was a 45-qubit simulation at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, which needed 500 terabytes of memory. IBM’s new simulation upends the assumption by simulating 56 qubits with only 4.5 terabytes.

The simulation is based on a mathematical trick that allows a more compact numerical representation of different arrangements of qubits, known as quantum states.
A quantum computing operation is typically represented by a table of numbers indicating what should be done to each qubit to produce a new quantum state. Instead, researchers at IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, used tensors – effectively multidimensional tables augmented with axes beyond rows and columns.
Thanks to the additional axes, much more information can be squashed into a few tensors, so long as we know how to write it down in the language of tensors. The researchers found a way to do just that for quantum computing operations.
Embarrassingly parallel
While writing down the operations in tensor form, they also found out a way to divide the simulation task into what they call “embarrassingly parallel” chunks, which allowed them to use the many processors of a supercomputer simultaneously. This won them the final bit of efficiency needed to simulate a 56-qubit quantum computer.
“IBM pushed the envelope,” says Itay Hen at the University of Southern California. “It’s going to be much harder for quantum-device people to exhibit [quantum] supremacy.”
IBM now has a functional 56-qubit quantum computer living in their supercomputer. But while that’s an improvement on the previous record, Andrew Childs at the University of Maryland says it’s not a huge leap forward. “I don’t think they’re claiming that this is going to give them an efficient simulation of quantum systems on a classical computer,” he says.
Even so, they’ve upped the ante in the race to outperform classical computers with quantum systems. Google previously said they were on track to build a working 49-qubit processor by the end of 2017, but that will no longer win them the achievement of quantum supremacy.
Bob Wisnieff, the principal investigator of the IBM study, says their current simulation runs about “a billion times slower” than the theoretical estimates for an actual 56-qubit quantum computer.
Wisnieff’s team plans to experiment with supercomputers whose processors can communicate efficiently with one another. They expect to be able to squeeze out a few more qubits from these communication channels, which help speed up the parallel computation needed for the simulation.
IBM’s goal is to build a quantum computer that can “explore practical problems” such as quantum chemistry, says Wisnieff. He hopes to check the accuracy of quantum computers against his simulations before putting real quantum computers to the test.
“I want to be able to write algorithms that I know the answers for before I run them on a real quantum computer,” he says.

The 16-qubit computer will be available to developers and researchers at no cost through the IBM Cloud service. The 17-qubit quantum computer will be sold as a prototype commercial product to other companies.
A qubit is the basic unit of information in a quantum computer, as well as the quantum equivalent of a ""bit"" in the conventional computing world. However, instead of having a value of either 0 or 1, it can have 0, 1, or both values at the same time. This is called ""superposition,"" and it's a fundamental property of quantum computing.
Towards Quantum Supremacy
IBM and Google believe that “quantum supremacy,” or the moment when quantum computers will solve at least some problems faster than the fastest supercomputers on Earth, will be achieved when we can build a quantum computer with around 50 qubits. Both companies plan to have such a computer ready in the next few years.
So far most universal quantum computers have been stuck at five or fewer qubits, with Google being one of the few to break apart with its nine-qubit quantum computer (opens in new tab). Google’s computer was also able to demonstrate one of the first practical applications of universal quantum computers by accurately simulating a hydrogen H2 molecule.
Although we don’t know yet if Google has further upgraded its quantum computer since it last talked about the nine-qubit one, IBM seems to have one-upped Google this time with 16- and 17-qubit quantum computers.
IBM’s New Quantum Computers
The 16-qubit quantum computer will allow more complex experimentation than its previous five-qubit system, according to IBM. It will be freely accessible to developers, programmers, and researchers who want to run quantum algorithms, work with individual qubits, or explore tutorials and simulations. Beta access is available through the IBM Quantum Experience program, and a new software development kit (SDK) is available on GitHub.
The 17-qubit quantum computer leverages significant improvements in materials, device, and architecture to make it IBM’s most powerful universal quantum computer. The chip is still a prototype but it will be offered for sale to interested businesses looking to do a quantum leap (get it?) over their competitors.
""The significant engineering improvements announced today will allow IBM to scale future processors to include 50 or more qubits, and demonstrate computational capabilities beyond today’s classical computing systems,” said Arvind Krishna, senior vice president and director of IBM Research and Hybrid Cloud. “These powerful upgrades to our quantum systems, delivered via the IBM Cloud, allow us to imagine new applications and new frontiers for discovery that are virtually unattainable using classical computers alone,” he added.
Quantum Volume
Although IBM seems to already be ahead of everyone else when it comes to the number of quits in universal quantum computers--with the exception of D-Wave’s 2,000 qubit system, which is not a universal quantum computer--it noted that the number of qubits isn’t the most important factor, or, rather, not the only factor that matters.
Due to the fragile nature of quantum information, the quality of the qubits, how they talk to each other, and minimizing quantum errors are even more important when it comes to increasing the computational power of a quantum system.
This is why IBM has adopted a new metric, which it calls “quantum volume,” to measure the computational power of quantum computers. According to the company, the quantum volume metric accounts for the number and quality of qubits, circuit connectivity, and error rates of operations. IBM also noted that its 17-qubit prototype offers a significant improvement in quantum volume over previous quantum computers.
Over the next few years, IBM plans to increase the quantum volume of its qubits even more aggressively by improving all aspects of its quantum processors, including increasing their qubit number to 50 or more.",4067,"['dhptmfv', 'dhpzfa0', 'dhpxlc1', 'dhpz1hr', 'dhq313z', 'dhq2831', 'dhq9jry', 'dhqb4w3', 'dhqe7qs', 'dhq4hnc', 'dhptmfv', 'dhpzfa0', 'dhpxlc1', 'dhpz1hr', 'dhq313z', 'dhq2831', 'dhq9jry', 'dhqb4w3', 'dhqe7qs', 'dhq4hnc']"

According to a new blog post (opens in new tab) from IBM Quantum, the company's researchers have, for the first time ever, reported a simultaneous proof along with experimental verification of a new kind of quantum advantage. Specifically they showed that even today's noisy qubits offer “more value than bits as a medium of storage during computations”.
IBM's quantum team thinks of computing in terms of circuits and at the start of a circuit, there are a number of classical or quantum bits. These bits are set to an initial value and then the circuit progresses forward through a user-written program, made up of gates. While different gates have different effects on these bits, the output of this kind of circuit is a set of zeroes and ones in both the classical and quantum case.

Demonstrating the advantage
In their new academic paper published in Nature Physics titled “Quantum advantage for computations with limited space (opens in new tab)”, IBM Quantum's researchers set out to prove the advantage quantum computers have over classical computers.
They did this by setting up an experiment using circuits restricted to using two-input gates and limited to using one bit of computational/scrap space to answer the question: “How does the computational power differ when a computer has access to classical scratch space versus quantum scratch space?"".
IBM's researchers then proved in their paper that there are functions which a restricted classical computer (opens in new tab) cannot compute but a restricted quantum computer can. To do so, they pitted a real quantum computer against a classical computer.
In order to increase the computational capabilities of the classical computer used in their experiment, the researchers armed it with access to random Boolean (opens in new tab) gates. However, even with access to this randomness, the classical computer was still only able to succeed 87.5 percent of the time while a perfect, noiseless quantum computer would be able to succeed 100 percent of the time according to the findings of IBM's paper.
While today's quantum computers are too noisy to achieve this kind of perfect result, IBM Quantum's researchers still managed to achieve a success rate of 93 percent and beat the classical system when carrying out the experiment in real-life by calibrating special entangling gates to perform these circuits more efficiently.

That'll let users run computations with a ""field-leading"" 90 microseconds of coherence, allowing ""high-fidelity quantum operations,"" IBM says.
Quantum computers work much differently than regular supercomputers, taking advantage of weird quantum physics principals like ""superposition."" In theory, they can run specific programs, like encryption-cracking algorithms, many, many times faster than regular computers.

Before it sets about building the biggest quantum computer to date, IBM plans release its 433-qubit Osprey chip later this year and migrate the Qiskit Runtime to the cloud in 2023, “bringing a serverless approach into the core quantum software stack,” per Wednesday’s release. Those products will be followed later that year by Condor, a quantum chip IBM is billing as “the world’s first universal quantum processor with over 1,000 qubits.”
This rapid four-fold jump in quantum volume (the number of qubits packed into a processor) will enable users to run increasingly longer quantum circuits, while increasing the processing speed — measured in CLOPS (circuit layer operations per second) — from a maximum of 2,900 OPS to over 10,000. Then it’s just a simple matter of quadrupaling that capacity in the span of less than 24 months.
To do so, IBM plans to first get sets of multiple processors to communicate with one another both in parallel and in series. This should help develop better error mitigation schemes and improve coordination between processors, both necessary components of tomorrow’s practical quantum computers. After that, IBM will design and deploy chip-level couplers, which “will closely connect multiple chips together to effectively form a single and larger processor,” according to the company, then build quantum communication links to connect those larger multi-processors together into even bigger clusters — essentially daisy-chaining increasingly larger clumps of processors together until they form a functional, modular 4,000-qubit computing platform.
“As quantum computing matures, we’re starting to see ourselves as more than quantum hardware,” IBM researcher Jay Gambetta wrote on Wednesday. “We’re building the next generation of computing. In order to benefit from our world-leading hardware, we need to develop the software and infrastructure capable of taking advantage of it.”
As such, IBM released a set of ready-made primitive programs earlier this year, “pre-built programs that allows developers easy access to the outputs of quantum computations without requiring intricate understanding of the hardware,” per the company. IBM intends to expand that program set in 2023, enabling developers to run them on parallelized quantum processors. “We also plan to enhance primitive performance with low-level compilation and post-processing methods, like introducing error suppression and mitigation tools,” Gambetta said. “These advanced primitives will allow algorithm developers to use Qiskit Runtime services as an API for incorporating quantum circuits and classical routines to build quantum workflows.”
These workflows will take a given problem, break it down into smaller quantum and classical programs, chew through those processes in either parallel or series depending on which is more efficient, and then use an orchestration layer to “circuit stitch” all those various data streams back into a coherent result that classical computers can understand. IBM calls its proprietary stitching infrastructure Quantum Serverless and, per the new roadmap, will deploy the feature to its core quantum software stack in 2023.
“We think by next year, we’ll begin prototyping quantum software applications for users hoping to use Qiskit Runtime and Quantum Serverless to address specific use cases,” Gambetta said. We’ll begin to define these services with our first test case — machine learning — working with partners to accelerate the path toward useful quantum software applications. By 2025, we think model developers will be able to explore quantum applications in machine learning, optimization, finance, natural sciences, and beyond.”
“For many years, CPU-centric supercomputers were society’s processing workhorse, with IBM serving as a key developer of these systems,” he continued. “In the last few years, we’ve seen the emergence of AI-centric supercomputers, where CPUs and GPUs work together in giant systems to tackle AI-heavy workloads. Now, IBM is ushering in the age of the quantum-centric supercomputer, where quantum resources — QPUs — will be woven together with CPUs and GPUs into a compute fabric. We think that the quantum-centric supercomputer will serve as an essential technology for those solving the toughest problems, those doing the most ground-breaking research, and those developing the most cutting-edge technology.”

Tucked off a nondescript hallway in IBM’s sprawling and hard-to-find T.J. Watson Research Center an hour north of New York City you’ll find a room with several hanging white cylinders, each surrounded by racks of servers. They’re about the size of fridges—which is exactly what they are. But these fridges cool their insides down to just 0.015 degrees above 0 kelvin, or about -459 degrees Fahrenheit. “We like to say it’s colder than space,” says Jerry Chow, manager of the experimental quantum computing team at IBM Research. They’re so cold because inside, IBM’s latest breakthroughs in quantum computing are hard at work.
At 50 qubits, a quantum computer will be able to run experiments that no traditional computer will be able to emulate, no matter how big or how fast. IBM Research’s fridges today house quantum processors of just five. That’s not nearly enough to replicate many of the tasks we expect of computers today. But each processor can run a complex algorithm or experiment in just a second or two, and churn out results for eight hours before the system needs a refresher. Most importantly, they consistently work. As Chow’s colleague Jay Gambetta, manager of theory of quantum computing and information for Big Blue, explains it: “Quantum isn’t weird or hard, it’s just different.”
Now IBM is giving the keys to one of the quantum processors to the public in the hopes of proving just that. At a new site called the IBM Quantum Experience, researchers and quantum fans will now be able to run their own experiments on one of the research lab’s actual quantum processors hooked up to the cloud. IBM is offering tutorials on quantum mechanics and an interface for easily dragging and dropping operations to create an algorithm to run on the quantum processor. Users can also click a button to simulate the same procedure on a traditional computer to compare hypothetical results with the actual. IBM will keep a log of past experiments so researchers can find similar tests run by peers.
For now, it’s all free, the results of a $3 billion research commitment IBM made in 2014 to develop new computing technologies independent of Moore’s Law. A floor above the quantum lab, other researchers work on tiny carbon nanotubes that could someday replace a silicon chip. IBM’s 5 qubit processors were made possible by a previous breakthrough of using a lattice to arrange five qubits in a way that allowed it to detect quantum errors. But the company still has years of work to get to the universal quantum computer and a potentially massive pay-off for its work.
Besides allowing researchers playing with the IBM quantum processor on the cloud, IBM will also look to create immediate value by inviting its customers to join a new group called the IBM Research Frontiers Institute. Members of the group, which includes Samsung, JSR and Honda, can send scientists to attach to IBM Research’s work groups for several years, while inviting IBM’s top scientists to explore their work. As IBM’s quantum computing research gets closer to a commercial product, those companies would have access to the earliest versions and be able to build on top.
In their massive complex surrounded by forest just north of Chappaqua, IBM’s researchers hope their work will help quantum research become less isolated and more of a collaboration. But IBM Research vice president Dario Gil says that his teams have a mandate to build technologies each decade that change the foundations of computing. “When we do that, we can move the whole company.”",3784,"['d2shcid', 'd2sttva', 'd2sga38', 'd2st7uc', 'd2shcid', 'd2sttva', 'd2sga38', 'd2st7uc']"

The headlines have been incredible. Newsweek (Scientists Have Reversed Time in a Quantum Computer), Discover (Scientists Used IBM’s Quantum Computer to Reverse Time, Possibly Breaking a Law of Physics) and the UK’s Independent newspaper (Scientists ‘Reverse Time’ With Quantum Computer in Breakthrough Study). Cosmopolitan magazine also chimed in: Scientists just turned back time and it’s like Back to the Future is coming true. There are many, many more.
The trigger for all of these was a Scientific Reports paper with the provocative title “Arrow of time and its reversal on the IBM quantum computer.” In it, the authors claimed to have performed an experiment that opens up lines of research, in their words, toward “investigating time reversal and the backward time flow.”
If you had difficulty understanding how scientists accomplished such a counterintuitive feat, don’t worry. They didn’t.
Some simple physical models are symmetric in time. Think of an idealized version of the Earth orbiting the sun, where each is a perfect sphere. Look at that system going forward in time, and the Earth orbits in a clockwise direction. “Reverse” time and instead the Earth will travel in a counterclockwise orbit. Both are equally realistic. Or think of two billiard balls colliding. You can run the video in either direction and it still seems physically plausible.
The real world is not that way. Things look different going forward in time from how they would were time reversed—in a number of different ways, among them that entropy (very loosely speaking, a measure of disorder) increases. This is a law both of physics and of common sense. (For a fun and sad exploration of how strange reversing the flow of time would make things, check out Time’s Arrow by Martin Amis. And if you really want to get into the weeds on the physics of time travel, try here.)
So if they didn’t invent time travel, what did these scientists actually do?
Think about pressing rewind on a video. That “reverses the flow of time,” in a way. If you’ve never seen it before, it’s kind of neat. It might let you see things—like steam flowing back into a tea kettle or Humpty Dumpty spontaneously assembling from a jumble of broken pieces—that appear to “reverse the arrow of time.” The paper in question describes a quantum-computing version of such a video running in reverse.
A closer analogy is a lens, like what one would find in a telescope, a microscope, or eyeglasses. A lens can be used to focus light—“reversing” the dispersal of light that had gone out of focus. The authors of the paper, from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, and ETH Zurich, say their technique might be useful for testing quantum programs. This is correct. But it’s a lot less interesting than a time machine.
As Scott Aaronson, director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas at Austin, says, “If you’re simulating a time-reversible process on your computer, then you can ‘reverse the direction of time’ by simply reversing the direction of your simulation. From a quick look at the paper, I confess that I didn’t understand how this becomes more profound if the simulation is being done on IBM’s quantum computer.”
Other quantum computing experts we spoke to agreed. One, who did not wish to be named, said: “I don’t know how useful this is … it doesn’t mean that these guys made a time machine. They certainly didn’t violate the laws of thermodynamics or the laws of physics.” He added: “This is the type of hype that is going to give quantum computing a bad name.”
He’s right. Wild headlines don’t just give quantum computing a bad name. They do damage to science as a whole by convincing the public that science is so bewildering it’s beyond their comprehension. It’s tough enough to explain the paradoxes that actually exist in quantum mechanics without sensationalist embellishment. Time, whether any of us likes it or not, marches on.
This article was originally published under the headline: ""No, IBM didn’t just 'reverse time' with a quantum computer."" While this is accurate, the headline was modified to reflect the fact that though the researchers in question used publicly-available IBM quantum computing facilities, they are not affiliated with the company.

Published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers found that 'wave-particle duality' is just a different manifestation of the quantum 'uncertainty principle'.
Still confused?
Wave-particle duality is the idea that a quantum object could behave like a wave. However, the wave behaviour disappears if you try to locate it.
It can be seen when single particles are fired one by one at a screen containing two narrow slits – the particles pile up behind the slits as a stripy pattern like you would expect from waves, not in two heaps as classical objects would. However, when you look at which slit a particle goes through the interference pattern vanishes.
Quantum uncertainty says that it is impossible to know certain pairs of things about a quantum particle at once ie the more you know the position of an atom, the less able you are to know the speed it is moving. The principle is a limit on the knowability of nature.
Researchers from the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore note that these two concepts have been part of quantum physics for over 100 years.
Researcher Patrick Coles said: ""We were guided by a gut feeling, and only a gut feeling, that there should be a connection.""
The scientists are all experts on equations that reveal how much can be learned about pairs of properties affected by the uncertainty principle. These are known as 'entropic uncertainty relations'.
They discovered that all the maths previously used to describe wave-particle duality can be reformulated in terms of these relations.
Stephanie Wehner explained: ""The connection between uncertainty and wave-particle duality comes out very naturally when you consider them as questions about what information you can gain about a system. Our result highlights the power of thinking about physics from the perspective of information.""
Coles added: ""It was like we had discovered the 'Rosetta Stone' that connected two different languages. The literature on wave-particle duality was like hieroglyphics that we could now translate into our native tongue. We had several eureka moments when we finally understood what people had done.""
The authors say their discovery gives a greater insight into quantum physics and will allow for new ideas for wave-particle duality applications.",2472,"['cn0p5xd', 'cn0kmap', 'cn0tklz', 'cn0n8f6', 'cn0sccv', 'cn107ps', 'cn0nksc', 'cn0vr84', 'cn0ixom']"

The technology would allow information to be “transported” in an instant. It would help bring about a promised quantum computing revolution as well as bringing radical change in how networks function.
But, to get there, scientists must first figure out the basic technology so that it can be used in more complex networks.
Now scientists say they have done some of that fundamental work, in a new study that reports a success in teleporting quantum information between two nodes of a network that are not connected to each other.
In the study, scientists created a three-node quantum network, giving each of those nodes a name: Alice, Bob and Charlie. In the network, Alice was connected to Bob, and Bob was connected to Charlie – but Charlie was not connected to Bob.
Scientists say they have successfully shared information between Alice and Bob, despite the fact they are not connected.
So far, researchers have only been able to demonstrate connections between neighbouring nodes, and the new study represents the first success of this kind.
Now scientists hope it represents a first step towards building a larger quantum network built on the sharing of quantum information.
That future is still “some way off”, researchers away from the new study say. But the paper offers a “potential path forward” to building real world applications of the technology.
“This achievement is not only a win for fundamental science, but also represents an advance in the real-world problem solving required to move this fascinating quantum application to the next step,” write Oliver Slattery and Yong-Su Kim in an accompanying article.
Actually building such systems will require more robust systems, as well as new interfaces that should improve the efficiency of the system.
That will be crucial to bring the breakthroughs in the work to more complex quantum systems, the authors say.

Researchers at DTU Fotonik have successfully teleported information between two microchips by using a quantum mechanical entanglement of two photons.
The researchers bypassed the classic method of data transfer where you send an information-bearing photon between two chips. Instead, they teleported information from one silicon chip to another utilizing a quantum-mechanically entangled photon pair.
Photons connected in an entangled quantum state know each other’s characteristics at any time. A change in the state of one immediately results in a similar change in the other.
This peculiar relationship can be used to exchange quantum information between the locations where the entangled photons are sent. In the long run, this approach could one day be used to develop completely secure internet connections.
Even today, quantum physics can be employed to send very secretive messages that no other party can be privy to. The technology is still in its infancy but that hasn't stopped companies from offering equipment for quantum mechanical exchange of encryption keys.
In these cases, however, a direct optical fiber link is needed between the two parties wanting to send secret messages. This means there are physical limitations to how long such a link can be.
For users hundreds of miles apart, the distance issue can be solved through the use of a so-called trusted node. However, this is not without setbacks: It makes the connection slower, more expensive, and, of course, less secure.
A safer more reliable infrastructure for quantum communication between a large number of users is needed. This is where the researchers’ recent demonstration of chip-to-chip quantum teleportation comes in.
The study was conducted by four researchers from the Centre for Silicon Photonics for Optical Communications (SPOC) at DTU’s Department of Photonics Engineering in collaboration with researchers from the University of Bristol in the UK and Peking University in Beijing, China.
“In our chip, we can produce two photons that are in the entangled quantum state. We can then send one photon one way, and the other way. They then function as a single system, regardless of the distance between them. When you measure one photon, you change the common quantum state and thus determine the state of the other. In this way, we were able to use the entangled photons to transfer information from one chip to another,” explains Assistant Professor Davide Bacco, one of the four DTU researchers.

It appears a quantum computer rivalry is growing between the U.S. and China.
Physicists in China claim they've constructed two quantum computers with performance speeds that outrival competitors in the U.S., debuting a superconducting machine, in addition to an even speedier one that uses light photons to obtain unprecedented results, according to a recent study published in the peer-reviewed journals Physical Review Letters and Science Bulletin.
China has exaggerated the capabilities of its technology before, but such soft spins are usually tagged to defense tech, which means this new feat could be the real deal.
China's quantum computers still make a lot of errors
The supercomputer, called Jiuzhang 2, can calculate in a single millisecond a task that the fastest conventional computer in the world would take a mind-numbing 30 trillion years to do. The breakthrough was revealed during an interview with the research team, which was broadcast on China's state-owned CCTV on Tuesday, which could make the news suspect. But with two peer-reviewed papers, it's important to take this seriously. Pan Jianwei, lead researcher of the studies, said that Zuchongzhi 2, which is a 66-qubit programmable superconducting quantum computer is an incredible 10 million times faster than Google's 55-qubit Sycamore, making China's new machine the fastest in the world, and the first to beat Google's in two years.
The Zuchongzhi 2 is an improved version of a previous machine, completed three months ago. The Jiuzhang 2, a different quantum computer that runs on light, has fewer applications but can run at blinding speeds of 100 sextillion times faster than the biggest conventional computers of today. In case you missed it, that's a one with 23 zeroes behind it. But while the features of these new machines hint at a computing revolution, they won't hit the marketplace anytime soon. As things stand, the two machines can only operate in pristine environments, and only for hyper-specific tasks. And even with special care, they still make lots of errors. ""In the next step we hope to achieve quantum error correction with four to five years of hard work,"" said Professor Pan of the University of Science and Technology of China, in Hefei, which is in the southeastern province of Anhui.
China's quantum computers could power the next-gen advances of the coming decades
""Based on the technology of quantum error correction, we can explore the use of some dedicated quantum computers or quantum simulators to solve some of the most important scientific questions with practical value,"" added Pan. The circuits of the Zuchongzhi have to be cooled to very low temperatures to enable optimal performance for a complex task called random walk, which is a model that corresponds to the tactical movements of pieces on a chessboard.
The applications for this task include calculating gene mutations, predicting stock prices, air flows in hypersonic flight, and the formation of novel materials. Considering the rapidly increasing relevance of these processes as the fourth industrial revolution picks up speed, it's no exaggeration to say that quantum computers will be central in key societal functions, from defense research to scientific advances to the next generation of economics.

Quantum radar technology, a remote-sensing method based on quantum entanglement, has so far remained theoretical with experiments only conducted in laboratories. Now, researchers at the University of Waterloo are developing a new approach that could see the technology deployed for the first time outside of a lab.
“This project will allow us to develop the technology to help move quantum radar from the lab to the field,” said Jonathan Baugh, a faculty member at the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) and a professor in the Department of Chemistry. The project is being led by Baugh with three other researchers at IQC and the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology (WIN).
According to the University of Waterloo, if successful, the new technology would “help radar operators cut through heavy background noise and isolate objects — including stealth aircraft and missiles — with unparalleled accuracy.” This may explain why the project has received $2.7 million in funding from Canada's Department of National Defence’s (DND) All Domain Situational Awareness (ADSA) Science & Technology program.
A program with its eyes on the Arctic
According to a statement released by the Government of Canada last October, ASDA “is a new program led by DND, which aims to leverage science & technology expertise from other government departments, academia, industry and allies, to identify, assess and validate technologies in support of air and maritime surveillance, particularly in the North.” The program has received up to $133million in funding for use over the next five years and has been set up to have a particular focus on the Arctic, now that climate change is making the region more accessible.
“In the Arctic, space weather such as geomagnetic storms and solar flares interfere with radar operation and make the effective identification of objects more challenging. By moving from traditional radar to quantum radar, we hope to not only cut through this noise but also to identify objects that have been specifically designed to avoid detection,” said Baugh.
Stealth aircraft are designed to be undetectable by traditional radar through a combination of shape, paint and electronic artificial noise jamming. Researchers believe that quantum radars would be able to detect these specialized planes without even alerting them.

Introducing quantum illumination
“It could change the way we think about national security,” said Baugh. But in order for the project to take off, Baugh and his team first need to succeed in producing pairs of entangled photons on demand, no easy feat.
“The goal for our project is to create a robust source of entangled photons that can be generated at the press of a button,” said Baugh. This is because quantum radar technology is based on a technique called quantum illumination where one photon from a pair is shot out at a distant object while the other stays behind.
Quantum illumination is still very much in its infancy. Time will tell what advancements Baugh's team will bring to the field.

The study draws on previous research by Soviet physicists Leonid Mandelstam and Igor Tamm.
Quantum computers, unlike their conventional counterparts, use quantum mechanics to process information, which enables them to solve a wider range of problems - but still, there are limits.
Conventional computers use binary code composed of sequences of 1s and 0s known as ""bits"" to store information, whereas quantum computers use quantum bits. Also known as ""qubits,"" these units of information ""resemble a wave rather than a series of discrete values,"" according to the Technion.
Information is linked together in conventional computers by building blocks known as ""gates,"" and when gates are combined, simple calculations may be performed. In quantum computers, information processing occurs in a similar manner where ""gates change the wave function.""
Dr. Andrea Alberti of the Institute of Applied Physics at the University of Bonn and one of the study's authors explained that ""They require a minimum amount of time to transform the wave function and the information this contains."" Mandelstam and Tamm theoretically deduced this required minimum time in their research, and this new study investigates the limit they determined.
To investigate that limit, this study's authors initially observed the motion of cesium atoms as they rolled ""like marbles"" down a light bowl, though this method proved to have variables that hindered the researchers' ability to identify information changes. ""We therefore devised a different method to detect the deviation from the initial state,"" Alberti explained.
Another strategy was then attempted. Gal Ness, a doctoral student at the Technion and the lead author of the study explained that the team ""used fast light pulses to create a so-called quantum superposition of two states of the atom. Figuratively speaking, the atom behaves as if it had two different colors at the same time."" Each copy of the atom ""takes a different position in the light bowl: One is high up on the edge and 'rolls' down from there. The other, conversely, is already at the bottom of the bowl. This twin does not move - after all, it cannot roll up the walls and so does not change its wave function.""
The atom clones were then compared at regular intervals using a technique called ""quantum interference"" to determine exactly when a significant change of the matter wave occurred.
The height above the bottom of the light bowl was varied at the start of the experiment to control the atom's ""position energy."" Technion Prof. Yoav Sagi explained: ""We were able to demonstrate that the minimum time for the matter wave to change depends on this energy uncertainty. The greater the uncertainty, the shorter the Mandelstam-Tamm time.""
While these results aligned with the predictions of the two Russian researchers, another effect that was discovered did not. When the physicists increased the energy uncertainty ""until it exceeded the average energy of the atom, then the minimum time did not decrease further - contrary to what the Mandelstam-Tamm limit would actually suggest."" The new findings proved that there is a speed limit imposed by the atom's average energy.
The study was funded by the Reinhard Frank Foundation in collaboration with the German Technion Society, the German Research Foundation (DFG), the Helen Diller Quantum Center at the Technion, and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).",3654,"['hpy04kz', 'hpxfmds', 'hpxnjf1', 'hpyp2rb', 'hpxk2nl', 'hpzual4', 'hpzukmg', 'hpypc56']"

Since 2002, Hyperstealth has been in the business of designing camouflage patterns for military uniforms, vehicles, and installations. In 2010, at the International Camouflage Symposium, Hyperstealth’s CEO Guy Cramer demonstrated SmartCamo — a material that could reportedly adjust its camouflage markings to match its surroundings. We say “reportedly” because Cramer apparently published a video demonstration of SmartCamo, but then US military intervened and asked him to take it down. Presumably Quantum Stealth is a follow-up from SmartCamo.
Again, for security reasons, Cramer is saying very little about Quantum Stealth. All of the pictures that you see here, and on Hyperstealth’s site, are mock-ups, because “for security issues we can not show the actual technology.” Cramer says that both the US and Canadian military have seen Quantum Stealth in action, and that they’ve also confirmed that the material obscures the target from infrared (thermal) imaging. Below, you can see Cramer talking to CNN’s Pentagon correspondent about Quantum Stealth.
Now, we’ve written about invisibility cloaks in the past, but these have generally been very small, lab-based experiments that only work with very specific wavelengths of light. These invisibility cloaks generally work by bending light around an object using metamaterial waveguides — think of them as optical paths that negatively refract light, so that their detour around the object can’t be discerned. So far, we have only managed to develop metamaterials that bend specific wavelengths of light — so the object might be invisible to microwaves or infrared, but not both. Quantum Stealth reportedly works across the entire range of visible light, and infrared too. If this is really the case, Quantum Stealth completely redefines the state of the art.
In theory, Quantum Stealth works by bending light around the target, and Cramer certainly uses the right words to support his case — nanotechnology, metamaterials — but it’s still very hard to believe that a lone inventor in Canada has actually succeeded in creating an invisibility cloak. It’s not impossible, but it’s improbable. I want to say that there’s a clue in the name — that Quantum Stealth somehow uses some neat glitch in quantum mechanics to provide invisibility — but really, it’s probably just hyperbole, like the company’s name. If Quantum Stealth really exists, though, you’d assume that the US military would be quick to flaunt its new toy. After all, there’s nothing more terrifying than an invisible army.",2843,"['c7gjjeq', 'c7gq825', 'c7ghhpf', 'c7gjtx5', 'c7gk0qz', 'c7gjeg5', 'c7gsmiw', 'c7gllkl', 'c7giy33', 'c7gkfuq', 'c7gkbj9', 'c7gkkvc', 'c7gls5s', 'c7gnmem', 'c7gua5h', 'c7gjf7n', 'c7gkpji', 'c7gonv4', 'c7gqgqr', 'c7grq1z', 'c7gsrs1', 'c7gway5', 'c7gk126', 'c7gn8so', 'c7gjjeq', 'c7gq825', 'c7ghhpf', 'c7gjtx5', 'c7gk0qz', 'c7gjeg5', 'c7gsmiw', 'c7gllkl', 'c7giy33', 'c7gkfuq', 'c7gkbj9', 'c7gkkvc', 'c7gls5s', 'c7gnmem', 'c7gua5h', 'c7gjf7n', 'c7gkpji', 'c7gonv4', 'c7gqgqr', 'c7grq1z', 'c7gsrs1', 'c7gway5', 'c7gk126', 'c7gn8so']"

Take a piece of material that blocks light and cut two small slits in it; hit the slits with a flood of photons, and they'll interfere with each other as they exit the far side, creating a pattern of peaks and valleys corresponding to where the wavelengths of the photons interfered constructively and destructively. Do the same thing, but send the photons at the slits one at a time, and you still see the same pattern. In effect, the photon flows through both slits as a probability wave, and these probabilities interfere with each other.
Stranger still, the same behavior can be observed with particles. In many circumstances, an electron will behave as a simple, easy-to-quantify particle. But it will also act as a probability wave when confronted with a double slit.
It's a great example, but it also raises a question that's obvious only after you've heard it asked: what happens if there's more than two slits? Is there a limit to how many probabilities a single particle can adopt as it flows through the quantum realm? A paper that will be released by Science today provides a pretty clear answer: two, just as quantum mechanics have suspected. That deceptively simple answer, however, has major implications for our attempts to combine quantum mechanics and gravity into a unified theory of everything.
And, in fact, the new paper explains this rather nicely in the first few sentences of the abstract:
Quantum mechanics and gravitation are two pillars of modern physics. Despite their success in describing the physical world around us, they seem to be incompatible theories. There are suggestions that one of these theories must be generalized to achieve unification.
Apparently, one of the options for generalizing quantum mechanics would be to allow violations of Born's Rule, an axiom that dictates that quantum interference can only occur between pairs of probabilities. Higher order interference could potentially allow a reformulation of quantum mechanics that is compatible with, or even incorporates, gravitation. The authors helpfully point out that actually testing Born's Rule could be rather helpful for theoreticians, given that, if it proves to be an actual rule, then the theoreticians would have one less option to worry about when it comes to describing the Universe.
So, the authors built a triple-slit system, set up so that they could open and close each of the slits. One of the three ended up not opening fully, which actually created a small source of error in the experiments. The fact that the photodetectors at the far end didn't have perfect performance added another source. In the end, however, the authors calculated that the total errors in the system allowed it to be accurate down to one percent, a fairly rigorous test of Born's Rule.
To get their photons, they used two different light sources: a laser with the power turned down so that it only emitted one photon at a time, and a source of quantum light called heralded single photons. With everything in place, they started firing photons off one at a time, until 30 million of them had hit the detector.
By closing off different slits before starting a measurement, they were able to measure the interference probabilities of each of the potential combinations, and then compare them to the pattern seen when all three slits were open. As Born's Rule predicts, the three-slit interference pattern was a complex mixture of the pairwise interference of different slits, but no higher-order interference was present that involved all three slits.
Quantum mechanics remains secure, at least to the one percent error of the experimental setup. With better hardware or alternate experimental setups, the authors suggest, we could narrow that down even further.
That may be bad news for the theoreticians, but it's good news for quantum mechanics, given that the authors ominously suggest that, should Born's Rule be violated, ""then Schrödinger’s equation would likely have to be modified as well.""",4115,"['c0uz2os', 'c0uyb8k', 'c0uz48a', 'c0uz2pl', 'c0uz6oa', 'c0uyfjs', 'c0uyper', 'c0uy1vm', 'c0uzwhc', 'c0uy1np', 'c0uz5ho', 'c0uz2os', 'c0uyb8k', 'c0uz48a', 'c0uz2pl', 'c0uz6oa', 'c0uyfjs', 'c0uyper', 'c0uy1vm', 'c0uzwhc', 'c0uy1np', 'c0uz5ho']"

In partnership with NASA, Google has embarked on a project to use a 512-qubit D-Wave Two(Opens in a new tab) quantum computer to tackle some of our biggest computational problems.
[seealso slug=""nasa-obscure-sites""]
And because visuals often help explain complex concepts, Google has posted a short documentary explaining what quantum computing is, and how it plans to use the technology to make new discoveries.
First announced back in May, Google’s partnership with NASA will allow the two teams -- along with several universities -- to share the powerful computer, so they can research several different areas.
Traditional digital computing – which drives the computer you’re using now -- operates using a binary approach, which on a basic level refers to differentiating bits of data in their 1 and 0 states from one another.
Quantum computing differs from digital computing in that it gives researchers the power to put bits of data into their 0 and 1 states simultaneously, rather than cycling through calculations in a linear fashion as is common with traditional digital computers. The potential applications for quantum computing could advance our understanding of weather patterns, theoretical physics and even artificial intelligence.
This new computing dynamic not only gives scientists the ability to determine a variety of possible solutions simultaneously, but it also saves energy and speeds up the computing process by many orders of magnitude.
For Google in particular, quantum computing could help it make advances in search, neural networking and artificial intelligence. These advances will ultimately help the company achieve its goal of being able to tell you what you want before you even ask it.
Of course, this very general description of quantum computing is still bit too much for some of us -- still making our way through the tangle of traditional computing -- to fully grasp. That’s why Google’s new video is a welcome primer on the topic, offering a set of very simple and entertaining explanations on the technology.
While the NASA partnership presents exciting possibilities for harnessing the new technology, Google has been looking at quantum computing for some time. As early as 2009, Google discussed its research work with quantum-computing company D-Wave, which was related to studying machine-learning with quantum algorithms.
At the time, Google’s Hartmut Neven wrote(Opens in a new tab), “Over the past three years, a team at Google has studied how problems such as recognizing an object in an image or learning to make an optimal decision based on example data can be made amenable to solution by quantum algorithms … These algorithms promise to find higher-quality solutions for optimization problems than obtainable with classical solvers.”
The field of quantum computing is still so new that even researchers aren’t exactly sure of what they’ll learn over the next few years; it's what makes the project even more exciting.
Posting a message to Google+(Opens in a new tab), the Google Quantum A.I. Lab team wrote, “We’re still in the early, early days, but we think quantum computing can help solve some of the world’s most challenging computer-science problems.
""We’re particularly interested in how quantum computing can advance machine learning, which can then be applied to virtually any field: from finding the cure for a disease to understanding changes in our climate.”

This new state, called a quantum spin liquid (QSL), could lead to significant advances in data storage. QSLs also exhibit a quantum phenomenon called long-range entanglement, which could lead to new types of communications systems, and more.
Generally, when we talk about magnetism’s role in the realm of technology, there are just two types: Ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Ferromagnetism has been known about for centuries, and is the underlying force behind your compass’s spinning needle or the permanent bar magnets you played with at school. In ferromagnets, the spin (i.e. charge) of every electron is aligned in the same direction, causing two distinct poles. In antiferromagnets, neighboring electrons point in the opposite direction, causing the object to have zero net magnetism (pictured below). In combination with ferromagnets, antiferromagnets are used to create spin valves: the magnetic sensors used in hard drive heads.
In the case of quantum spin liquids, the material is a solid crystal — but the internal magnetic state is constantly in flux. The magnetic orientations of the electrons (their magnetic moment) fluctuate as they interact with other nearby electrons. “But there is a strong interaction between them, and due to quantum effects, they don’t lock in place,” says Young Lee, senior author of the research. It is these strong interactions that apparently allow for long-range quantum entanglement.
The existence of QSLs has been theorized since 1987, but until now no one has succeeded in actually finding one. In MIT’s case, the researchers spent 10 months growing a tiny sliver of herbertsmithite (pictured above) — a material that was suspected to be a QSL, but which had never been properly investigated. (Bonus points if you can guess who herbertsmithite is named after.) Using neutron scattering — firing a beam of neutrons at a material to analyze its structure — the researchers found that the herbertsmithite was indeed a QSL.
Moving forward, Lee says that the discovery of QSLs could lead to advances in data storage (new forms of magnetic storage) and communications (long-range entanglement). Lee also seems to think that QSLs could lead us towards higher-temperature superconductors — i.e. materials that superconduct under relatively normal conditions, rather than -200C.
Really, though, the most exciting thing about quantum spin liquids is that they’re completely new, and thus we ultimately have no idea how they might eventually affect our world. “We have to get a more comprehensive understanding of the big picture,” Lee says. “There is no theory that describes everything that we’re seeing.”

A blockchain is a digital tool that uses cryptography techniques to protect information from unauthorized changes. It lies at the root of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency2. Blockchain-related products are used everywhere from finance and manufacturing to health care, in a market worth more than US$150 billion.
When information is money, data security, transparency and accountability are crucial. A blockchain is a secure digital record, or ledger. It is maintained collectively by users around the globe, rather than by one central administration. Decisions such as whether to add an entry (or block) to the ledger are based on consensus — so personal trust doesn’t come into it. Any party inside or outside the network can check the integrity of the ledger by making a simple calculation.
But within a decade, quantum computers will be able to break a blockchain’s cryptographic codes. Here we highlight how quantum technology makes blockchains vulnerable — and how it could render them more secure.
One-way codes
Blockchain security relies on ‘one-way’ mathematical functions. These are straightforward to run on a conventional computer and difficult to calculate in reverse. For example, multiplying two large prime numbers is easy, but finding the prime factors of a given product is hard — it can take a conventional computer many years to solve.
Such functions are used to generate digital signatures that blockchain users cite to authenticate themselves to others. These are easy to check and extremely difficult to forge. One-way functions are also used to validate the history of transactions in the blockchain ledger. The hash, a short sequence of bits, is derived from a combination of the existing ledger and the block that is to be added; this alters whenever the contents of the entry are changed. Again, it is relatively easy to find the hash of a block (to process information to add a record) but difficult to pick a block that would yield a specific hash value. That would require reversing the process to derive the information that generated the hash.
Bitcoin also requires that the hash meets a mathematical condition. Anyone who wishes to add a block to the ledger must keep their computer running a random search until that condition is reached. This process slows the addition of blocks, giving time for everything to be recorded and checked by everyone in the network. It also stops any individual from monopolizing network administration, because anyone with sufficient computational power can contribute blocks.
Yet, within ten years, quantum computers will be able to calculate the one-way functions, including blockchains, that are used to secure the Internet and financial transactions. Widely deployed one-way encryption will instantly become obsolete.
Information security has faced such mass extinctions before. For example, during the Second World War, German military messages were encoded and decrypted using Enigma machines, initially giving the Axis powers an advantage until the Allies cracked the Enigma code. And in 1997, the Data Encryption Standard, an algorithm for encrypting electronic data that was then state of the art, was broken in a public contest to prove its lack of security. That gave rise to a second competition to develop a new protocol, resulting in today’s Advanced Encryption Standard.
Quantum advantage
Quantum computers exploit physical effects, such as superpositions of states and entanglement, to perform computational tasks. They are currently much less powerful than conventional computers, but will soon be able to outperform them on certain tasks. One such example is breaking security protocols that are based on cryptographic algorithms, as mathematician Peter Shor pointed out in 19943. A blockchain is particularly at risk from this because one-way functions are its sole line of defence — a user’s only protection is their digital signature, whereas bank clients are protected by plastic cards, security questions, identity checks and human cashiers.
Cracking of digital signatures is therefore the most imminent threat. A wrongdoer equipped with a quantum computer could use Shor’s algorithm to forge any digital signature, impersonate that user and appropriate their digital assets. Most specialists think that this feat would require a universal quantum computer (one capable of performing a wide variety of calculations), which is more than a decade away. Yet some researchers suggest that this could happen sooner, using emerging quantum computational devices that have more limited capabilities, such as those being developed by the computing firms D-Wave, Google and others4,5.
Quantum computers will find solutions quickly, potentially enabling the few users who have them to censor transactions and to monopolize the addition of blocks to the Bitcoin ledger (known as mining). These parties could sabotage transactions, prevent their own from being recorded or double-spend. An international team of researchers has highlighted the possible impacts of such attacks6, with a report earlier this year charting the threats and suggesting a possible workaround7.
If nothing is done to update the protocols, cryptocurrencies will crash once quantum computers become available.
Improving security
Fortunately, quantum technologies also offer opportunities to enhance the security and performance of blockchains.
Quantum-safe encryption. Quantum communications are inherently authenticated — no user can impersonate another. Such technologies use states of individual particles of light (photons) to encode bits and communicate them. Fundamental physics stipulates that quantum states cannot be copied or measured without being altered. Any eavesdropper will be immediately uncovered.
Quantum cryptography can be used to replace classical digital signatures and to encrypt all peer-to-peer communications in the blockchain network. Our group has demonstrated such a simple system8. However, the complexity and cost of quantum cryptography networks will limit their adoption. In particular, current protocols require that each node in the network be connected to every other through optical fibre channels, because there is no trust in any intermediary node and hence all communications must be direct. Protocols will be needed to maintain secure communications even when information flows through untrustworthy nodes; these systems have been developed but need to be made more accessible for consumers.
Photon losses in optical fibres are another challenge. These limit the range of modern quantum-key distribution systems to a few tens of kilometres. The solution is to develop a quantum repeater, which uses quantum teleportation and quantum optical memory to distribute entangled states between the communicating parties. Research is progressing, but is a long way from delivering a practical device.
In the interim, one-way functions should be tightened. Some alternative encryption functions have been proposed9 that should be equally difficult to reverse using conventional or quantum computers. Although not completely secure, these could be run on existing hardware and would buy time, but they, too, could be deciphered in the long term.
Quantum internet. Using quantum technology for communicating as well as for the computational processing of blockchain data would further enhance security and enable blockchains to become faster and more efficient. This step requires a ‘quantum internet’10 — connecting quantum computers across a quantum communications network. It would then become possible to run fully quantum blockchains. These would bypass some computationally intensive steps of the current verification and consensus processes, and thus be more efficient and more secure. The proposed Quantum Bitcoin currency could be realized, with its security assured by the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics. Such quantum ‘bank notes’, if they still prove necessary in future, could be made impossible to forge by containing quantum information records11.
The quantum internet is several decades away, so ‘blind quantum computation’ is an interim step. In this, a user with a conventional computer could run an algorithm on a remote quantum computer without sharing the input data or algorithm. This technology would enable public cloud-quantum-computing platforms, making blockchains cheaper and more accessible.
Next steps
The blockchain business needs to update its existing software to use one-way cryptographic functions that are equally hard to reverse using conventional or quantum computers9. Until these post-quantum solutions are established or standardized, platforms must be flexible and capable of changing cryptographic algorithms on the fly12.
The longer-term answer is to develop and scale up the quantum communication network and, subsequently, the quantum internet. This will take major investments from governments. However, countries will benefit from the greater security offered13. For example, Canada keeps its census data secret for 92 years, a term that only quantum cryptography can assure. Government agencies could use quantum-secured blockchain platforms to protect citizens’ personal financial and health data. Countries leading major research efforts in quantum technologies, such as China, the United States and members of the European Union, will be among the early adopters. They should invest immediately in research. Blockchains should be a case study for Europe’s Quantum Key Distribution Testbed programme, for example.
Much greater urgency needs to be given to these risks — their impact could be grave.",9724,"['ea183nv', 'ea1hiin', 'ea18qx4', 'ea152it', 'eamrs0w']"

Engineers in Sydney have demonstrated a quantum integrated circuit made up of just a few atoms. By precisely controlling the quantum states of the atoms, the new processor can simulate the structure and properties of molecules in a way that could unlock new materials and catalysts.
The new quantum circuit comes from researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and a start-up company called Silicon Quantum Computing (SQC). It’s essentially made up of 10 carbon-based quantum dots embedded in silicon, with six metallic gates that control the flow of electrons through the circuit.
It sounds simple enough, but the key lies in the arrangement of these carbon atoms down to the sub-nanometer scale. Relative to each other, they’re precisely positioned to mimic the atomic structure of a particular molecule, allowing scientists to simulate and study the structure and energy states of that molecule more accurately than ever before.
In this case, they arranged the carbon atoms into the shape of the organic compound polyacetylene, which is made up of a repeating chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms with an alternating pattern of single and double carbon bonds between them. To simulate those bonds, the team placed the carbon atoms at different distances apart.
Next, the researchers ran an electrical current through the circuit to check whether it would match the signature of a natural polyacetylene molecule – and sure enough, it did. In other tests, the team created two different versions of the chain by cutting bonds at different places, and the resulting currents matched theoretical predictions perfectly.
The significance of this new quantum circuit, the team says, is that it could be used to study more complicated molecules, which could eventually yield new materials, pharmaceuticals, or catalysts. This 10-atom version is right on the limit of what classical computers can simulate, so the team’s plans for a 20-atom quantum circuit would allow for simulation of more complex molecules for the first time.
“Most of the other quantum computing architectures out there haven't got the ability to engineer atoms with sub-nanometer precision or allow the atoms to sit that close,” said Professor Michelle Simmons, lead researcher on the study. “And so that means that now we can start to understand more and more complicated molecules based on putting the atoms in place as if they're mimicking the real physical system.”

A research team, including renowned Chinese quantum physicist Pan Jianwei, announced Friday a significant computing breakthrough, achieving a quantum computational advantage.
Pan is a professor of physics at the University of Science and Technology of China, focusing on quantum information and quantum foundations. As one of the pioneers in experimental quantum information science, he has accomplished a series of profound achievements, which has brought him worldwide fame. Due to his numerous progresses on quantum communication and multi-photon entanglement manipulation, quantum information science has become one of the most rapidly developing fields of physical science in China in recent years.
The team established a quantum computer prototype, named ""Jiuzhang,"" via which up to 76 photons were detected. The study was published in Science magazine online.
With this achievement, China has reached the first milestone on the path to full-scale quantum computing – a quantum computational advantage, also known as ""quantum supremacy,"" which indicates an overwhelming quantum computational speedup.
No traditional computer can perform the same task in a reasonable amount of time, and the speedup is unlikely to be overturned by classical algorithmic or hardware improvements, according to the team.
In the study, Gaussian boson sampling (GBS), a classical simulation algorithm, was used to provide a highly efficient way of demonstrating quantum computational speedup in solving some well-defined tasks.
The average detected photon number by the prototype is 43, while up to 76 output photon-clicks were observed.
Jiuzhang's quantum computing system can implement large-scale GBS 100 trillion times faster than the world's fastest existing supercomputer.
The team also said the new prototype processes 10 billion times faster than the 53-qubit quantum computer developed by Google.
""Quantum computational advantage is like a threshold,"" said Lu Chaoyang, professor of the University of Science and Technology of China. ""It means that, when a new quantum computer prototype's capacity surpasses that of the strongest traditional computer in handling a particular task, it proves that it will possibly make breakthroughs in multiple other areas.""
The breakthrough is the result of 20 years of effort by Pan's team, which conquered several major technological stumbling blocks, including a high-quality photon source.
""For example, it is easy for us to have one sip of water each time, but it is difficult to drink just a water molecule each time,"" Pan said. ""A high-quality photon source needs to 'release' just one photon each time, and each photon needs to be exactly the same, which is quite a challenge.""
Compared with conventional computers, Jiuzhang is currently just a ""champion in one single area,"" but its super-computing capacity has application potential in areas such as graph theory, machine learning and quantum chemistry, according to the team.

The system marks a major step toward building large-scale quantum machines that could be used to shed light on a host of complex quantum processes and eventually help bring about real-world breakthroughs in material science, communication technologies, finance, and many other fields, overcoming research hurdles that are beyond the capabilities of even the fastest supercomputers today. Qubits are the fundamental building blocks on which quantum computers run and the source of their massive processing power.
“This moves the field into a new domain where no one has ever been to thus far,” said Mikhail Lukin, the George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Physics, co-director of the Harvard Quantum Initiative, and one of the senior authors of the study published today in the journal Nature. “We are entering a completely new part of the quantum world.”
According to Sepehr Ebadi, a physics student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the study’s lead author, it is the combination of system’s unprecedented size and programmability that puts it at the cutting edge of the race for a quantum computer, which harnesses the mysterious properties of matter at extremely small scales to greatly advance processing power. Under the right circumstances, the increase in qubits means the system can store and process exponentially more information than the classical bits on which standard computers run.
“The number of quantum states that are possible with only 256 qubits exceeds the number of atoms in the solar system,” Ebadi said, explaining the system’s vast size.
Already, the simulator has allowed researchers to observe several exotic quantum states of matter that had never before been realized experimentally, and to perform a quantum phase transition study so precise that it serves as the textbook example of how magnetism works at the quantum level.
These experiments provide powerful insights on the quantum physics underlying material properties and can help show scientists how to design new materials with exotic properties.
The project uses a significantly upgraded version of a platform the researchers developed in 2017, which was capable of reaching a size of 51 qubits. That older system allowed the researchers to capture ultra-cold rubidium atoms and arrange them in a specific order using a one-dimensional array of individually focused laser beams called optical tweezers.
This new system allows the atoms to be assembled in two-dimensional arrays of optical tweezers. This increases the achievable system size from 51 to 256 qubits. Using the tweezers, researchers can arrange the atoms in defect-free patterns and create programmable shapes like square, honeycomb, or triangular lattices to engineer different interactions between the qubits.
“The workhorse of this new platform is a device called the spatial light modulator, which is used to shape an optical wavefront to produce hundreds of individually focused optical tweezer beams,” said Ebadi. “These devices are essentially the same as what is used inside a computer projector to display images on a screen, but we have adapted them to be a critical component of our quantum simulator.”
The initial loading of the atoms into the optical tweezers is random, and the researchers must move the atoms around to arrange them into their target geometries. The researchers use a second set of moving optical tweezers to drag the atoms to their desired locations, eliminating the initial randomness. Lasers give the researchers complete control over the positioning of the atomic qubits and their coherent quantum manipulation.",3850,"['h4pxy3m', 'h4qmlf6']"

The company is testing a 20-qubit processor – its most powerful quantum chip yet – and is on target to have a working 49-qubit chip by the end of this year.
Qubits, or quantum bits, can be a mixture of 0 and 1 at the same time, making them potentially more powerful than classical bits.
And if everything goes to plan, the 49-qubit chip will make Google the first to build a quantum computer capable of solving certain problems that are beyond the abilities of ordinary computers. Google set itself this ambitious goal, known as quantum supremacy, in a paper published last July.

Alan Ho, an engineer in Google’s quantum AI lab, revealed the company’s progress at a quantum computing conference in Munich, Germany. His team is currently working with a 20-qubit system that has a “two-qubit fidelity” of 99.5 per cent – a measure of how error-prone the processor is, with a higher rating equating to fewer errors.
For quantum supremacy, Google will need to build a 49-qubit system with a two-qubit fidelity of at least 99.7 per cent. Ho is confident his team will deliver this system by the end of this year. Until now, the company’s best public effort was a 9-qubit computer built in 2015.
Moving fast
“Things really have moved much quicker than I would have expected,” says Simon Devitt at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. Now that Google and other companies involved in quantum computing have mastered much of the fundamental science behind creating high-quality superconducting qubits, the big challenge facing these firms is scaling these systems and reducing their error rates.
It is important not to get carried away with numbers of qubits, says Michele Reilly, CEO at Turing Inc, a quantum start-up. It’s impossible to really harness the power of these machines in a useful way without error correction, she says – a technique that mitigates the fickle nature of quantum mechanics.
Ho says it will be 2027 before we have error-corrected quantum computers, so useful devices are still some way off. But if Google can be the first to demonstrate quantum supremacy, showing that qubits really can beat regular computers, it will be a major scientific breakthrough.

Now the search giant has revealed it is investigating the use of quantum computers to run its next generation of faster applications.
Writing on Google’s research blog this week, Hartmut Neven, head of its image recognition team, reveals that the Californian firm has for three years been quietly developing a quantum computer that can identify particular objects in a database of stills or video.
Google has been doing this, Neven says, with D-Wave, a Canadian firm that has developed an on-chip array of quantum bits – or qubits – encoded in magnetically coupled superconducting loops.

The team set themselves the challenge of writing an algorithm for the chip that could learn to recognise cars in photos, and reported at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Vancouver, Canada, this week that they have succeeded.
Chasing cars
Using 20,000 photographs of street scenes, half of which contained cars and half of which didn’t, they trained the algorithm to recognise what cars look like by hand-labelling all the cars with boxes drawn around them.
After that training, the algorithm was set loose on a second set of 20,000 photos, again with half containing cars. It sorted the images with cars from those without faster than an algorithm on a conventional computer could – faster than anything running in a Google data centre today, Neven says.
Classical computers use what is known as a von Neumann architecture, in which data is fetched from memory and processed according to rules defined in a program to generate results that are stored. It is pretty much a sequential process, though multiple versions of it can run in parallel to speed things up a little.
Quantum computers, however, promise much faster processing, by exploiting the principle of quantum superposition: that a particle such as an ion, electron or photon can be in two different states at the same time. While each basic “bit” of data in a conventional computer can be either a 1 or a 0 at any one time, a qubit can be both at once.
Quantum argument
D-Wave’s Chimera chip launched to great media interest. But there has been some dispute over whether it is actually a quantum computer, which Neven acknowledges.
“It is not easy to demonstrate that a multi-qubit system such as the D-Wave chip exhibits the desired quantum behaviour, and physicists are still in the process of characterising it,” he writes.
Google’s quantum move is understandable, says Winfried Hensinger, reader in quantum, atomic and optical physics at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK.
“Quantum computing has the potential to make search problems much easier to solve – so it is no surprise that Google finds it extremely important to get involved in this emerging area,” he says.
“I expect more and more companies to pursue research in quantum computing due to its vast potential not only in search but also for a multiplicity of other problems,” he adds.
However, he expects that while questions remain over the exact capabilities of D-Wave’s hardware, future developments will centre on different hardware. “It is widely accepted that trapped ions are the most successful implementation of quantum technology.”

IBM has come up with a way to simulate quantum computers that have 56 quantum bits, or qubits, on a non-quantum supercomputer – a task previously thought to be impossible. The feat moves the goalposts in the fight for quantum supremacy, the effort to outstrip classical computers using quantum ones.
It used to be widely accepted that a classical computer cannot simulate more than 49 qubits because of memory limitations. The memory required for simulations increases exponentially with each additional qubit.
The closest anyone had come to putting the 49-qubit limit to a test was a 45-qubit simulation at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, which needed 500 terabytes of memory. IBM’s new simulation upends the assumption by simulating 56 qubits with only 4.5 terabytes.

The simulation is based on a mathematical trick that allows a more compact numerical representation of different arrangements of qubits, known as quantum states.
A quantum computing operation is typically represented by a table of numbers indicating what should be done to each qubit to produce a new quantum state. Instead, researchers at IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, used tensors – effectively multidimensional tables augmented with axes beyond rows and columns.
Thanks to the additional axes, much more information can be squashed into a few tensors, so long as we know how to write it down in the language of tensors. The researchers found a way to do just that for quantum computing operations.
Embarrassingly parallel
While writing down the operations in tensor form, they also found out a way to divide the simulation task into what they call “embarrassingly parallel” chunks, which allowed them to use the many processors of a supercomputer simultaneously. This won them the final bit of efficiency needed to simulate a 56-qubit quantum computer.
“IBM pushed the envelope,” says Itay Hen at the University of Southern California. “It’s going to be much harder for quantum-device people to exhibit [quantum] supremacy.”
IBM now has a functional 56-qubit quantum computer living in their supercomputer. But while that’s an improvement on the previous record, Andrew Childs at the University of Maryland says it’s not a huge leap forward. “I don’t think they’re claiming that this is going to give them an efficient simulation of quantum systems on a classical computer,” he says.
Even so, they’ve upped the ante in the race to outperform classical computers with quantum systems. Google previously said they were on track to build a working 49-qubit processor by the end of 2017, but that will no longer win them the achievement of quantum supremacy.
Bob Wisnieff, the principal investigator of the IBM study, says their current simulation runs about “a billion times slower” than the theoretical estimates for an actual 56-qubit quantum computer.
Wisnieff’s team plans to experiment with supercomputers whose processors can communicate efficiently with one another. They expect to be able to squeeze out a few more qubits from these communication channels, which help speed up the parallel computation needed for the simulation.
IBM’s goal is to build a quantum computer that can “explore practical problems” such as quantum chemistry, says Wisnieff. He hopes to check the accuracy of quantum computers against his simulations before putting real quantum computers to the test.
“I want to be able to write algorithms that I know the answers for before I run them on a real quantum computer,” he says.

Jeremy has been at the company since 2000.
Right now, we [Dwave Systems] have a 1000 qubit processor in our lab. Dwave has a plan to release it later in 2014. The major thing that’s changing aside from some of the design details is the scale of the problem you can represent, going from a 500-variable graph to a 1000-variable graph. Complexity of that is growing tremendously. [It leads to an] unimaginable exponential blowup of the number of solutions. That scale of problems is getting that much harder for classical algorithms to solve.
[After that] we’re planning to release a 2000-bit processor design. That’s pushing into a scale of territory where we’re tackling problems that are very difficult for people to solve [with conventional methods]. The community is working on getting a few qubits to work at the scale they’re trying to work at.
Dwave saw that between that 128 qubit and 512 qubit, there was a 300,000x improvement in performance. That kind of performance gain is really unprecedented.
There are algorithms related to the factoring problem that can be run on Dwave hardware and they have done some basic work along those lines. It’s simply not a particularly interesting market segment for a business. Dwave has focused on problems that can connect to things like machine learning, financial modeling, logistics and scheduling. They clearly relate to major business challenges.
Google and Lockheed have purchased DWave systems. Dwave has received about $130 million in investment from Draper Fisher Jurvetson (major venture capital company) and some from the CIA’s investment arm.

Here’s a quantum of solace. The first quantum transmission to go via space paves the way for ultra-secure communications satellites.
Secret encryption keys transmitted via quantum links provide the ultimate way to communicate securely. That’s because any attempt to intercept the key will be revealed thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics, which say that interception will introduce changes that give away eavesdroppers.
The technology is already available for fibre-optic cables, but a truly global network would need satellites to beam quantum data between distant locations. To test how these might work, Paolo Villoresi at the University of Padua in Italy and his colleagues turned to satellites covered in ultra-reflective mirrors. These are normally used to bounce laser beams back to Earth. The time they take to return shows up any shifts in gravity.

Record bounce
In 2007, the team sent a beam of light to space using the Matera Laser Ranging Observatory (MLRO) in Italy and detected single photons bounced off Japan’s Ajisai satellite. For the latest experiment, they prepared photons in four different quantum states – the minimum required to generate an encryption key – and sent them to space using the MLRO. They were able to receive quantum bits of information, or qubits, bounced back from five satellites up to 2600 kilometres above. That smashes the previous record for sending quantum information – 144 kilometres, between two locations on Earth.
To ensure they didn’t count background photons that were not part of the signal, the team timed the laser pulses exactly, rejecting any light that returned outside a narrow time window. The observatory acted as the transmitter and receiver, so the team decided not to send an encrypted message. Still, the team thinks the photons would have been able to encrypt about one bit of data a second.
The team has a way to go before quantum satellites are up to speed. Light travells easily through fibre optic cables compared to turbulent air, so ground-based commercial versions of the technology can encrypt at much faster rates of at least 1 megabit a second.
Villoresi compares the performance to Sputnik, the first-ever satellite, launched in 1957. “Comments at the time were, ‘How nice, the satellite can send a few beeps, it’s totally useless’,” he says. “We are more or less the same level.” But even a very limited data channel could be used to send secure commands to a spacecraft, he says.
Closer to quantum comms
Rupert Ursin at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in Vienna, Austria, points out that Villoresi’s team sent the qubits in four bursts, each tens of seconds apart. That means they did not detect all four quantum states at once, which would be necessary for a true quantum satellite.
And Jian-Wei Pan at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei notes that a lot of photons are lost in transmission, so he is not sure the signal would be strong enough to transmit a full quantum key. But Pan and Ursin both say the work shows the technology is getting close.
China has announced plans to launch a true quantum communications satellite in 2016, and other nations’ space agencies are investigating the possibility. “Everything is ready, and if we had enough money we could fly,” says Ursin. “The risk that we fail in space is reduced thanks to these kinds of experiments.”

In October, Chinese scientists unveiled the world's fastest programmable quantum computer, a million times more powerful than Google's most advanced supercomputer. Their technology can accomplish in one millisecond what would take a typical computer some 30 trillion years.
America is finally taking notice. Last Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed two documents—an executive order and a National Security Memorandum—to boost America's quantum capabilities on offense and defense. That means developing our own quantum computing technology, and protecting our key IT infrastructure from quantum attacks by adversaries. If we're not prepared for the eventuality of a quantum cyberattack that could render useless every password and computing device, from the iPhones in our pockets to GPS in aircraft to the supercomputers that process stock market transactions, the national security consequences will be enormous.
Quantum computing, a form of high-speed calculation at the subatomic level conducted at extraordinarily cold temperatures, will bring computers to speeds barely imaginable today. Atoms, photons and electrons that operate beyond the classical laws of physics and in the realm of ""quantum"" can be harnessed for extraordinary computing power. Complex problems that once took years to solve could take seconds.
And that means everything we know about cybersecurity—every lock secured by current encryption methods—could get blown wide open.
Think of encryption like a math problem. Using modern 256-bit encryption, you have 78 digits' worth of possible combinations to sort through to get the right code and break the digital lock: 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936 possible combinations, to be exact. Today's hardware and software, using bits, would take millions of years to sort through that many combinations. Quantum bits—or qubits—can be used in parallel to exponentially accelerate a computer's ability to solve algorithms once thought impossible.
It's possible that China's recent quantum advancement claims are exaggerated, but the advent of quantum computing is not a question of ""if,"" but ""when."" Ransomware attacks routinely make global headlines. Russia is using cyberattacks as weapons of war against Ukraine. But a U.S. adversary unleashing quantum computing into our digital environment would unleash nothing less than a cybersecurity apocalypse, where corporate, government and military secrets are put at risk by technology that could break 256-bit encryption in a matter of hours.
President Biden's recent moves will better coordinate our government's efforts to prevent this nightmare scenario, by bringing federal agencies and critical infrastructure companies together to address quantum threats. It also brings the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee under White House control.
Centralizing the government response is important, but a comprehensive approach will have to look beyond Washington as well. We must engage and incentivize America's higher education system to train more quantum engineers. Beyond our own borders, it will be important to work with like-minded nations like Britain, India, Japan and South Korea to share breakthroughs in quantum technology.
America must also harness the full might and ingenuity of its private sector to remain competitive and avoid a repeat of the cyberattacks that have held some of the country's biggest sectors hostage. Cybersecurity experts and chief information officers can start by encrypting data at rest, tokenizing data and micro-segmenting user and system access controls that allow for fewer ""backdoor"" entry points. And then there's the old-fashioned method of putting more locks on the door—or in this case, encrypting data several times using different algorithms, making the code-breaking process longer and tougher for even quantum computers.
Quantum technology will revolutionize our future as much as the internet and atomic weapons did. It holds enormous promise for pharmaceutical development and discovery, climate modeling and artificial intelligence. But we are also careening toward a perilous future—the worst-case cybersecurity scenarios can and will play out if America remains ill-prepared. Our vulnerabilities in securing infrastructure, personal, business and classified data are very real, especially so in an era of great-power competition with adversaries like Russia and China, which boast advanced and aggressive cyber capabilities.
From Pearl Harbor to Sputnik to 9/11, the United States has found itself surprised and outmatched before, and yet it found ways to marshal the unwieldy gears of government, the will of the public and the ingenuity of the private sector to meet those challenges—even if belatedly. The coming dawn of the quantum age is no different. We must capitalize on the momentum kicked off by Biden's executive actions. Our choice is a simple one: to await the devastation of the first cyberattack fueled by quantum decryption, or to build the defenses to stop it.

For the first time, anyone with a web browser will soon be able to log in and run basic algorithms on a quantum chip hooked up to the internet.
A quantum chip processes information in qubits, or quantum bits, which, unlike the digital bits in a regular computer, can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. In theory, this ability should allow quantum computers to offer far speedier computation than current PCs – although devices that can definitely outperform standard machines don’t yet exist.
Until now only a few labs around the world have had access to even basic quantum computers. Google recently purchased a D-Wave quantum computer and shares access with NASA and other select researchers, but not with the general public. Questions also remain over just how quantum D-Wave’s machine really is, because it operates using a non-mainstream technique called adiabatic quantum computing.

Scientists at the University of Bristol, UK, were concerned that limited availability to any type of quantum computer would mean a dearth of skilled coders when the expected quantum revolution finally arrives.
“A quantum computer can do things faster for you, but someone has to program it, and at the moment there are only a handful of people around the world who would be qualified,” says Bristol’s Jeremy O’Brien, who led the development of the quantum chip being used in the cloud project.
Quantum sim
The more traditionally quantum chip made at the University of Bristol works by guiding two photons through a series of optical channels. As the photons pass through the chip they become entangled, meaning that a measurement on one influences the outcome when measuring the other. Programming the computer involves tweaking the extent of this entanglement to produce different computations.
Would-be quantum coders will first use an online simulator that lets them practise programming. A tutorial explains the key quantum-mechanical ideas that are central to the device, then guides users through the steps required to adjust the chip and change its output. Once experienced enough, users can ask for permission to connect to the real chip, which is sitting in a lab in Bristol. It will run programs and return results via the internet.
“You can sit on the bus with your mobile phone and do a quantum optics experiment which might never have been seen before,” says team member Peter Shadbolt. The simulator is already online, but the ability to directly access the chip won’t launch until 20 September.
Cloudy future
Exactly what a member of the public might want to use the quantum chip for is unclear. And the version being used online only has two qubits, so its processing power is a very limited.
“It’s not going to calculate something that your PC couldn’t calculate, because it’s not at that scale by a long way,” says O’Brien. His team has made 6-qubit and 8-qubit computers, but those projects are still in development. In the meantime, they are happy to let others use their older technology for free as a way to encourage engagement.
The beginnings of a quantum cloud should be a fun way to demonstrate the technology for the public, says Scott Aaronson at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is not part of the project. And while a 2-qubit device won’t be more useful than your regular PC, putting it online might foreshadow how we will access large-scale quantum computers in future, he says.
“If quantum computing does become a practical technology, there will be a relatively small number of quantum computers, which people will access remotely.”

But the test program revealed significant hurdles that must be overcome before the device is ready for real work.
Earlier in the year, a team at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, built a quantum computer capable of processing two quantum bits, or qubits. Qubits store more information than the simple “on” or “off” bits of conventional computing, which means that a quantum computer outperform conventional computers in tasks such as cryptanalysis.
As in a classical computer, a series of logic gates processes the information – although here the gates are quantum logic, or qubit, gates. “For example, a simple single-qubit gate would change a ‘one’ to a ‘zero’ and vice versa,” says David Hanneke, a member of the team. But unlike the physical logic gates of a classical computer, the quantum logic gates used in the team’s device are each encoded into a laser pulse.
Logic trick
The experimental device uses beryllium ions to store qubits in the way they spin while the laser-pulse quantum gates perform simple logic operations on the qubits. The trick to making a quantum logic gate is in designing a series of laser pulses that manipulate the beryllium ions in a way that processes information. Another laser then reads off the results of the calculations.

“Once we had demonstrated we could successfully combine lots of components in this way, we ask: what can you do with that?” says Hanneke.
They found their answer in quantum computational theory. “One of the more interesting results to come out of the early years of quantum information was that you can do any quantum operation on any number of qubits using only single and two-qubit logic gates,” says Hanneke. Although one and two-qubit gates have already been built and used to perform specific algorithms, no one had yet built a device capable of all possible quantum routines. Until now.
Infinite possibilities
At the heart of the device is a gold-patterned aluminium wafer containing a tiny electromagnetic trap some 200 micrometres across, into which the team placed four ions – two of magnesium and two of beryllium. The magnesium ions act as “refrigerants”, removing unwanted vibrations from the ion chain and so keeping the device stable.
There are an infinite number of possible two-qubit operations, so the team chose a random selection of 160 to demonstrate the universality of the processor. Each operation involves hitting the two qubits with 31 distinct quantum gates encoded into the laser pulses. The majority were single-qubit gates, and so the pulse needed to interact with just one ion, but a small number were two-qubit gates requiring the pulse to “talk” to both ions.
By controlling the voltage on the gold electrodes surrounding the trap, the team can uncouple the ions when single-qubit gates are needed and couple them again for two-qubit operations.
Not perfect
The team ran each of the 160 programs 900 times. By comparing the results with theoretical predictions, they were able to show that the processor had worked as planned.
But it did so with an accuracy of only 79 per cent, says Hanekke. “Each gate is more than 90 per cent accurate, but when you stack them together the total figure falls to 79 per cent or so for a given operation,” he says.
That’s because each of the laser pulses that act as the gates varies slightly in intensity. “They’re not ‘square’ pulses [that switch on and off cleanly] – they fluctuate,” he says. And the beam has to be split, reflected and manipulated in various ways beforehand, which also introduces errors.
Such errors would drown the results of any more extensive computations. The fidelity needs to increase to around 99.99 per cent before it could be a useful component of a quantum computer. That could be done by improving the stability of the laser and reducing the errors from optical hardware, says the team.
If those levels of accuracy can be reached, the new chip could form an integral part of a useful quantum processor. “If you have a simple and repetitive task you might have a dedicated region [of the processor] to do that,” he says. “But you need regions that can do all kinds of stuff – this is just such a device.”

A team of Chinese researchers has, for the first time, transmitted quantum entangled particles of light through water – the first step in using lasers to send underwater messages that are impossible to intercept.
“People have talked about the idea of underwater quantum communication before, but I’m not aware of anyone who has done an experiment like this,” says Thomas Jennewein at the University of Waterloo in Canada. “An obvious application would be a submarine which wants to remain submerged but communicate in a secure fashion.”
Entanglement starts with a beam of light shot into a crystal. This prism splits the light into pairs of photons with strangely linked behaviour. Manipulate one particle in a pair, and its partner will instantly react. Measure the first one’s polarisation, for example, and entanglement could ensure that its twin will have the opposite polarisation when measured.

These entangled photons can theoretically be used to set up a secure communication line between two people, with privacy guaranteed by the laws of physics.
But this fragile quantum state can easily be disturbed by the surrounding environment. So far, entanglement has been maintained between particles separated by long distances after traveling through air, space and optical fibres.
To test entanglement in water, which is less forgiving toward light, Xianmin Jin and his colleagues at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China gathered saltwater from the Yellow Sea and placed it in a 3-metre-long container. They were able to transmit entangled photons through the water without disturbing their quantum link.
As the first experiment of its kind, it’s not clear whether this will be enough to build a communications system. Three meters may not seem that impressive compared with the 1200 kilometres that a Chinese satellite recently sent entangled particles down to Earth’s surface. “It’s not very surprising to me that if I send light through 10 feet of water it doesn’t get depolarised,” says Paul Kwiat at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
But Jin says this is only the beginning. His team’s calculations suggest that it should be possible to communicate over nearly 900 metres in water. Previous calculations set a more conservative limit of just over 120 metres.
“Because ocean water absorbs light, extending this is going to difficult,” says Jeffrey Uhlmann at the University of Missouri in Columbia. “One option would be to use relays, but right now this is very far removed from anything that would be practical.”

In this case, the word “holographic” indicates a way to simplify physics problems involving both quantum mechanics and gravity, not a literal hologram, so simulations like this could help us understand how to combine those two concepts into a theory of quantum gravity – perhaps the toughest and most important problem in physics right now.
Both quantum mechanics, which governs the very small, and general relativity, which describes gravity and the very large, are extraordinarily successful in their respective realms, but these two fundamental theories do not fit together. This incompatibility is particularly apparent in areas where both theories should apply, such as in and around black holes.
These areas are extraordinarily complicated, and that is where holography comes in. It allows physicists to create a less complex system that is equivalent to the original, similar to how a two-dimensional hologram can show three-dimensional details.

Maria Spiropulu at the California Institute of Technology and her colleagues used Google’s Sycamore quantum computer to simulate a holographic wormhole – a tunnel through space-time with black holes at either end. They simulated a type of wormhole through which a message could theoretically pass, and examined the process by which such a message could make that journey.
In a real wormhole, that journey would be largely mediated by gravity, but the holographic wormhole uses quantum effects as a substitute for gravity to remove relativity from the equation and simplify the system. That means that when the message passes through the wormhole, it is actually undergoing quantum teleportation – a process by which information about quantum states can be sent between two distant but quantum entangled particles. For this simulation, the “message” was a signal containing a quantum state – a qubit in a superposition of both 1 and 0.
“The signal scrambles, it becomes mush, it becomes chaos, and then it gets put back together and appears immaculate on the other side,” says Spiropulu. “Even on this tiny system we could prop up the wormhole and observe just what we expected.” This occurs because of the quantum entanglement between the two black holes, which allows the information falling into one end of the wormhole to be preserved at the other end. That process is part of why a quantum computer is useful for this type of experiment.
The simulation used only nine quantum bits, or qubits, so it was very low-resolution. Like a picture of a bird taken from far away, this had the same general shape as the object it represented, but the simulation had to be carefully adjusted to display the characteristics of a wormhole. “If you want to see this as a wormhole, there are a number of parallels, but it’s definitely a matter of interpretation,” says Adam Brown at Stanford University in California, who was not involved in this work.
Using a more powerful quantum computer could help bring the image into focus. “This is just a baby wormhole, a first step to test the theories of quantum gravity, and as the quantum computers scale up we have to start using bigger quantum systems to try to test the bigger ideas in quantum gravity,” says Spiropulu.
That is crucial because some theories of quantum gravity are difficult or even impossible to completely understand using only classical computing. “We know that quantum gravity is very confusing, the theory can be very hard to extract predictions from, and the dream would be to do something on a quantum computer that tells you things you don’t already know about quantum gravity,” says Brown. “This is not that – this is a very small quantum computer, so everything about it is completely possible to simulate on a laptop without the fan even starting.”
But the simulation’s similarity to a real wormhole hints that it may be possible to use quantum computers to formulate and test ideas about quantum gravity, and maybe eventually to understand it.

The navigation system it will be testing should record the vessel’s position with 1000 times more accuracy than anything before.
If successful, the system, known as quantum positioning, could be miniaturised for use in aircraft, trains, cars and even cellphones. This would provide a backup navigation tool in cities’ concrete canyons, or in autonomous vehicles, where a loss of GPS signal can be dangerous.
GPS doesn’t work underwater, so submarines navigate using accelerometers to register every twist and turn of a vessel after it submerges and loses its last positioning fix. But this isn’t very accurate.

“Today, if a submarine goes a day without a GPS fix we’ll have a navigation drift of the order of a kilometre when it surfaces,” says Neil Stansfield at the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down. “A quantum accelerometer will reduce that to just 1 metre.”
To create the supersensitive quantum accelerometers, Stansfield’s team was inspired by the Nobel-prizewinning discovery that lasers can trap and cool a cloud of atoms placed in a vacuum to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. Once chilled, the atoms achieve a quantum state that is easily perturbed by an outside force – and another laser beam can then be used to track them. This looks out for any changes caused by a perturbation, which are then used to calculate the size of the outside force.
The DSTL team wants this set-up to be usable in the real-world setting of a submarine, where the size of the force would correspond to the movements as the sub swings around in the sea.
Their prototype quantum accelerometer, which resembles a 1-metre-long shoe box, will be trialled on land in September 2015, the team will say at a conference at the UK National Physical Laboratory in Teddington this week. It will initially operate along just one axis, before two more sets of lasers and trapped atoms are added to accommodate motion in all three dimensions. Each will cool 1 million atoms of rubidium. “Once we have understood the first generations, we’ll start to miniaturise it for other applications,” says Stansfield.
It’s not a done deal yet, though, because the accelerometer can’t distinguish between tiny gravitational effects and accelerations caused by a vessel’s movement. “If the submarine passes an underwater mountain whose gravity attracts it to the west, that feels exactly like an acceleration to the east,” says Edward Hinds at the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial College London, who is developing the accelerometer for the DSTL. “This means that very good gravity maps will be required to navigate correctly.”
The DSTL isn’t alone in pursuing quantum navigation: teams in the US, China and Australia are chasing the same prize.
“Super-accurate navigation makes sleeping easier for the captain of a submarine,” says John Powis, head of the NATO Submarine Rescue Service in Faslane, UK, and a former navigator on Royal Navy submarines. It will also make it easier to go on patrol undetected, as submarines will no longer have to expose a mast to GPS, he says.
“Super-accurate navigation would make sleeping easier for the captain of a submarine”
But Powis thinks this technology may have the greatest impact in future generations of weapons – once it has shrunk down in size. “The submarine does not need to know its position in metres and centimetres,” he says. “But a projectile like a missile or shell might.”
The DSTL team believes the technology has applications beyond warfare, though.”Ten to 20 years ago this would have needed a huge cryogenic cooler, but laser-cooled atom clouds are changing all that,” says team leader Stephen Till. He says future generations of the technology are likely to make their way into everything from cars to our smartphones. “We’re convinced the size and power will come down for broad use.”

Mikhail Lukin at Harvard University announced the achievement on 14 July at the International Conference on Quantum Technologies in Moscow.
Quantum simulators are used to model the minute behaviour of molecules, and could help study how drugs act within the human body. They aren’t full-blown quantum computers, though, says Simon Devitt at Macquarie University in Sydney.
Lukin’s system was specifically built to solve one equation that models the interactions between certain atoms. If you wanted to solve a different equation, you’d have to rebuild the system from scratch.

Quantum computers, on the other hand, are theoretically capable of handling any equation you throw at them. But they are a much bigger challenge to build, says Devitt.
The simulator has a high error rate, but because it simulates just one mathematical model, it can still produce useful results some of the time. Full-blown quantum computers must achieve much lower error rates, but will produce better results.
Today’s most advanced quantum systems – such as the 49-qubit computer Google is working on – exploit superconductivity to store information, using electrons at extremely low temperatures.
Lukin’s work takes a different approach. His qubits are each made from a single rubidium atom, trapped in place using lasers and programmed via fluctuations in the laser beam.
Although less complex than quantum computers, simulators are still extremely expensive to build, says Devitt, so it’s unlikely that they will find many practical applications beyond physics departments for the time being.
And while this experiment show that it is possible to create large-scale quantum systems, we’ve still got a long way to go before we create universal quantum computers. “The full-blown quantum computer is the hardest system to get right,” Devitt says.

Stealth aircraft in the Canadian arctic will be no match for a new quantum radar system.
Researchers at the University of Waterloo are developing a new technology that promises to help radar operators cut through heavy background noise and isolate objects—including stealth aircraft and missiles—with unparalleled accuracy.
""In the Arctic, space weather such as geomagnetic storms and solar flares interfere with radar operation and make the effective identification of objects more challenging,"" said Jonathan Baugh, a faculty member at the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) and a professor in the Department of Chemistry who is leading the project with three other researchers at IQC and the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology (WIN). ""By moving from traditional radar to quantum radar, we hope to not only cut through this noise, but also to identify objects that have been specifically designed to avoid detection.""
Stealth aircraft rely on special paint and body design to absorb and deflect radio waves—making them invisible to traditional radar. They also use electronic jamming to swamp detectors with artificial noise. With quantum radar, in theory, these planes will not only be exposed, but also unaware they have been detected.
Technology to improve national defence
Quantum radar uses a sensing technique called quantum illumination to detect and receive information about an object. At its core, it leverages the quantum principle of entanglement, where two photons form a connected, or entangled, pair.
The method works by sending one of the photons to a distant object, while retaining the other member of the pair. Photons in the return signal are checked for telltale signatures of entanglement, allowing photons from the noisy environmental background to be discarded. This can greatly improve the radar signal-to-noise in certain situations.
But in order for quantum radar to work in the field, researchers first need to realize a fast, on-demand source of entangled photons.
""The goal for our project is to create a robust source of entangled photons that can be generated at the press of a button,"" said Baugh.
To date, quantum illumination has only been explored in the laboratory. The Government of Canada, under the Department of National Defence's All Domain Situational Awareness (ADSA) Science & Technology program, is investing $2.7 million to expedite its use in the field.
The 54 North Warning System (NWS) radar stations, based in the Arctic and operated by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), are nearing the end of their life spans and could need to be replaced as early as 2025.

For the first time, physicists have observed novel quantum effects in a topological insulator at room temperature. This breakthrough, published as the cover article of the October issue of Nature Materials, came when Princeton scientists explored a topological material based on the element bismuth.
The scientists have used topological insulators to demonstrate quantum effects for more than a decade, but this experiment is the first time these effects have been observed at room temperature. Typically, inducing and observing quantum states in topological insulators requires temperatures around absolute zero, which is equal to -459 degrees Fahrenheit (or -273 degrees Celsius).
This finding opens up a new range of possibilities for the development of efficient quantum technologies, such as spin-based electronics, which may potentially replace many current electronic systems for higher energy efficiency.
In recent years, the study of topological states of matter has attracted considerable attention among physicists and engineers and is presently the focus of much international interest and research. This area of study combines quantum physics with topology—a branch of theoretical mathematics that explores geometric properties that can be deformed but not intrinsically changed.
""The novel topological properties of matter have emerged as one of the most sought-after treasures in modern physics, both from a fundamental physics point of view and for finding potential applications in next-generation quantum engineering and nanotechnologies,"" said M. Zahid Hasan, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Princeton University, who led the research.
""This work was enabled by multiple innovative experimental advances in our lab at Princeton,"" added Hasan.
The main device component used to investigate the mysteries of quantum topology is called a topological insulator. This is a unique device that act as an insulator in its interior, which means that the electrons inside are not free to move around and therefore do not conduct electricity.
However, the electrons on the device's edges are free to move around, meaning they are conductive. Moreover, because of the special properties of topology, the electrons flowing along the edges are not hampered by any defects or deformations. This device has the potential not only of improving technology but also of generating a greater understanding of matter itself by probing quantum electronic properties.
Until now, however, there has been a major stumbling block in the quest to use the materials and devices for applications in functional devices. ""There is a lot of interest in topological materials and people often talk about their great potential for practical applications,"" said Hasan, ""but until some macroscopic quantum topological effect can be manifested at room temperature, these applications will likely remain unrealized.""
This is because ambient or high temperatures create what physicists call ""thermal noise,"" which is defined as a rise in temperature such that the atoms begin to vibrate violently. This action can disrupt delicate quantum systems, thereby collapsing the quantum state. In topological insulators, in particular, these higher temperatures create a situation in which the electrons on the surface of the insulator invade the interior, or ""bulk,"" of the insulator, and cause the electrons there to also begin conducting, which dilutes or breaks the special quantum effect.
The way around this is to subject such experiments to exceptionally cold temperatures, typically at or near absolute zero. At these incredibly low temperatures, atomic and subatomic particles cease vibrating and are consequently easier to manipulate. However, creating and maintaining an ultra-cold environment is impractical for many applications; it is costly, bulky and consumes a considerable amount of energy.
But Hasan and his team have developed an innovative way to bypass this problem. Building on their experience with topological materials and working with many collaborators, they fabricated a new kind of topological insulator made from bismuth bromide (chemical formula α-Bi4Br4), which is an inorganic crystalline compound sometimes used for water treatment and chemical analyses.
""This is just terrific that we found them without giant pressure or an ultra-high magnetic field, thus making the materials more accessible for developing next-generation quantum technology,"" said Nana Shumiya, who earned her Ph.D. at Princeton, is a postdoctoral research associate in electrical and computer engineering, and is one of the three co-first authors of the paper.
She added, ""I believe our discovery will significantly advance the quantum frontier.""
The discovery's roots lie in the workings of the quantum Hall effect—a form of topological effect that was the subject of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1985. Since that time, topological phases have been intensely studied. Many new classes of quantum materials with topological electronic structures have been found, including topological insulators, topological superconductors, topological magnets and Weyl semimetals.
While experimental discoveries were rapidly being made, theoretical discoveries were also progressing. Important theoretical concepts on two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators were put forward in 1988 by F. Duncan Haldane, the Sherman Fairchild University Professor of Physics at Princeton.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2016 for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and a type of 2D topological insulators. Subsequent theoretical developments showed that topological insulators can take the form of two copies of Haldane's model based on electron's spin-orbit interaction.
Hasan and his team have been on a decade-long search for a topological quantum state that may also operate at room temperature, following their discovery of the first examples of three-dimensional topological insulators in 2007. Recently, they found a materials solution to Haldane's conjecture in a kagome lattice magnet that is capable of operating at room temperature, which also exhibits the desired quantization.
""The kagome lattice topological insulators can be designed to possess relativistic band crossings and strong electron-electron interactions. Both are essential for novel magnetism,"" said Hasan. ""Therefore, we realized that kagome magnets are a promising system in which to search for topological magnet phases, as they are like the topological insulators that we discovered and studied more than ten years ago.""
""A suitable atomic chemistry and structure design coupled to first-principles theory is the crucial step to make topological insulator's speculative prediction realistic in a high-temperature setting,"" said Hasan. ""There are hundreds of topological materials, and we need both intuition, experience, materials-specific calculations, and intense experimental efforts to eventually find the right material for in-depth exploration. And that took us on a decade-long journey of investigating many bismuth-based materials.""
Insulators, like semiconductors, have what are called insulating, or band, gaps. These are in essence ""barriers"" between orbiting electrons, a sort of ""no-man's-land"" where electrons cannot go. These band gaps are extremely important because, among other things, they provide the lynchpin in overcoming the limitation of achieving a quantum state imposed by thermal noise.
They do this if the width of the band gap exceeds the width of the thermal noise. But too large a band gap can potentially disrupt the spin-orbit coupling of the electrons—this is the interaction between the electron's spin and its orbital motion around the nucleus. When this disruption occurs, the topological quantum state collapses. Therefore, the trick in inducing and maintaining a quantum effect is to find a balance between a large band gap and the spin-orbit coupling effects.
Following a proposal by collaborators and co-authors Fan Zhang and Yugui Yao to explore a type of Weyl metals, Hasan and team studied the bismuth bromide family of materials. But the team was not able to observe the Weyl phenomena in these materials. Hasan and his team instead discovered that the bismuth bromide insulator has properties that make it more ideal compared to a bismuth-antimony based topological insulator (Bi-Sb alloys) that they had studied before.
It has a large insulating gap of over 200 meV (""milli electron volts""). This is large enough to overcome thermal noise, but small enough so that it does not disrupt the spin-orbit coupling effect and band inversion topology.
""In this case, in our experiments, we found a balance between spin-orbit coupling effects and large band gap width,"" said Hasan. ""We found there is a 'sweet spot' where you can have relatively large spin-orbit coupling to create a topological twist as well as raise the band gap without destroying it. It's kind of like a balance point for the bismuth-based materials that we have been studying for a long time.""
The researchers knew they had achieved their goal when they viewed what was going on in the experiment through a sub-atomic resolution scanning tunneling microscope, a unique device that uses a property known as ""quantum tunneling,"" where electrons are funneled between the sharp metallic, single-atom tip of the microscope and the sample.
The microscope uses this tunneling current rather than light to view the world of electrons on the atomic scale. The researchers observed a clear quantum spin Hall edge state, which is one of the important properties that uniquely exist in topological systems. This required additional novel instrumentation to uniquely isolate the topological effect.
""For the first time, we demonstrated that there's a class of bismuth-based topological materials that the topology survives up to room temperature,"" said Hasan. ""We are very confidant of our result.""
This finding is the culmination of many years of hard-won experimental work and required additional novel instrumentation ideas to be introduced in the experiments. Hasan has been a leading researcher in the field of experimental quantum topological materials with novel experimentation methodologies for over 15 years; and, indeed, was one of the field's early pioneer researchers.
Between 2005 and 2007, for example, he and his team of researchers discovered topological order in a three-dimensional bismuth-antimony bulk solid, a semiconducting alloy and related topological Dirac materials using novel experimental methods. This led to the discovery of topological magnetic materials. Between 2014 and 2015, they discovered a new class of topological materials called magnetic Weyl semimetals.
The researchers believe this breakthrough will open the door to a whole host of future research possibilities and applications in quantum technologies.
""We believe this finding may be the starting point of future development in nanotechnology,"" said Shafayat Hossain, a postdoctoral research associate in Hasan's lab and another co-first author of the study. ""There have been so many proposed possibilities in topological technology that await, and finding appropriate materials coupled with novel instrumentation is one of the keys for this.""
One area of research where Hasan and his team believe this breakthrough will have particular impact is on next-generation quantum technologies. The researchers believe this new breakthrough will hasten the development of more efficient, and ""greener"" quantum materials.
Currently, the theoretical and experimental focus of the group is concentrated in two directions, said Hasan.
First, the researchers want to determine what other topological materials might operate at room temperature, and, importantly, provide other scientists the tools and novel instrumentation methods to identify materials that will operate at room and high temperatures.
Second, the researchers want to continue to probe deeper into the quantum world now that this finding has made it possible to conduct experiments at higher temperatures.
These studies will require the development of another set of new instrumentations and techniques to fully harness the enormous potential of these materials. ""I see a tremendous opportunity for further in-depth exploration of exotic and complex quantum phenomena with our new instrumentation, tracking more finer details in macroscopic quantum states,"" Hasan said. ""Who knows what we will discover?""
""Our research is a real step forward in demonstrating the potential of topological materials for energy-saving applications,"" added Hasan. ""What we've done here with this experiment is plant a seed to encourage other scientists and engineers to dream big.""

A happy accident in the laboratory has led to a breakthrough discovery that not only solved a problem that stood for more than half a century, but has major implications for the development of quantum computers and sensors.In a study published today in Nature, a team of engineers at UNSW Sydney has done what a celebrated scientist first suggested in 1961 was possible, but has eluded everyone since: controlling the nucleus of a single atom using only electric fields.
""This discovery means that we now have a pathway to build quantum computers using single-atom spins without the need for any oscillating magnetic field for their operation,"" says UNSW's Scientia Professor of Quantum Engineering Andrea Morello. ""Moreover, we can use these nuclei as exquisitely precise sensors of electric and magnetic fields, or to answer fundamental questions in quantum science.""
That a nuclear spin can be controlled with electric, instead of magnetic fields, has far-reaching consequences. Generating magnetic fields requires large coils and high currents, while the laws of physics dictate that it is difficult to confine magnetic fields to very small spaces—they tend to have a wide area of influence. Electric fields, on the other hand, can be produced at the tip of a tiny electrode, and they fall off very sharply away from the tip. This will make control of individual atoms placed in nanoelectronic devices much easier.
A new paradigm
Prof Morello says the discovery shakes up the paradigm of nuclear magnetic resonance, a widely used technique in fields as disparate as medicine, chemistry, or mining. ""Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is one of the most widespread techniques in modern physics, chemistry, and even medicine or mining,"" he says. ""Doctors use it to see inside a patient's body in great detail while mining companies use it to analyse rock samples. This all works extremely well, but for certain applications, the need to use magnetic fields to control and detect the nuclei can be a disadvantage.""
Prof Morello uses the analogy of a billiard table to explain the difference between controlling nuclear spins with magnetic and electric fields.
""Performing magnetic resonance is like trying to move a particular ball on a billiard table by lifting and shaking the whole table,"" he says. ""We'll move the intended ball, but we'll also move all the others.""
""The breakthrough of electric resonance is like being handed an actual billiards stick to hit the ball exactly where you want it.""
Amazingly, Prof Morello was completely unaware that his team had cracked a longstanding problem in finding a way to control nuclear spins with electric fields, first suggested in 1961 by a pioneer of magnetic resonance and Nobel Laureate, Nicolaas Bloembergen.
""I have worked on spin resonance for 20 years of my life, but honestly, I had never heard of this idea of nuclear electric resonance,"" Prof Morello says. ""We 'rediscovered' this effect by complete accident—it would never have occurred to me to look for it. The whole field of nuclear electric resonance has been almost dormant for more than half a century, after the first attempts to demonstrate it proved too challenging.""
Out of curiosity
The researchers had originally set out to perform nuclear magnetic resonance on a single atom of antimony—an element that possesses a large nuclear spin. One of the lead authors of the work, Dr. Serwan Asaad, explains: ""Our original goal was to explore the boundary between the quantum world and the classical world, set by the chaotic behaviour of the nuclear spin. This was purely a curiosity-driven project, with no application in mind.""
""However, once we started the experiment, we realised that something was wrong. The nucleus behaved very strangely, refusing to respond at certain frequencies, but showing a strong response at others,"" recalls Dr. Vincent Mourik, also a lead author on the paper.
""This puzzled us for a while, until we had a 'eureka moment' and realised that we were doing electric resonance instead of magnetic resonance.""
Dr. Asaad continued: ""What happened is that we fabricated a device containing an antimony atom and a special antenna, optimized to create a high-frequency magnetic field to control the nucleus of the atom. Our experiment demands this magnetic field to be quite strong, so we applied a lot of power to the antenna, and we blew it up!""
Game on
""Normally, with smaller nuclei like phosphorus, when you blow up the antenna it's 'game over' and you have to throw away the device,"" says Dr. Mourik.""But with the antimony nucleus, the experiment continued to work. It turns out that after the damage, the antenna was creating a strong electric field instead of a magnetic field. So we 'rediscovered' nuclear electric resonance.""
After demonstrating the ability to control the nucleus with electric fields, the researchers used sophisticated computer modelling to understand how exactly the electric field influences the spin of the nucleus. This effort highlighted that nuclear electric resonance is a truly local, microscopic phenomenon: the electric field distorts the atomic bonds around the nucleus, causing it to reorient itself.
""This landmark result will open up a treasure trove of discoveries and applications,"" says Prof Morello. ""The system we created has enough complexity to study how the classical world we experience every day emerges from the quantum realm. Moreover, we can use its quantum complexity to build sensors of electromagnetic fields with vastly improved sensitivity. And all this, in a simple electronic device made in silicon, controlled with small voltages applied to a metal electrode!""

A new quantum sensor can analyze the full spectrum of radio frequency and real-world signals, unleashing new potentials for soldier communications, spectrum awareness and electronic warfare.
The Rydberg sensor uses laser beams to create highly-excited Rydberg atoms directly above a microwave circuit, to boost and hone in on the portion of the spectrum being measured. The Rydberg atoms are sensitive to the circuit's voltage, enabling the device to be used as a sensitive probe for the wide range of signals in the RF spectrum.
""All previous demonstrations of Rydberg atomic sensors have only been able to sense small and specific regions of the RF spectrum, but our sensor now operates continuously over a wide frequency range for the first time,"" said Dr. Kevin Cox, a researcher at the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, now known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory. ""This is a really important step toward proving that quantum sensors can provide a new, and dominant, set of capabilities for our Soldiers, who are operating in an increasingly complex electro-magnetic battlespace.""
The Rydberg spectrum analyzer has the potential to surpass fundamental limitations of traditional electronics in sensitivity, bandwidth and frequency range. Because of this, the lab's Rydberg spectrum analyzer and other quantum sensors have the potential to unlock a new frontier of Army sensors for spectrum awareness, electronic warfare, sensing and communications—part of the Army's modernization strategy.
""Devices that are based on quantum constituents are one of the Army's top priorities to enable technical surprise in the competitive future battlespace,"" said Army researcher Dr. David Meyer. ""Quantum sensors in general, including the one demonstrated here, offer unparalleled sensitivity and accuracy to detect a wide range of mission-critical signals.""

The researchers plan additional development to improve the signal sensitivity of the Rydberg spectrum analyzer, aiming to outperform existing state-of-the-art technology.
""Significant physics and engineering effort is still necessary before the Rydberg analyzer can integrate into a field-testable device,"" Cox said. ""One of the first steps will be understanding how to retain and improve the device's performance as the sensor size is decreased. The Army has emerged as a leading developer of Rydberg sensors, and we expect more cutting-edge research to result as this futuristic technology concept quickly becomes a reality.""

The first chips came more than 30 years ago, and Microsoft’s Basic expanded the software infrastructure around PCs.
Quantum computers are a new type of computer that can be significantly faster than today’s PCs. They are still decades away from replacing PCs and going mainstream, but more advanced hardware and use models are still emerging.
“A lot of that is unfolding and will have a similar dramatic change in the computing landscape,” Vern Brownell, D-Wave’s CEO, said in an interview.
D-Wave is the only company selling a quantum computer. It sold its first system in 2011 and is now pushing the speed limits with a new quantum computer called the D-Wave 2000Q, which has 2,000 qubits.
The 2000Q is twice the size of its current 1,000-qubit D-Wave 2X, which is considered one of the most advanced computers in the world today. A price tag for the 2000Q wasn’t available.
The 2000Q is thousands of times faster than its predecessor and is leagues ahead in performance compared to today’s PCs. The specialized computer, valued at roughly $15 million, will first ship out to Temporal Defense Systems, which will use the system to tackle cybersecurity threats.
D-Wave’s quantum computers are being already used by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Google, NASA, and Lockheed Martin. D-Wave’s goal is to upgrade all those systems.
The ultimate goal is to develop a universal quantum computer that could run all computing applications, much like PCs, but researchers agree that type of quantum computer still decades away.
But like PCs, users first need to start feeling comfortable with quantum computers, and Brownell hopes D-Wave’s systems will ultimately be available to the masses via the cloud. IBM has already made its 5-qubit quantum computer available through the cloud to anyone who wants to play with it.
“To really flourish we have to make it easy to consume,” Brownell said. The cloud will provide developers with a headache-free way to play with qubits without buying the expensive hardware.
There are many types of quantum computers under development, and D-Wave’s system is based on the paradigm of quantum annealing. The computer delivers possible outcomes to a problem by deploying a magnetic field to perform qubit operations.
IBM is working on a different type of quantum computer based on the gate model, which is considered advanced but more complicated to achieve. Microsoft is trying to make a quantum computer based on a new topology and a particle that is yet to be discovered.
D-Wave and IBM were once squabbling, disputing each others’ approaches to a quantum computer. But they are now showing each other respect and have a common goal of speeding up the release of quantum computers. A long-term computer replacement is needed as today’s PCs reach their limits, and quantum computers could be the answer.
D-Wave doesn’t have a particular religious persuasion on what may be considered the right form of quantum computing, Brownell said. The annealer was a quick way to quantum computing and can be injected into today’s demanding workloads.
“We believe in all approaches. My belief in the future is there will be different types of quantum computers,” Brownell said. The company’s view is similar to using different types of chips like CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs for different workloads, with each of them having their own benefits, Brownell said.
Some applications for D-Wave’s quantum computer include machine learning, financial simulations, and coding optimization. For example, the quantum computers could be used to build classifiers for better speech recognition or labeling of images, Brownell said. Algorithms play a big role in making D-Wave’s quantum computers effective.
“Our belief is that machine learning is the killer app for quantum computing,” Brownell said.
Quantum computers calculate differently than today’s computers, which store data in the states of 1 and 0. Quantum computers use qubits, which can store data in the form or either or both simultaneously and in states beyond that. The qubit’s flexibility allows quantum computers to do more calculations simultaneously.
Quantum computers harness the laws of quantum mechanics to achieve various states, but qubits can also be finicky, which is why they have been a scientific challenge for decades. Qubits are unstable and can quickly go out of control, which could break a computing cycle. Researchers are trying to address issues by putting qubits in controlled environments and exerting more control over qubit behavior.
Adding more qubits and new features, like quantum annealing control, has helped speed up and stabilize the D2000Q. D-Wave will speed up its quantum computers with more qubits every 18 months, a rough timeline that Intel follows to advance its PC and server chips.
D-Wave is also trying to get programmers on board to write applications for its quantum computer. It has released Qbsolv, an open-source tool that can break down code to work with the quantum computer. The tool also has interfaces so applications written using popular machine-learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Caffe work with the quantum computer.",5257,"['dcub2yb', 'dcuc3uq', 'dcudxhs', 'dcubhxm', 'dcumdk6']"

They're out there scoping for an Nvidia 4090 (opens in new tab) or AMD's RX7900 range (opens in new tab). But maybe they're thinking a little too simple, a bit too black and white.
The future of computing is slowly turning quantum. Working with the two-state qubits as opposed to normal bits opens up a whole world of computing power that should probably be as feared as it is respected (opens in new tab). With the potential for a Y2K style shakeup (opens in new tab), quantum computing is coming and it's unlikely any of us will be ready for it. Especially as it continues to get even more powerful than we expected.
So instead of a new hot gamer piece of kit, maybe a quantum computer is a better investment. As spotted by PC Watch (opens in new tab), now you can grab one of the world's first commercially available portable quantum computers. They're a little on the basic side, and they'll cost at least as much as that hardcore gamer build you were planning, but they're undeniably a very cool thing to exist.
The Gemini Mini, Gemini, and Triangulum are all members of this family of portable quantum computers developed in China's tech hub Shenzhen by SpinQ technology. You can find them available to purchase on the Switch Science Co store starting at 1,188,000 yen, or about $US8,700 for the 60W Gemini Mini (opens in new tab).
Before you go out and buy a quantum computer you should know that these are fairly limited in some ways. The Gemini and Gemini Mini are the cheaper options and in their most basic configurations are only 2-qubit machines, though they can be used as 8-qubit simulators, and would likely still be a great start. The Gemini (opens in new tab) has a fair bit more power than the mini and goes for 5.72 million yen, or about $US40,000.
The Triangulum (opens in new tab) is clearly the powerhouse of the family, rocking a 330W power draw and weighing a whopping 40kg. This machine has a whole 3 qubits, hence the name, and can be used for pulse sequence engineering. It can also allow for customisation of its quantum circuit and has a port for programming. This one is a bit closer to $US58,000 at 7.92 million yen.
While very expensive, these little quantum babies are kind of incredible pieces of tech. They're all Nuclear Magnetic Resonance or NMR quantum computers, which literally use atoms to compute things. The way NMR works is by taking a molecule and using the nuclear spin of the atoms inside it as the computing system. Plus they can do it at room temperature. I don't understand it and I think it's incredible.

A team of Australian and New Zealand physicists have extended the storage time for a prototype quantum super-computer optical hard drive by over one hundred times.
Scientists at the Australian National University (ANU) and the University of Otago have achieved a major breakthrough, reported in Nature this week, demonstrating six-hour quantum storage using atoms of the rare earth element europium embedded in a crystal.
It has long been hoped that scientists will eventually come up with a way to store data in a state of quantum entanglement for the benefit of ultra-secure communications.
However, at present, such states can only be maintained for a short time before the entanglement fails. The Australian and New Zealand research team has come up with a way to store data for hours, rather than milliseconds. This new breakthrough heralds the world’s first solid state quantum hard drive.
“Quantum states are very fragile and normally collapse in milliseconds. The fact that we have storage times of hours has the potential to revolutionise how we distribute quantum entanglement in a communication network,” says lead author Ms Manjin Zhong, from the Research School of Physics and Engineering at the ANU.
Utilising this effect, a quantum communication network could be used for perfectly secure encryption for data transmission.
“Our experiment shows that it is now possible to think of extending the range of quantum communication by storing entangled light in separate memories and then transporting them to different parts of the network,” Ms Zhong said.
The team essentially created the ROM by embedding an atom of the rare-earth element of europium into a crystal matrix.
After writing a quantum state onto the nuclear spin of the europium using light, the team subjected the crystal to a combination of a fixed and oscillating magnetic fields to lock the atom’s spin in place and preserve the fragile quantum information.
“This prevented the quantum information leaking away for as long as six hours, which is quite surprising,” says Dr Jevon Longdell from the Dodd Walls Centre for Photonic and Quantum Technologies at the University of Otago.
“Our goal is to extend this storage time out past a day. Once we reach this target we believe it will be possible to physically distribute entangled quantum states between any two points on the globe.”
Current quantum communication networks are limited to distances of about 100km.
“You can distrubute the entangled pairs of quantum states literally in a box sent via the post. Then use these entangled pairs to come up with a shared secret key and then use this secret key to do the communication. By comparing the results with your friend you can come up with a secret that only you two share. The neat thing is that we have discovered you can do this comparison without a secure channel,” he says.
“In the old days posting out secure keys was a routine thing to do. From a security point of view it wasn’t great because it involved trusting the courier. This isn’t something that our “quantum post” would suffer from. If someone tried to look what was in the crystal while it was in transit we would notice because they can’t measure the quantum states without disturbing them.”
Dr Longdell says that in the future scientists hope there will be quantum or super-fast computers that can solve difficult problems which current computers cannot solve.
“Our long term storage of quantum states would be helpful to achieve this,” he says.
The team is also excited about the fundamental tests of quantum mechanics that a quantum optical hard drive will enable.
“We have never before had the possibility to explore quantum entanglement over such long distances,” said Associate Professor Matthew Sellars, leader of the research team.
“We should always be looking to test whether our theories match up with reality. Maybe in this new regime our theory of quantum mechanics breaks.”

When the quantum computer was imagined 30 years ago, it was revered for its potential to quickly and accurately complete practical tasks often considered impossible for mere humans and for conventional computers. But, there was one big catch: Tiny-scale quantum effects fall apart too easily to be practical for reliably powering computers.
Now, a team of scientists in Japan may have overcome this obstacle. Using laser light, they have developed a precise, continuous control technology giving 60 times more success than previous efforts in sustaining the lifetime of ""qubits,"" the unit that quantum computers encode. In particular, the researchers have shown that they can continue to create a quantum behavior known as the entangled state—entangling more than one million different physical systems, a world record that was only limited in their investigation by data storage space.
This feat is important because entangled quantum particles, such as atoms, electrons and photons, are a resource of quantum information processing created by the behaviors that emerge at the tiny quantum scale. Harnessing them ushers in a new era of information technology. From such behaviors as superposition and entanglement, quantum particles can perform enormous calculations simultaneously. The report of their investigation appears this week in the journal APL Photonics.
""There is a problem of the lifetime of qubits for quantum information processing. We have solved the problem, and we can continue to do quantum information processing for any time period we want,"" explained Akira Furusawa, of the Department of Applied Physics, School of Engineering at the University of Tokyo and lead researcher on the study. ""The most difficult aspect of this achievement was continuous phase locking between squeezed light beams, but we have solved the problem.""
Quantum computers are considered a next generation of computing after the integrated circuit, silicon-chip based computers that now dominate information processing technology. Current computers use long strings of zeros and ones—called bits—to process information. By contrast, quantum computers process information by harnessing the remarkable power of quantum mechanics that encodes 0s and 1s in quantum states called qubits. Qubits configure in two unusual ways: ""superposition"" and ""entanglement.""
Brace yourself—quantum behaviors are unusual. Einstein himself characterized entanglement as ""spooky action at a distance.""
Start with the fact that quantum systems can be in several states simultaneously—the up and down of superposition, for example. Particles also exhibit the quantum behavior of entanglement. It is a deeply intimate property between quantum particles that unites them perfectly in a shared existence, even at immense distance. In other words, spooky.
And it is this spooky action—entanglement—that the University of Tokyo team discovered how to manage so it can be applied to run quantum computers.
For the next steps on this promising path toward making quantum computing practical, Furusawa envisions creating 2-D and 3-D lattices of the entangled state. ""This will enable us to make topological quantum computing, which is very robust quantum computing,"" he said.

A quantum sensor could give Soldiers a way to detect communication signals over the entire radio frequency spectrum, from 0 to 100 GHz, said researchers from the Army.
Such wide spectral coverage by a single antenna is impossible with a traditional receiver system, and would require multiple systems of individual antennas, amplifiers and other components.
In 2018, Army scientists were the first in the world to create a quantum receiver that uses highly excited, super-sensitive atoms—known as Rydberg atoms—to detect communications signals, said David Meyer, a scientist at the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command's Army Research Laboratory. The researchers calculated the receiver's channel capacity, or rate of data transmission, based on fundamental principles, and then achieved that performance experimentally in their lab—improving on other groups' results by orders of magnitude, Meyer said.
""These new sensors can be very small and virtually undetectable, giving Soldiers a disruptive advantage,"" Meyer said. ""Rydberg-atom based sensors have only recently been considered for general electric field sensing applications, including as a communications receiver. While Rydberg atoms are known to be broadly sensitive, a quantitative description of the sensitivity over the entire operational range has never been done.""
To assess potential applications, Army scientists conducted an analysis of the Rydberg sensor's sensitivity to oscillating electric fields over an enormous range of frequencies—from 0 to 1012 Hertz. The results show that the Rydberg sensor can reliably detect signals over the entire spectrum and compare favorably with other established electric field sensor technologies, such as electro-optic crystals and dipole antenna-coupled passive electronics.
""Quantum mechanics allows us to know the sensor calibration and ultimate performance to a very high degree, and it's identical for every sensor,"" Meyer said. ""This result is an important step in determining how this system could be used in the field.""
This work supports the Army's modernization priorities in next-generation computer networks and assured position, navigation and timing, as it could potentially influence novel communications concepts or approaches to detection of RF signals for geolocation.
In the future, Army scientists will investigate methods to continue to improve the sensitivity to detect even weaker signals and expand detection protocols for more complicated waveforms.

The hope is that quantum computing can have a major positive impact in a range of fields including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and finance.
For comparison, Google revealed a quantum computer back in 2019 with 53 qubits, and IBM's 2021 quantum computer has 127 qubits(Opens in a new window). Fujitsu is aiming to produce a quantum computer ""after March 2027"" with over 1,000 qubits, which should give you a good idea of how quickly quantum computing development is set to accelerate over the next few years.

Two Chinese teams claim to have reached primacy with quantum computers
Two teams in China are claiming that they have reached primacy with their individual quantum computers. Both have published the details of their work in the journal Physical Review Letters.
In the computer world, quantum primacy is the performance of calculations that are not feasible on conventional computers—others use the term ""quantum advantage.""
Over the past several years, several teams working with quantum computers have claimed to have reached primacy, but thus far have been met with skepticism due to questions about whether the algorithm used was the best choice possible, including the one used by Google. In this new effort, both teams are claiming that their computers leave no room for doubt.
Both of the teams in these new efforts were working at the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the University of Science and Technology of China, and both were led by physicist Jian-Wei Pan, who has become well known for his work with quantum entanglement.
In both efforts, the goal was to build a quantum computer capable of calculating the output probabilities of quantum circuits—a task that is relatively simple for a conventional computer to perform when there are just a few inputs and outputs. It grows increasingly difficult as the numbers rise until it becomes unfeasible.
In the first effort, the researchers used a photonic approach in building their computer. To tackle the problem of estimating output probabilities, the team used Gaussian boson sampling as a way to analyze the output. In this case, output from a 144-mode interferometer. Under this scenario, there could be 1043 possible outcomes. The researchers claim their machine was capable of sampling the output 1023 times as fast as a supercomputer, which, they further claim, shows quantum primacy.
The second effort involved creating a superconductor-based computer that was capable of calculating using 66 qubits—only 56 of them were used, however. Still, the researchers found the machine capable of estimating sample calculations up to 1000 times as fast as the best supercomputers, which, they claim, shows that they achieved primacy.

As they published today in the journal Nature",,2014-04-10,William Herkewitz,Two Big Steps Toward the Quantum Computer,"It's a machine that could calculate solutions to problems so impossibly time-consuming that even the most powerful supercomputers could never handle them. And it would do so in an instant. This is the quantum computer, made possible by the bizarre nature of quantum mechanics. And though the idea is still in its infancy, it's no fantasy.
Two research teams, at Harvard University and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany, have just announced that they have independently forged the building blocks for tomorrow's quantum computers. As they published today in the journal Nature (1, 2), the scientists discovered a way to hook up atoms and particles of light to create a new type of switch and logic-gate‚ quantum versions of the connecting structures that link bits of data in modern computers.
Quantum Computers
When you dive down into the circuits, all modern computers are basically the same: a huge collection of data arranged with simple rules. Each piece of data is called a bit and shows just one fragment of information‚ a 0 or a 1. You can think of a bit as a lightbulb that's either shining or not.
But quantum theory‚ the physics that rules the tiny world of atoms and particles‚ tells us that there are certain circumstances in which a piece of matter can be two things at the same time. It's possible to have an atom that's spinning in two opposite directions at once, or even to have your lightbulb both shining and not shining. Items with this wacky dual state are said to be in ""superposition."" (Physicist Niels Bohr once said, ""Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it."" So don't worry if you're confused‚ Bohr was one of the founders of quantum theory.)
The most important catch (there are plenty) is that this superposition state is fragile and possible only for incredibly tiny bits of matter.
But for computers, this very idea poses an interesting prospect. If you could somehow harness this odd state of matter to put individual bits of information into superposition, then suddenly you've packed more data into the tiniest package possible. Your bits can now show a 0, a 1, or a combo of both. This is called a quantum bit, or a qubit. And if qubits were linked together like normal bits are linked in a computer, then you'd have a machine could calculate at insane speeds.
""At this point, very small-scale quantum computers already exist,"" says Mikhail Lukin, the head of the Harvard research team. ""We're able to link, roughly, up to a dozen qubits together. But a major challenge facing this community is scaling these systems up to include more and more qubits.""
The problem of adding more qubits, Lukin explains, is tied to the fragility of the superposition state. Unless the entire quantum computer is kept at extremely cold temperatures and free of any interfering particles or other noise, the superposition state will entirely collapse for all the qubits, ruining the computer. What makes this even harder is that today's qubits must be close to one another to be connected, and it takes a massive apparatus of machinery, lab equipment, and lasers to support the superposition state of just a single fleck of matter. That dumps an increasing amount of grit into the system, increasing the chance that the entire quantum computer will fail.
""It's just very difficult to address one qubit without interfering with all the rest of them; to take a laser beam and shine it one particular qubit and not another,"" says Gerhard Rempe, the head of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics research team. ""And if, for example, you want to use 10,000 qubits, well, that's 10,000 lasers you have to worry about.""
The Ol' Gate and Switch
The new quantum logic gate and switch unveiled today promise to ameliorate some of these problems. Both use a new method: They harness trapped atoms (in both cases, rubidium) that can transfer information through photons, the particles that make up light. Photons, which can be directed through fiber-optic cable, are the prime candidate for sending information at great distances and keeping qubits apart.
Here is how it works: The scientists trap a heavy rubidium atom between two mirror-like sheets using a laser technique that keeps the atom relatively immobile. The scientists then send a photon straight at this atom sandwich. Normally, the photon would hit the first mirror and bounce right back where it came from. But if the atom is put in a specific energetic state, the photon will go straight through that first mirror, hang out with the atom for a moment, and then exit where it came from. As a going-away present, the photon also has a slight change in polarization. This is pretty much how any switch in a computer works. If something is ""on,"" then one thing happens. If it's ""off,"" then another thing happens.
But here's the tricky part. The scientists can put the rubidium atom in superposition, so that it is simultaneously in that energetic state and not in the energetic state. It's on and off. Because of this, the photon both does and does not enter the mirror, mingle, and gain its polarization change. And the photon, by virtue of having both changed and not changed, carries that superposition information and can bring it to a different atom-based qubit.
A similar process happens with the quantum logic gate. A normal logic gate is just a series of switches set up in a way that together, they perform a logical operation when given multiple inputs. The German team created a quantum version by having multiple photons repeatedly bounce off the mirror-trapped and superpositioned rubidium atom. Then, using another funky attribute of quantum physics called entanglement swapping, the scientists made it so that the photons share the same information. These entangled photons can become the multiple inputs required for any logic gate.
Even with this new advancement, we're still a long way from building large-scale quantum computers, with thousands of qubits linked together. ""We're not going to see quantum computers being built for the average American consumer in ten years, or anything like that,"" says Jeff Thompson, a physicist with the Harvard research team.
Rempe says that while this technology seems promising for solving the qubit-closeness issue, neither team is actually attempting to link multiple qubits. And that endeavor will probably open up a new world of unknowns.
Nonetheless, ""It's exciting to see this [photon-based] technology is coming into its own,"" says Jacob Taylor, a physicist at the University of Maryland who was not involved with the projects. Whatever future difficulties arise, he says, scientists are learning valuable information about one of the most fundamental aspects of physics. Everything we know about quantum mechanics would lead us to believe that large-scale quantum computers should be theoretically possible. But even if ""you couldn't build a large-scale quantum computer,"" he says, ""that's somewhat exciting, too. That tells us that our theory of quantum mechanics might be breaking down somewhere, that we still have much to learn.""",7152,"['cgp4ajp', 'cgp5ksq', 'cgp7yqo', 'cgpla1e', 'cgp4aqm', 'cgp3xgb', 'cgp314m', 'cgp57y7', 'cgpdj3j', 'cgp7xuo', 'cgpodpd', 'cgpqjxp', 'cgq60q6', 'cgpfmk9', 'cgp2jf4', 'cgp1npb', 'cgp0vv4', 'cgp7a6h', 'cgpcwng', 'cgpn2la', 'cgpncc4', 'cgrqh7a', 'cgp8hwk', 'cgpc2ja', 'cgpd5k8', 'cgpl6cr', 'cgpl988', 'cgp2dlc', 'cgpvzhm', 'cgp5bqg', 'cgp7cj5', 'cgpaaek', 'cgpcfc2', 'cgpft7v', 'cgppea3', 'cgp6ycw', 'cgpj4wc']"

(PhysOrg.com) -- A primitive quantum computer that uses single particles of light (photons) whizzing through a silicon chip has performed its first mathematical calculation. This is the first time a calculation has been performed on a photonic chip and it is major step forward in the quest to realise a super-powerful quantum computer.
The chip takes four photons that carry the input for the calculation, it then implements a quantum programme (Shor’s algorithm) to find the prime factors of 15, and outputs the answer - 3 and 5. The results are reported by a team of physicists and engineers from the University of Bristol in today’s issue of Science.
“This task could be done much faster by any school kid,” said PhD student, Alberto Politi, who, together with fellow PhD student Jonathan Matthews performed the experiment, “but this is a really important proof-of-principle demonstration.”
Finding prime factors may seem like a mathematical abstraction, but it lies at the heart of modern encryption schemes, including those used for secure internet communication. The ability of quantum computers to simulate quantum systems may also prove to be a powerful tool in the development of new materials or pharmaceuticals.
The team from the University of Bristol’s newly established Centre for Nanoscience and Quantum Information have spent several years developing devices where photons propagate in silica waveguides — much like in optical fibres — micro-fabricated on a silicon chip.
“This approach results in miniature, high-performance and scalable devices,” said Professor Jeremy O’Brien, Director of the Centre for Quantum Photonics, who led the research. “The realisation of a quantum algorithm on a chip is an extremely important step towards an all-optical quantum computer”
“Despite recent advances, the ability to perform even small-scale quantum algorithms has largely been missing,” said Matthews. “For the last few years, researchers at the Centre for Quantum Photonics have been working towards building fully functional quantum circuits on a chip to solve this issue,” added O’Brien.
The team coupled four photons into and out of the chip using optical fibres. On the chip the photons traveled through silica waveguides that were brought together to form a sequence of quantum logic gates. The output was determined by which waveguides the photons exited the chip in. By detecting the photons at the output of the device they confirmed high-performance operation of the quantum algorithm.
“As well as quantum computing and quantum metrology, ‘on-chip’ photonic quantum circuits could have important applications in quantum communication, since they can be easily integrated with optical fibres to send photons between remote locations,” said Politi.
O’Brien concurred and added: “The really exciting thing about this result is that it will enable the development of large scale quantum circuits for photons. This opens up all kinds of possibilities”.

That's a big deal.",,2019-10-02,Jennifer Leman,A Quantum Leap in the Classical World,"Physicists have long struggled with a perplexing conundrum: Why do tiny particles such as atoms, photons, and electrons behave in ways that bacteria, bees, and bowling balls do not? In a phenomenon called quantum superposition, for example, individual units (say, of light) exist in two states at once. They are both waves and particles, only settling on one or the other if you specifically test for it.
This is not something that will happen to an object like your desk. It won’t turn solid when you set your coffee cup on it, or liquid if you try to drink it. Superposition has only been observed in the smallest units of matter, which made physicist Markus Arndt of the University of Vienna curious about where the line is. Does quantum weirdness stop at some particular size? If so, which?
To find out, Arndt and his team created a souped-up version of the famed double-slit experiment (see below), which can show whether individual particles are also behaving like waves. Then they worked their way toward increasingly massive objects. The synthetic molecules Arndt’s colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland developed for the study are the largest particles ever tested in such an experiment. Each contained as many as 2,000 atoms, according to research published in the journal Nature Physics. The molecules, which have a mouthful of a chemical formula (C707H260F908N16S53Zn4), “had to be massive, stable, and yet volatile enough to fly in a directed beam,” Arndt says.
Next, the scientists built a special instrument, a macromolecule interferometer called the Long-Baseline Universal Matter-Wave Interferometer, or LUMI. With a baseline length of two meters, it’s the longest macromolecule interferometer ever built and is specially tuned to compensate for a number of technical challenges (for example, gravity and the rotation of the Earth).
Inside the interferometer, the team used a nanosecond laser pulse of light to propel the molecules through an ultra-high vacuum tube, which shot them toward a series of slotted barriers to reveal patterns in a screen behind. To Ardnt’s delight, the mammoth molecules created the same interference pattern as smaller objects. Though they were particles, they were also acting like waves.
In 1801, physicist Thomas Young conducted the first double-slit experiment, shooting a beam of light toward a barrier with two slits in it. Instead of forming two lines on a screen behind the barrier—in the same way that particles might—the beam formed a pattern of interference as if a wave had been pushed through the two slits. In 1908, Geoffrey Ingram Taylor repeated the experiment using a single photon. Even though the photon was a single particle, the wave interference pattern still appeared. That was strange enough, but then it got really weird: When scientists tracked the individual particles as they move through the slits, the monitored particles abandoned their wave-like state and showed up as two separate lines on the screen. It’s as if they knew they were being watched.
The push and pull between what we know of the quantum and classical worlds has perplexed physicists for nearly a century. Concepts such as superposition are cornerstones of quantum physics. “And yet, we never find ourselves in such states that we colloquially describe as an object being in two positions at once,” Arndt says.
In the hunt for a connection between the quantum and classical world, Arndt aims to push the limits even further, testing larger and more massive particles. “Why not see how far you can go?” physicist Herman Batelaan of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, who was not involved in the study, tells Popular Mechanics. “It’s a beautiful motivation to do this work.”",3732,"['f2cbbet', 'f2c18n0', 'f2d1u12', 'f2bst0z', 'f2djls8', 'f2da7be', 'f2cfdhi', 'f2bqn2m', 'f2ddrms', 'f2exxej', 'f2dc30q']"

Physicists have purportedly created the first-ever wormhole, a kind of tunnel theorized in 1935 by Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen that leads from one place to another by passing into an extra dimension of space.
The wormhole emerged like a hologram out of quantum bits of information, or “qubits,” stored in tiny superconducting circuits. By manipulating the qubits, the physicists then sent information through the wormhole, they reported today in the journal Nature.
The team, led by Maria Spiropulu of the California Institute of Technology, implemented the novel “wormhole teleportation protocol” using Google’s quantum computer, a device called Sycamore housed at Google Quantum AI in Santa Barbara, California. With this first-of-its-kind “quantum gravity experiment on a chip,” as Spiropulu described it, she and her team beat a competing group of physicists who aim to do wormhole teleportation with IBM and Quantinuum’s quantum computers.
When Spiropulu saw the key signature indicating that qubits were passing through the wormhole, she said, “I was shaken.”
The experiment can be seen as evidence for the holographic principle, a sweeping hypothesis about how the two pillars of fundamental physics, quantum mechanics and general relativity, fit together. Physicists have strived since the 1930s to reconcile these disjointed theories — one, a rulebook for atoms and subatomic particles, the other, Einstein’s description of how matter and energy warp the space-time fabric, generating gravity. The holographic principle, ascendant since the 1990s, posits a mathematical equivalence or “duality” between the two frameworks. It says the bendy space-time continuum described by general relativity is really a quantum system of particles in disguise. Space-time and gravity emerge from quantum effects much as a 3D hologram projects out of a 2D pattern.
Introduction
Indeed, the new experiment confirms that quantum effects, of the type that we can control in a quantum computer, can give rise to a phenomenon that we expect to see in relativity — a wormhole. The evolving system of qubits in the Sycamore chip “has this really cool alternative description,” said John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at Caltech who was not involved in the experiment. “You can think of the system in a very different language as being gravitational.”
To be clear, unlike an ordinary hologram, the wormhole isn’t something we can see. While it can be considered “a filament of real space-time,” according to co-author Daniel Jafferis of Harvard University, lead developer of the wormhole teleportation protocol, it’s not part of the same reality that we and the Sycamore computer inhabit. The holographic principle says that the two realities — the one with the wormhole and the one with the qubits — are alternate versions of the same physics, but how to conceptualize this kind of duality remains mysterious.
Opinions will differ about the fundamental implications of the result. Crucially, the holographic wormhole in the experiment consists of a different kind of space-time than the space-time of our own universe. It’s debatable whether the experiment furthers the hypothesis that the space-time we inhabit is also holographic, patterned by quantum bits.
“I think it is true that gravity in our universe is emergent from some quantum [bits] in the same way that this little baby one-dimensional wormhole is emergent” from the Sycamore chip, Jafferis said. “Of course we don’t know that for sure. We’re trying to understand it.”
Into the Wormhole
The story of the holographic wormhole traces back to two seemingly unrelated papers published in 1935: one by Einstein and Rosen, known as ER, the other by the two of them and Boris Podolsky, known as EPR. Both the ER and EPR papers were initially judged as marginal works of the great E. That has changed.
In the ER paper, Einstein and his young assistant, Rosen, stumbled upon the possibility of wormholes while attempting to extend general relativity into a unified theory of everything — a description not only of space-time, but of the subatomic particles suspended in it. They had homed in on snags in the space-time fabric that the German physicist-soldier Karl Schwarzschild had found among the folds of general relativity in 1916, mere months after Einstein published the theory. Schwarzschild showed that mass can gravitationally attract itself so much that it becomes infinitely concentrated at a point, curving space-time so sharply there that variables turn infinite and Einstein’s equations malfunction. We now know that these “singularities” exist throughout the universe. They are points we can neither describe nor see, each one hidden at the center of a black hole that gravitationally traps all nearby light. Singularities are where a quantum theory of gravity is most needed.
Introduction
Einstein and Rosen speculated that Schwarzschild’s math might be a way to plug elementary particles into general relativity. To make the picture work, they snipped the singularity out of his equations, swapping in new variables that replaced the sharp point with an extra-dimensional tube sliding to another part of space-time. Einstein and Rosen argued, wrongly but presciently, that these “bridges” (or wormholes) might represent particles.
Ironically, in striving to link wormholes and particles, the duo did not consider the strange particle phenomenon they had identified two months earlier with Podolsky, in the EPR paper: quantum entanglement.
Entanglement arises when two particles interact. According to quantum rules, particles can have multiple possible states at once. This means an interaction between particles has multiple possible outcomes, depending on which state each particle is in to begin with. Always, though, their resulting states will be linked — how particle A ends up depends on how particle B turns out. After such an interaction, the particles have a shared formula that specifies the various combined states they might be in.
The shocking consequence, which caused the EPR authors to doubt quantum theory, is “spooky action at a distance,” as Einstein put it: Measuring particle A (which picks out one reality from among its possibilities) instantly decides the corresponding state of B, no matter how far away B is.
Entanglement has shot up in perceived importance since physicists discovered in the 1990s that it allows new kinds of computations. Entangling two qubits — quantum objects like particles that exist in two possible states, 0 and 1 — yields four possible states with different likelihoods (0 and 0, 0 and 1, 1 and 0, and 1 and 1). Three qubits make eight simultaneous possibilities, and so on; the power of a “quantum computer” grows exponentially with each additional entangled qubit. Cleverly orchestrate the entanglement, and you can cancel out all combinations of 0s and 1s except the sequence that gives the answer to a calculation. Prototype quantum computers made of a few dozen qubits have materialized in the last couple of years, led by Google’s 54-qubit Sycamore machine.
Meanwhile, quantum gravity researchers have fixated on quantum entanglement for another reason: as the possible source code of the space-time hologram.
ER = EPR
Talk of emergent space-time and holography started in the late 1980s, after the black hole theorist John Wheeler promulgated the view that space-time and everything in it might spring from information. Soon, other researchers, including the Dutch physicist Gerard ’t Hooft, wondered whether this emergence might resemble the projection of a hologram. Examples had cropped up in black hole studies and in string theory, where one description of a physical scenario could be translated into an equally valid view of it with one extra spatial dimension. In a 1994 paper titled “The World as a Hologram,” Leonard Susskind, a quantum gravity theorist at Stanford University, fleshed out ’t Hooft’s holographic principle, arguing that a volume of bendy space-time described by general relativity is equivalent, or “dual,” to a system of quantum particles on the region’s lower-dimensional boundary.
A momentous example of holography arrived three years later. Juan Maldacena, a quantum gravity theorist now at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, discovered that a kind of space called anti-de Sitter (AdS) space is, indeed, a hologram.
Introduction
The actual universe is de Sitter space, an ever-growing sphere driven outward by its own positive energy. By contrast, AdS space is infused with negative energy — resulting from a difference in the sign of one constant in the equations of general relativity — giving the space a “hyperbolic” geometry: Objects shrink as they move outward from the center of the space, becoming infinitesimal at an outer boundary. Maldacena showed that space-time and gravity inside an AdS universe exactly correspond to properties of a quantum system on the boundary (specifically a system called a conformal field theory, or CFT).
Maldacena’s bombshell 1997 paper describing this “AdS/CFT correspondence” has been cited by subsequent studies 22,000 times — more than twice a day on average. “Trying to exploit ideas based on AdS/CFT has been the main goal of thousands of the best theorists for decades,” said Peter Woit, a mathematical physicist at Columbia University.
As Maldacena himself explored his AdS/CFT map between dynamical space-times and quantum systems, he made a new discovery about wormholes. He was studying a particular entanglement pattern involving two sets of particles, where each particle in one set is entangled with a particle in the other. Maldacena showed that this state is mathematically dual to a rather dramatic hologram: a pair of black holes in AdS space whose interiors connect via a wormhole.
A decade had to pass before Maldacena, in 2013 (under circumstances that “to be frank, I do not remember,” he says), realized that his discovery might signify a more general correspondence between quantum entanglement and connection via wormhole. He coined a cryptic little equation — ER = EPR — in an email to Susskind, who understood immediately. The two quickly developed the conjecture together, writing, “We argue that the Einstein Rosen bridge between two black holes is created by EPR-like correlations between the microstates of the two black holes,” and that the duality might be more general than that: “It is very tempting to think that any EPR correlated system is connected by some sort of ER bridge.”
Maybe a wormhole links every entangled pair of particles in the universe, forging a spatial connection that records their shared histories. Maybe Einstein’s hunch that wormholes have to do with particles was right.
A Sturdy Bridge
When Jafferis heard Maldacena lecture about ER = EPR at a conference in 2013, he realized that the conjectured duality should allow you to design bespoke wormholes by tailoring the entanglement pattern.
Standard Einstein-Rosen bridges are a disappointment to sci-fi fans everywhere: Were one to form, it would quickly collapse under its own gravity and pinch off long before a spaceship or anything else could get through. But Jafferis imagined stringing a wire or any other physical connection between the two sets of entangled particles that encode a wormhole’s two mouths. With this kind of coupling, operating on the particles on one side would induce changes to the particles on the other, perhaps propping open the wormhole between them. “Could it be that that makes the wormhole traversable?” Jafferis recalls wondering. Having been fascinated by wormholes since childhood — a physics prodigy, he started at Yale University at 14 — Jafferis pursued the question “almost for fun.”
Introduction
Back at Harvard, he and Ping Gao, his graduate student at the time, and Aron Wall, then a visiting researcher, eventually calculated that, indeed, by coupling two sets of entangled particles, you can perform an operation on the left-hand set that, in the dual, higher-dimensional space-time picture, holds open the wormhole leading to the right-hand mouth and pushes a qubit through.
Jafferis, Gao and Wall’s 2016 discovery of this holographic, traversable wormhole gave researchers a new window into the mechanics of holography. “The fact that if you do the right things from the outside you can end up getting through, it also means you can see inside” the wormhole, Jafferis said. “It means that it’s possible to probe this fact that two entangled systems get described by some connected geometry.”
Within months, Maldacena and two colleagues had built on the scheme by showing that the traversable wormhole could be realized in a simple setting — “a quantum system that’s simple enough that we can imagine making it,” Jafferis said.
The SYK model, as it’s called, is a system of matter particles that interact in groups, rather than the usual pairs. First described by Subir Sachdev and Jinwu Ye in 1993, the model suddenly mattered much more starting in 2015 when the theoretical physicist Alexei Kitaev discovered that it is holographic. At a lecture that year in Santa Barbara, California, Kitaev (who became the K in SYK) filled several chalkboards with evidence that the particular version of the model in which matter particles interact in groups of four is mathematically mappable to a one-dimensional black hole in AdS space, with identical symmetries and other properties. “Some answers are the same in the two cases,” he told a rapt audience. Maldacena was sitting in the front row.
Connecting the dots, Maldacena and co-authors proposed that two SYK models linked together could encode the two mouths of Jafferis, Gao and Wall’s traversable wormhole. Jafferis and Gao ran with the approach. By 2019, they found their way to a concrete prescription for teleporting a qubit of information from one system of four-way-interacting particles to another. Rotating all the particles’ spin directions translates, in the dual space-time picture, into a negative-energy shock wave that sweeps through the wormhole, kicking the qubit forward and, at a predictable time, out of the mouth.
“Jafferis’ wormhole is the first concrete realization of ER = EPR, where he shows the relation holds exactly for a particular system,” said Alex Zlokapa, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author on the new experiment.
Wormhole in the Lab
As the theoretical work was developing, Maria Spiropulu, an accomplished experimental particle physicist who was involved in the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson, was thinking about how to use nascent quantum computers to do holographic quantum gravity experiments. In 2018 she persuaded Jafferis to join her growing team, along with researchers at Google Quantum AI — keepers of the Sycamore device.
To run Jafferis and Gao’s wormhole teleportation protocol on the state-of-the-art but still small and error-prone quantum computer, Spiropulu’s team had to greatly simplify the protocol. A full SYK model consists of practically infinitely many particles coupled to one another with random strengths as four-way interactions occur throughout. This is not feasible to calculate; even using all 50-odd available qubits would have required hundreds of thousands of circuit operations. The researchers set out to create a holographic wormhole with just seven qubits and hundreds of operations. To do this, they had to “sparsify” the seven-particle SYK model, encoding only the strongest four-way interactions and eliding the rest, while retaining the model’s holographic properties. “That took a couple of years to figure out a clever way to do it,” Spiropulu said.
Introduction
One secret to success was Zlokapa, a waifish orchestra kid who joined Spiropulu’s research group as a Caltech undergrad. A gifted programmer, Zlokapa mapped the particle interactions of the SYK model onto the connections between neurons of a neural network, and trained the system to delete as many network connections as possible while preserving a key wormhole signature. The procedure reduced the number of four-way interactions from hundreds down to five.
With that, the team started programming Sycamore’s qubits. Seven qubits encode 14 matter particles — seven each in the left and right SYK systems, where every particle on the left is entangled with one on the right. An eighth qubit, in some probabilistic combination of states 0 and 1, is then swapped with one of the particles from the left SYK model. That qubit’s possible states quickly get tangled up with the states of the other particles on the left, spreading its information evenly among them like a drop of ink in water. This is holographically dual to the qubit entering the left mouth of a one-dimensional wormhole in AdS space.
Then comes the big rotation of all the qubits, dual to a pulse of negative energy coursing through the wormhole. The rotation causes the injected qubit to transfer to the particles of the right-hand SYK model. Then the information un-spreads, Preskill said, “like chaos run backward,” and refocuses at the site of a single particle on the right — the entangled partner of the left-hand particle that was swapped out. Then the qubits’ states are all measured. Tallying 0s and 1s over many experimental runs and comparing these statistics to the prepared state of the injected qubits reveals whether qubits are teleporting over.
Introduction
The researchers look for a peak in the data that represents a difference between two cases: If they see the peak, it means qubit rotations that are dual to negative-energy pulses are allowing qubits to teleport, whereas rotations in the opposite direction, which are dual to pulses of normal, positive energy, don’t let qubits through. (Instead, they cause the wormhole to close.)
Late one night in January, after two years of gradual improvements and noise-reduction efforts, Zlokapa ran the finished protocol on Sycamore remotely from his childhood bedroom in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he was spending winter break after his first semester of grad school.
The peak appeared on his computer screen.
“It kept getting sharper and sharper,” he said. “I was sending screenshots of the peak to Maria and getting very excited, writing, ‘I think we see a wormhole now.’” The peak was “the first sign that you could see gravity on a quantum computer.”
Spiropulu says she could hardly believe the clean, pronounced peak she was seeing. “It was very similar to when I saw the first data for the Higgs discovery,” she said. “Not because I didn’t expect it, but it came too much in my face.”
Surprisingly, despite the skeletal simplicity of their wormhole, the researchers detected a second signature of wormhole dynamics, a delicate pattern in the way information spread and un-spread among the qubits known as “size-winding.” They hadn’t trained their neural network to preserve this signal as it sparsified the SYK model, so the fact that size-winding shows up anyway is an experimental discovery about holography.
“We didn’t demand anything about this size-winding property, but we found that it just popped out,” Jafferis said. This “confirmed the robustness” of the holographic duality, he said. “Make one [property] appear, then you get all the rest, which is a kind of evidence that this gravitational picture is the correct one.”
The Meaning of the Wormhole
Jafferis, who never expected to be part of a wormhole experiment (or any other), thinks one of the most important takeaways is what the experiment says about quantum mechanics. Quantum phenomena like entanglement are normally opaque and abstract; we don’t know, for instance, how a measurement of particle A determines B’s state from afar. But in the new experiment, an ineffable quantum phenomenon — information teleporting between particles — has a tangible interpretation as a particle receiving a kick of energy and moving at a calculable speed from A to B. “There seems to be this nice story from the point of view of the qubit; it moves causally,” said Jafferis. Maybe a quantum process like teleportation “always feels gravitational to that qubit. If something like that could come out of this experiment and other related experiments, that will definitely tell us something deep about our universe.”
Introduction
Susskind, who got an early look at today’s results, said he hopes that future wormhole experiments involving many more qubits can be used to explore the wormhole’s interior as a way of investigating the quantum properties of gravity. “By doing measurements on what went through, you interrogate it and see what was in the inside,” he said. “That seems to me like an interesting way to go.”
Some physicists will say the experiment tells us nothing about our universe, since it realizes a duality between quantum mechanics and anti-de Sitter space, which our universe is not.
In the 25 years since Maldacena’s discovery of the AdS/CFT correspondence, physicists have sought a similar holographic duality for de Sitter space — a map going from a quantum system to the positively energized, expanding de Sitter universe we live in. But progress has been far slower than for AdS, leading some to doubt whether de Sitter space is holographic at all. “Questions like ‘What about getting this to work in the more physical case of dS?’ are not new but very old and have been the subject of tens of thousands of person-years of unsuccessful effort,” said Woit, a critic of AdS/CFT research. “What’s needed are some quite different ideas.”
Critics argue that the two kinds of space differ categorically: AdS has an outer boundary and dS space does not, so there’s no smooth mathematical transition that can morph one into the other. And AdS space’s hard boundary is the very thing that makes holography easy in that setting, providing the quantum surface from which to project the space. By comparison, in our de Sitter universe, the only boundaries are the farthest we can see and the infinite future. These are hazy surfaces from which to try projecting a space-time hologram.
Renate Loll, a noted quantum gravity theorist at Radboud University in the Netherlands, also emphasized that the wormhole experiment concerns 2D space-time — the wormhole is a filament, with one spatial dimension plus the time dimension — whereas gravity is more complicated in the 4D space-time that we actually live in. “It is rather tempting to get entangled in the intricacies of the 2D toy models,” she said by email, “while losing sight of the different and bigger challenges that await us in 4D quantum gravity. For that theory, I cannot see how quantum computers with their current capabilities can be of much help … but I will happily stand corrected.”
Most quantum gravity researchers believe these are all difficult but solvable problems — that the entanglement pattern that weaves 4D de Sitter space is more complicated than for 2D AdS, but we can nevertheless extract general lessons by studying holography in simpler settings. This camp tends to see the two types of space, dS and AdS, as more similar than different. Both are solutions to Einstein’s relativity theory, differing only by a minus sign. Both dS and AdS universes contain black holes that are stricken with the same paradoxes. And when you’re deep in AdS space, far from its outer wall, you can hardly distinguish your surroundings from de Sitter.
Still, Susskind agrees that it’s time to get real. “I think it’s about time we got out from under the protective layer of AdS space and open up into the world that might have more to do with cosmology,” he said. “De Sitter space is another beast.”
To that end, Susskind has a new idea. In a preprint posted online in September, he proposed that de Sitter space might be a hologram of a different version of the SYK model — not the one with four-way particle interactions, but one in which the number of particles involved in each interaction grows as the square root of the total number of particles. This “double-scaled limit” of the SYK model is “behaving more like de Sitter than AdS,” he said. “There’s far from a proof, but there is circumstantial evidence.”
Such a quantum system is more complex than the one programmed so far, and “whether that limit is something that will be realized in the lab I don’t know,” Susskind said.

A teenager from Texas has taken quantum computing down a notch. In a paper posted online earlier this month, 18-year-old Ewin Tang proved that ordinary computers can solve an important computing problem with performance potentially comparable to that of a quantum computer.
In its most practical form, the “recommendation problem” relates to how services like Amazon and Netflix determine which products you might like to try. Computer scientists had considered it to be one of the best examples of a problem that’s exponentially faster to solve on quantum computers — making it an important validation of the power of these futuristic machines. Now Tang has stripped that validation away.
“This was one of the most definitive examples of a quantum speedup, and it’s no longer there,” said Tang, who graduated from the University of Texas, Austin, in spring and will begin a Ph.D. at the University of Washington in the fall.
In 2014, at age 14 and after skipping the fourth through sixth grades, Tang enrolled at UT Austin and majored in mathematics and computer science. In the spring of 2017 Tang took a class on quantum information taught by Scott Aaronson, a prominent researcher in quantum computing. Aaronson recognized Tang as an unusually talented student and offered himself as adviser on an independent research project. Aaronson gave Tang a handful of problems to choose from, including the recommendation problem. Tang chose it somewhat reluctantly.
“I was hesitant because it seemed like a hard problem when I looked at it, but it was the easiest of the problems he gave me,” Tang said.
The recommendation problem is designed to give a recommendation for products that users will like. Consider the case of Netflix. It knows what films you’ve watched. It knows what all of its other millions of users have watched. Given this information, what are you likely to want to watch next?
You can think of this data as being arranged in a giant grid, or matrix, with movies listed across the top, users listed down the side, and values at points in the grid quantifying whether, or to what extent, each user likes each film. A good algorithm would generate recommendations by quickly and accurately recognizing similarities between movies and users and filling in the blanks in the matrix.
In 2016 the computer scientists Iordanis Kerenidis and Anupam Prakash published a quantum algorithm that solved the recommendation problem exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm. They achieved this quantum speedup in part by simplifying the problem: Instead of filling out the entire matrix and identifying the single best product to recommend, they developed a way of sorting users into a small number of categories — do they like blockbusters or indie films? — and sampling the existing data in order to generate a recommendation that was simply good enough.
At the time of Kerenidis and Prakash’s work, there were only a few examples of problems that quantum computers seemed to be able to solve exponentially faster than classical computers. Most of those examples were specialized — they were narrow problems designed to play to the strengths of quantum computers (these include the “forrelation” problem Quanta covered earlier this year). Kerenidis and Prakash’s result was exciting because it provided a real-world problem people cared about where quantum computers outperformed classical ones.
“To my sense it was one of the first examples in machine learning and big data where we showed quantum computers can do something that we still don’t know how to do classically,” said Kerenidis, a computer scientist at the Research Institute on the Foundations of Computer Science in Paris.
Kerenidis and Prakash proved that a quantum computer could solve the recommendation problem exponentially faster than any known algorithm, but they didn’t prove that a fast classical algorithm couldn’t exist. So when Aaronson began working with Tang in 2017, that was the question he posed — prove there is no fast classical recommendation algorithm, and thereby confirm Kerenidis and Prakash’s quantum speedup is real.
“That seemed to me like an important ‘t’ to cross to complete this story,” said Aaronson, who believed at the time that no fast classical algorithm existed.
Tang set to work in the fall of 2017, intending for the recommendation problem to serve as a senior thesis. For several months Tang struggled to prove that a fast classical algorithm was impossible. As time went on, Tang started to think that maybe such an algorithm was possible after all.
“I started believing there is a fast classical algorithm, but I couldn’t really prove it to myself because Scott seemed to think there wasn’t one, and he was the authority,” Tang said.
Finally, with the senior thesis deadline bearing down, Tang wrote to Aaronson and admitted a growing suspicion: “Tang wrote to me saying, actually, ‘I think there is a fast classical algorithm,’” Aaronson said.
Throughout the spring Tang wrote up the results and worked with Aaronson to clarify some steps in the proof. The fast classical algorithm Tang found was directly inspired by the fast quantum algorithm Kerenidis and Prakash had found two years earlier. Tang showed that the kind of quantum sampling techniques they used in their algorithm could be replicated in a classical setting. Like Kerenidis and Prakash’s algorithm, Tang’s algorithm ran in polylogarithmic time — meaning the computational time scaled with the logarithm of characteristics like the number of users and products in the data set — and was exponentially faster than any previously known classical algorithm.
Once Tang had completed the algorithm, Aaronson wanted to be sure it was correct before releasing it publicly. “I was still nervous that once Tang put the paper online, if it’s wrong, the first big paper of [Tang’s] career would go splat,” Aaronson said.
Aaronson had been planning to attend a quantum computing workshop at the University of California, Berkeley, in June. Many of the biggest names in the field were going to be there, including Kerenidis and Prakash. Aaronson invited Tang to come out to Berkeley to informally present the algorithm in the days after the official conference ended.
On the mornings of June 18 and 19 Tang gave two lectures while fielding questions from the audience. By the end of four hours, a consensus emerged: Tang’s classical algorithm seemed correct. What many people in the room didn’t realize, however, was just how young the speaker was. “I did not know Ewin was 18, and I certainly did not get that from the talk. To me [Ewin] was someone who was giving a very mature talk,” Kerenidis said. The algorithm now faces a formal peer review before publication.
For quantum computing, Tang’s result is a setback. Or not. Tang has eliminated one of the clearest, best examples of a quantum advantage. At the same time, Tang’s paper is further evidence of the fruitful interplay between the study of quantum and classical algorithms.
“Tang is killing [Kerenidis and Prakash’s] quantum speedup, but then in another sense Tang is giving a big improvement and building on what they did. Tang never would have come up with this classical algorithm but for their quantum algorithm,” Aaronson said.",7289,"['e3ek1ze', 'e3ekyso', 'e3fl3lb', 'e3enhxu', 'e3e4eov']"

Quantum teleportation achieved over 16 km
(PhysOrg.com) -- Scientists in China have succeeded in teleporting information between photons further than ever before. They transported quantum information over a free space distance of 16 km (10 miles), much further than the few hundred meters previously achieved, which brings us closer to transmitting information over long distances without the need for a traditional signal.
Quantum teleportation is not the same as the teleportation most of us know from science fiction, where an object (or person) in one place is “beamed up” to another place where a perfect copy is replicated. In quantum teleportation two photons or ions (for example) are entangled in such a way that when the quantum state of one is changed the state of the other also changes, as if the two were still connected. This enables quantum information to be teleported if one of the photons/ions is sent some distance away.
In previous experiments the photons were confined to fiber channels a few hundred meters long to ensure their state remained unchanged, but in the new experiments pairs of photons were entangled and then the higher-energy photon of the pair was sent through a free space channel 16 km long. The researchers, from the University of Science and Technology of China and Tsinghua University in Beijing, found that even at this distance the photon at the receiving end still responded to changes in state of the photon remaining behind. The average fidelity of the teleportation achieved was 89 percent.
The distance of 16 km is greater than the effective aerosphere thickness of 5-10 km, so the group's success could pave the way for experiments between a ground station and a satellite, or two ground stations with a satellite acting as a relay. This means quantum communication applications could be possible on a global scale in the near future.
The public free space channel was at ground level and spanned the 16 km distance between Badaling in Beijing (the teleportation site) and the receiver site at Huailai in Hebei province. Entangled photon pairs were generated at the teleportation site using a semiconductor, a blue laser beam, and a crystal of beta-barium borate (BBO). The pairs of photons were entangled in the spatial modes of photon 1 and polarization modes of photon 2. The research team designed two types of telescopes to serve as optical transmitting and receiving antennas.

Absolutely, according to a new experiment carried out between satellites in orbit and a station on the ground.
The team of scientists was able to exchange several carefully managed photons in pulses of infrared light, carried between Russian GLONASS satellites and the Space Geodesy Centre on the ground run by the Italian Space Agency.
Getting these signals to pass through some 20,000 kilometres (12,427 miles) of air and space without any interference or data loss is no easy task – but the signs are promising that such a global network could indeed be functional.
""Space quantum communications (QC) represent a promising way to guarantee unconditional security for satellite-to-ground and inter-satellite optical links, by using quantum information protocols as quantum key distribution (QKD),"" says one of the researchers, Giuseppe Vallone from the University of Padova in Italy.
The quantum key distribution or QKD method Vallone mentions refers to data encrypted using the power of quantum mechanics: thanks to the delicate nature of the technology, any interference is quickly detected, making QKD communications impossible to intercept.
In fact, hacking into a quantum mechanics message would cause it to self-destruct.
So far so good in theory, but keeping these secure channels open across long distances has proved tricky.
The key to the successful data exchange here was the use of passive retro-reflectors mounted on the satellites to keep the long-distance light signals intact, breaking the previous record distance for this type of quantum communication by an extra 15,000 kilometres (9,321 miles).
While satellites placed higher in orbit, like the GLONASS ones, are more difficult to communicate reliably with, they pass within sight of ground stations more regularly, potentially enabling an unhackable quantum network that can span the globe.
We're only just getting started with this type of technology – not least because scientists are still trying to figure out if it can actually work – and for the moment it's not clear exactly what a quantum internet would be used for or how it might be operated.
One idea is that it might become a specialised, very secure extension to the normal internet, used by a small selection of apps and devices.
What we do now know is that quantum communications are possible between the ground and high orbit satellites, extending the potential reach of the new technology.
That's important as the satellite networks we rely on continue to get developed and upgraded.
""Satellite-based technologies enable a wide range of civil, scientific and military applications like communications, navigation and timing, remote sensing, meteorology, reconnaissance, search and rescue, space exploration and astronomy,"" says Vallone.
""The core of these systems is to safely transmit information and data from orbiting satellites to ground stations on Earth. Protection of these channels from a malicious adversary is therefore crucial for both military and civilian operations.""

Now, a team of researchers has put together a mathematical model showing aliens could potentially be communicating across space – via quantum physics.
Efforts are well underway to make quantum communications a reality here on Earth. The idea is that quantum mechanics provide certain properties that would make information transfer inherently faster and more secure than regular systems… if we can get it to work.
One of the major hurdles to overcome before quantum networks can be established is that they're very fragile and susceptible to interference. According to this latest study, such networks could fly across space without breaking up.
""Quantum states you generally think of as very delicate, and if there's any kind of external interaction, you kind of destroy that state,"" lead author of the research, theoretical physicist Arjun Berera from the University of Edinburgh in the UK, told Science News.
Berera and his colleague Jaime Calderón-Figueroa, a fellow theoretical physicist at the University of Edinburgh, ran calculations on the movement of X-rays across the emptiness of space to check for potential decoherence (the breaking up of the quantum state).
If photons – particles of light – were used as the quantum particles, the researchers determined, they could be beamed across hundreds of thousands of light-years at least, a greater stretch of distance than the entire Milky Way galaxy.
That's partly because the average density of matter in space is much less than it is on Earth, and this 'cleaner' environment means less chance of interference. Even gravitational pulls wouldn't be enough to knock a quantum communication network off course.
""It is plausible that quantum communication mediated by photons could be established across interstellar distances, in particular for photons in the X-ray region below the electron mass,"" write the researchers in their published paper.
That alien life forms might be using quantum networks to speak to each other or to try and get in touch with us is, of course, pure speculation – but at the same time it gives astronomers another potential sign of life they can monitor for.
The ""considerable information transfer"" possible with a quantum signal would make it attractive to any extraterrestrial intelligence out there in the cosmos, the researchers say, though it may require a fully functioning quantum computer in order to decode it.
And even quantum communication isn't magic: Information still can't travel faster than the speed of light, so transmissions may take several years to reach their destinations.
Based on these findings, we can now add quantum communication as well as classical communication to the possible ways aliens might be chatting with each other – or perhaps might be trying to make themselves known to us.
""In principle, it should be possible to detect a quantum signal coming from an astrophysical body or even an intelligent signal from an extraterrestrial civilization,"" write the researchers.

This is the essence of the Fermi Paradox, a question that has plagued astronomers and cosmologists almost since the birth of modern astronomy.
It is also the reasoning behind the Hart-Tipler Conjecture, one of the many (many!) proposed resolutions, which asserts that if advanced life had emerged in our galaxy sometime in the past, we would see signs of their activity everywhere we looked. Possible indications include self-replicating probes, megastructures, and other Type III-like activity.
On the other hand, several proposed resolutions challenge the notion that advanced life would operate on such massive scales. Others suggest that advanced extraterrestrial civilizations would be engaged in activities and locales that would make them less noticeable.
This makes sense from a computing standpoint and offers an explanation for the apparent lack of activity we see when we look at the cosmos.
The research was conducted by Gia Dvali, a theoretical physicist with the Max Planck Institute for Physics and the physics chair at Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich, and Zaza Osmanov, a professor of physics at the Free University of Tbilisi, and a researcher with the Kharadze Georgian National Astrophysical Observatory and the SETI Institute.
The paper that describes their findings recently appeared online and is being reviewed for publication in the International Journal of Astrobiology.
The first SETI survey (Project Ozma) was conducted in 1960 and was led by famed astrophysicist Dr. Frank Drake (who proposed the Drake Equation). This survey relied on the Green Bank Observatory's 26-meter (85-foot) radio telescope to listen for radio transmissions from the nearby star systems of Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani.
Since then, the vast majority of SETI projects have been geared towards the search for radio technosignatures, owing to the ability of radio waves to propagate through interstellar space. As Dvali and Osmanov explained to Universe Today via email:
""Currently, we are mainly looking for radio messages, and there have been several attempts to study the sky for finding the so-called Dyson sphere candidates – megastructures built around stars. On the other hand, the problem of SETI is so complex that one should test all possible channels.
""A whole ""spectrum"" of technosignatures might be much wider: for instance, the infrared or optical emission from megastructures also built around pulsars, white dwarfs, and black holes. A completely new ""direction"" must be the search for an anomalous spectral variability of these technosignatures, which might distinguish them from normal astrophysical objects.""
For many researchers, this limited focus is one of the main reasons SETI has failed to find any evidence of technosignatures. In recent years, astronomers and astrophysicists have recommended extending the search by looking for other technosignatures and methods – such as Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI).
These include directed energy (lasers), neutrino emissions, quantum communications, and gravitational waves, many of which are spelled out in the NASA Technosignature Report (released in 2018) and at the TechnoClimes 2020 workshop.
For their study, Dvali and Osmanov suggest looking for something altogether different: evidence of large-scale quantum computing. The benefits of quantum computing are well-documented, which include the ability to process information exponentially faster than digital computing and being immune to decryption.
Given the rate at which quantum computing is advancing today, it is entirely logical to assume that an advanced civilization could adapt this technology to a much grander scale. Said Dvali and Osmanov:
""No matter how advanced is a civilization or how different is their particle composition and chemistry from ours, we are unified by laws of quantum physics and gravity. These laws tell us that the most efficient storers of quantum information are black holes.
""Although our recent studies show that theoretically, there may exist devices created by non-gravitational interactions that also saturate the capacity of information storage (so-called ""saturons""), the black holes are the clear champions. Correspondingly, any sufficiently advanced ETI is expected to use them for information storage and processing.""
This idea builds on the work of Nobel-prize winner Roger Penrose, who famously proposed that limitless energy could be extracted from a black hole by tapping into the ergosphere. This space lies just outside the event horizon, where infalling matter forms a disk that is accelerated to near the speed of light and emits tremendous amounts of radiation.
Several researchers have suggested that this may be the ultimate power source for advanced ETIs, either by feeding matter onto an SMBH (and harnessing the resulting radiation) or simply harnessing the energy they already put out.
Two possibilities for this latter scenario involve harnessing the angular momentum of their accretions disks (the ""Penrose Process"") or capturing the heat and energy generated by their hypervelocity jets (perhaps in the form of a Dyson Sphere).
In their later paper, Dvali and Osamov suggest that black holes could be the ultimate source of computation. This is based on the notions that: a) a civilization's advancement is directly correlated to its level of computational performance, and b) that there exist certain universal markers of computational advancement which can be used as potential technosignatures
for SETI.
Using the principles of quantum mechanics, Dvali and Osomanov explained how black holes would be the most efficient capacitors for quantum information. These black holes would likely be artificial in nature and micro-sized rather than large and naturally occurring (for the sake of computing efficiency).
As a result, they argue, these black holes would be more energetic than naturally-occurring ones:
""By analyzing the simple scaling properties of information retrieval time, we showed that the optimization of the information volume and processing time suggests that it is maximally beneficial for ETI to invest energy in the creation of many microscopic black holes as opposed to a few large ones.
""First, the micro-black holes radiate with much higher intensity and in the higher energy spectrum of Hawking radiation. Secondly, such black holes must be manufactured by means of high-energy particle collisions in accelerators. This manufacturing necessarily provides an accompanying high-energy radiation signature.""
Hawking radiation, named in honor of the late and great Stephen Hawking, is theorized to be released just outside the event horizon of a black hole due to relativistic quantum effects. The emission of this radiation reduces the mass and rotational energy of black holes, theoretically resulting in their eventual evaporation.
The resulting Hawking radiation, said Dvali and Osomanov, would be ""democratic"" in nature, meaning that it would produce many different species of subatomic particles that are detectable by modern instruments:
""The great thing about Hawking radiation is that it is universal in all the existing particle species. Thereby, ETI quantum computers must radiate ""ordinary"" particles such as neutrinos and photons. Neutrinos, in particular, are excellent messengers due to their extraordinary penetration ability, which avoids the possibility of screening.
""This, in particular, offers novel fingerprints of ETI in the form of a flux of very high energy neutrinos coming both from Hawking radiation of information storing micro black holes as well as from the collision 'factories' that manufacture them. The Hawking component of radiation is expected to be a superposition of black body spectra of very high energies.
""In the paper, we have shown that the IceCube observatory can potentially observe such technosignatures. However, this is just one potential example of a very exciting new direction for SETI.""
In many respects, this theory echoes the logic of the Barrow Scale, proposed by astrophysicist and mathematician John D. Barrow in 1998. A revision of the Kardashev Scale, the Barrow Scale suggests that civilizations should be characterized not by their physical mastery of outer space (i.e., planet, solar system, galaxy, etc.) but of inner space – i.e., the molecular, atomic, and quantum realms.
This Scale is central to the Transcension Hypothesis, a proposed resolution to Fermi's Paradox that suggests that ETIs would have ""transcended"" beyond anything we would recognize.
Herein lies another exciting aspect of this theory, which is how it offers another possible resolution to the Fermi Paradox. As they explained:
""Up until now, we have completely overlooked a natural direction for SETI in form of high energy neutrinos and other particles produced by the Hawking radiation of artificial black holes. Thereby, various experimental searches for such high energy particles can potentially shed an extremely important light on the presence of advanced ETI within the observable part of the Universe.""
In short, it could be that we see a ""Great Silence"" when we look into the cosmos because we've been looking for the wrong technosignatures.
After all, if extraterrestrial life has had a jump on humanity (which seems reasonable given the age of the Universe), it stands to reason they would have outgrown radio communications and digital computing a long time ago. Another advantage to this theory is that it need not apply to all ETIs to explain why we haven't heard from any civilizations to date.
Given the exponential rate at which computing progresses (using humanity as a template), advanced civilizations might have a short window in which they broadcast in radio wavelengths. This is a key part of the Drake Equation: the L parameter, which refers to the length of time civilizations have to release detectable signals into space.

The findings could teach us a lot about the functions of neurons as well as the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. The research might explain, for example, why our brains are still able to outperform supercomputers on certain tasks, such as making decisions or learning new information.
As with much quantum computing research, the study looks at the idea of entanglement – two separate particles being in states that are linked together
""We adapted an idea, developed for experiments to prove the existence of quantum gravity, whereby you take known quantum systems, which interact with an unknown system,"" says physicist Christian Kerskens from the University of Dublin.
""If the known systems entangle, then the unknown must be a quantum system, too. It circumvents the difficulties to find measuring devices for something we know nothing about.""
In other words, the entanglement or relationship between the known systems can only happen if the mediating system in the middle – the unknown system – operates on a quantum level, too. While the unknown system can't be studied directly, its effects can be observed, as with quantum gravity.
For the purposes of this research, the proton spins of 'brain water' (the fluid that builds up in the brain) act as the known system, with custom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans used to non-invasively measure the proton activity. The spin of a particle, which determines its magnetic and electrical properties, is a quantum-mechanical property.
Through this technique, the researchers were able to see signals resembling heartbeat-evoked potentials, which are a type of electroencephalography (EEG) signal. These signals aren't normally detectable via MRI, and the thinking is that they showed up because the nuclear proton spins in the brain were entangled.
The observations recorded by the team require verification via confirmation via future studies across multiple scientific fields, but the early results look promising for non-classical, quantum happenings in the human brain when it's active.
""If entanglement is the only possible explanation here then that would mean that brain processes must have interacted with the nuclear spins, mediating the entanglement between the nuclear spins,"" says Kerskens.
""As a result, we can deduce that those brain functions must be quantum.""
The brain functions that lit up the MRI readings were also associated with short-term memory and conscious awareness, and that suggests the quantum processes – if that's indeed what they are – play a crucial role in cognition and consciousness, suggests Kerskens.
What researchers need to do next is to learn more about this unknown quantum system in the brain – and then we might fully understand the workings of the quantum computer that we're carrying around in our heads.
""Our experiments, performed only 50 meters away from the lecture theatre where Schrödinger presented his famous thoughts about life, may shed light on the mysteries of biology, and on consciousness which scientifically is even harder to grasp,"" says Kerskens.

The team’s work, published in the journal Nature Physics, lays the groundwork for large-scale integrated photonic quantum technologies for communications and computations.
Quantum teleportation offers quantum state transfer of a quantum particle from one place to another by utilizing entanglement.
Teleportation is not only useful for quantum communication but is a fundamental building-block of optical quantum computing.
Establishing an entangled communication link between two chips in the lab however has proven to be highly challenging.
“We were able to demonstrate a high-quality entanglement link across two chips in the lab, where photons on either chip share a single quantum state,” said study first author Dr. Dan Llewellyn, a researcher in the Quantum Engineering Technology Labs at the University of Bristol.
“Each chip was then fully programmed to perform a range of demonstrations which utilize the entanglement.”
“The flagship demonstration was a two-chip teleportation experiment, whereby the individual quantum state of a particle is transmitted across the two chips after a quantum measurement is performed.”
“This measurement utilizes the strange behavior of quantum physics, which simultaneously collapses the entanglement link and transfers the particle state to another particle already on the receiver chip.”
“Based on our previous result of on-chip high quality single-photon sources, we have built an even more complex circuit containing four sources,” added study co-author Dr. Imad Faruque, also from the Quantum Engineering Technology Labs at the University of Bristol.
“All of these sources are tested and found to be nearly identical emitting nearly identical photons, which is an essential criterion for the set of experiments we had performed, such as entanglement swapping.”
The results showed extremely high-fidelity quantum teleportation of 91%.
In addition, the team was able to demonstrate some other important functionality of their designs, such as entanglement swapping (required for quantum repeaters and quantum networks) and four-photon GHZ states (required in quantum computing and the quantum internet).
“Low loss, high stability, and excellent controllability are extremely important for integrated quantum photonics,” said study co-author Dr. Yunhong Ding, a researcher in the Department of Photonics Engineering and the Center for Silicon Photonics for Optical Communication at Technical University of Denmark.
“In the future, a single silicon-chip integration of quantum photonic devices and classical electronic controls will open the door for fully chip-based CMOS-compatible quantum communication and information processing networks,” said Dr. Jianwei Wang, a scientist at Peking University and corresponding author of the study.

These knots aren't quite the same as the ones you might tie to moor a boat to a jetty - they've been made in a superfluid form of quantum matter called Bose-Einstein Condensate, or BEC, and are more like smoke rings than traditional knots.
""For decades, physicists have been theoretically predicting that it should be possible to have knots in quantum fields, but nobody else has been able to make one,"" said lead researcher, Mikko Möttönen. ""Now that we have seen these exotic beasts, we are really excited to study their peculiar properties. Importantly, our discovery connects to a diverse set of research fields including cosmology, fusion power, and quantum computers.""
These knots of BEC, called knotty solitons, form particle-like rings or loops that roll forward at a constant speed without deforming. When the BEC superfluid is first created, it's made up of a series of points in space all having a specific orientation. The trick of the knotting technique is to change that orientation using very precise magnetic fields - so precise, the scientists conducting the experiment were afraid to move at all.
With it so far? Even if the science is difficult to grasp, the end result is simple enough: tiny knots composed of an interlocking series of circles that look a little like smoke rings or doughnuts. These quantum knots are also topologically stable, which means they can't be undone and must be broken instead. If you think about a shoelace analogy, these particular types of shoelaces can't be pulled apart with your fingers, and have to be cut off with scissors instead.
The tying of the knot takes less than a thousandth of a second, according to Möttönen's research partner, David Hall. ""After we learned how to tie the first quantum knot, we have become rather good at it,"" he said. ""Thus far, we have tied several hundred such knots.""
This is high-level, mind-blowing stuff, and it could be a long time before the results trickle through to everyday life. The researchers believe the discovery might one day help inform the development of quantum computers, where qubits could be braided into different types of knots depending on the task at hand.

Google, NASA, and Lockheed Martin are all customers. The company has publishedarticleson its merits in 60 peer-reviewed scientific journals.
But a very vocal naysayer isn’t on board with the company’s claims—the scientific community.
Scientists accept that D-Wave has built a very fast computer. The controversy lies in D-Wave’s inability to satisfactorily convince physicists that its computer is actually harnessing the mindbending properties of quantum mechanics.
D-Wave CEO Vern Brownell says that scientists are still caught up in the theories of quantum computing, while D-Wave has moved on to practical applications. In the meantime, he said D-Wave’s scientific publications and star-studded customers should speak for themselves.
“We recognize controversy is out there, but the reality of any new groundbreaking technology is that controversy is always going to be out there,” he said.
But according to Christopher Monroe, the Bice Zorn Professor of Physics at the University of Maryland and fellow of the Joint Quantum Institute, it’s not the science community’s burden to prove. D-Wave will have to convince them first.
“It’s incredible they’ve been allowed to take it this far,” he said. “They do publish questionable papers, but they don’t publish data on the foundations of their system because they can’t.”
The Quantum Coffee Cup
Even for physicists, quantum mechanics can be a mind boggling field. Einstein famously thought the theory was too weird to be true. (He was wrong.)
Here’s the simplified theory for newcomers. In quantum mechanics, subatomic particles—and, under certain circumstances, collections of particles that have become “entangled” in a complex way—can have contradictory properties at the same time so long as no one’s looking. But when someone peeks, the system pops into a definite, but randomly determined, state.
This theory is where we get the paradox ofSchrödinger’s cat—a feline trapped in a chamber where a radioactive substance has a 50% chance of emitting a particle that will trigger the release of poison gas. Because that particle emission is a quantum event, the cat is both dead and alive at the same time—at least until someone opens the chamber to check on it.
In classical computing, the smallest denomination of a computer is a bit, which holds a value of 0 or 1. Quantum computing uses a “quantum bit”, called a qubit, which is valued at both 0 and 1 at once. When a qubit has two values at once, it’s said to be in a “quantum state.” If you build a machine with two qubits, it can be valued at 00, 01, 10, and 11 at the same time. As you add qubits, a quantum computer gains vastly more computing power than its classical analogue. Theoretically, at least.
Should it be what the company claims, D-Wave’s computer could be an enormous boon for society, harnessing tandem values to perform multiple equations in parallel, and solving enormous problems that have been too difficult for classical computing. At 512 qubits, it would be the largest ever quantum computer ever conceived. Research scientists who have published their work so far haven’t gotten beyond double digits.
The issue is that building qubits is very difficult, and keeping them in a quantum state is even tougher. According to the laws of quantum mechanics, each time you read data off a qubit—techically, an observation—it decoheres into a non-quantum state. It becomes merely a bit, valued at 0 or 1.
The scientific community accepts two models for building qubits and keeping them in quantum states—gate and adiabatic. D-Wave’s is adiabatic, and so is the 20-qubit model Monroe has in his lab. Adiabatic quantum computers apply quantum annealing—put simply, a strategy for finding the lowest-energy solution to a numerical problem.
There are tests to prove whether qubits reset to quantum, usually by reducing the machine down to two qubits and making a model. Since D-Wave hasn’t chosen to conduct such a test, scientists are skeptical.
“Nobody knows much about D-Wave,” said Duncan Steel, a professor of engineering at the University of Michigan. “The rumor is that they have now sold a few of their machines, but the customers are government funded to evaluate the machine. They won’t tell anyone how the machine works and so, even in principle, no one knows if it is possible that it might actually be a quantum computer.”
Perhaps the biggest breakthrough in D-Wave’s favor came in June when USC researchers published a paper titled “Experimental Signature of Programmable Quantum Annealing” in the peer-reviewed online journal Nature Communications. The paper posits “strong agreement” between a D-Wave machine and the laws of quantum mechanics, but to Monroe it means nothing.
“If you read [the paper], there is nothing in there that requires a quantum description of what’s going on.” he said. “It says that their machine is consistent with certain models based on quantum mechanics. Big deal: I’m quantum too, and so is this coffee cup. But Is there entanglement? Can they use it to compute? It doesn’t say. D-Wave dwells on certain aspects that are consistent with particular quantum models. But there are non-quantum models of what’s happening that describe all their data too.”
Too Good To Be True
The way Brownell describes D-Wave’s product, it sounds like something out of science fiction.
Picture a quantum processor the size of your fingernail, packed with superconducting wires. It sits in a magnetic vacuum, cooled to near absolute zero. It’s programmed by loading a set of mathematical equations into the processor. The processor then moves through near infinite possibilities before determining the lowest energy solution. When it arrives at that, it spits it out as the answer.
It’s a futuristic type of computing that could change the way we evaluate complicated financial or logistical problems. Cancer researchers believe it could be used to determine the behavior of proteins encoded by the human genome.
Based in Vancouver, D-Wave employs 110 people, mostly scientists and engineers, 30 of whom are PhDs. Some focus on nothing but researching papers for publication in scientific journals, the better to finally appeal to the scientific community.
Brownell thinks scientists may be concerned by the D-Wave’s position as a for-profit company, and questions about its quantum state may just be an inability to accept that D-Wave has been able to create something that years of quantum mechanics study has not.
“It’s commercial and it’s a business with the goal to become profitable and fuel scientific research—it’s a very different model than anyone else in the quantum computing community,” he said. “We’ll continue to reach out to the community, and publish papers. It’s hard to do that and build a product at the same time, but I think we’ve done a pretty good job. We’ve built something nobody else has been able to build.”
But D-Wave’s founder, Geordie Rose, takes a more lackadaisical approach. Maybe it doesn’t really matter if the company’s machine is actually a quantum computer or not, he says, if people find it useful.
“Academic groups tend to want to focus more on the quantum part than the computing part, and that’s fine,” he told NPR in May. “It’s just not what we do. What we do is build computers, and if we can build the fastest computers the world has ever known, you can call them whatever you like and I’ll be happy.”
But to Monroe, it does matter. If D-Wave is going to call their machine “the world’s first quantum computer, he wants it to truly be quantum. At its best, D-Wave could change everything. But if it’s not what it says, it could seriously affect the funding of quantum mechanics research.
“In their narrative, I’m a stuffy professor,” he said. “The general public is going to say that professors are conservative and this maverick company is scooping them on everything, and it makes a good story. People could say, ‘Why put money into this field if this small company in Canada already has the technology?’”
Monroe, who has a 20-qubit processor in his lab, knows the amazing potential a 512-qubit computer could offer. But without proof, he thinks D-Wave’s claim is too good to be true. It’s on D-Wave, he says, to finally reduce its processor down to two qubits and show him otherwise.
“The best thing that could happen to my career right now is if something like this were right. If this were true, I’d be the biggest cheerleader. I’d be supporting them in any way I could—if I really thought something was there.”

A team of physicists from the Harvard-MIT Center for Ultracold Atoms and other universities has developed a special type of quantum computer known as a programmable quantum simulator capable of operating with 256 quantum bits, or “qubits.”
The system marks a major step toward building large-scale quantum machines that could be used to shed light on a host of complex quantum processes and eventually help bring about real-world breakthroughs in material science, communication technologies, finance, and many other fields, overcoming research hurdles that are beyond the capabilities of even the fastest supercomputers today. Qubits are the fundamental building blocks on which quantum computers run and the source of their massive processing power.
“This moves the field into a new domain where no one has ever been to thus far,” said Mikhail Lukin, the George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Physics, co-director of the Harvard Quantum Initiative, and one of the senior authors of the study published on July 7, 2021, in the journal Nature. “We are entering a completely new part of the quantum world.”
According to Sepehr Ebadi, a physics student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the study’s lead author, it is the combination of system’s unprecedented size and programmability that puts it at the cutting edge of the race for a quantum computer, which harnesses the mysterious properties of matter at extremely small scales to greatly advance processing power. Under the right circumstances, the increase in qubits means the system can store and process exponentially more information than the classical bits on which standard computers run.
“The number of quantum states that are possible with only 256 qubits exceeds the number of atoms in the solar system,” Ebadi said, explaining the system’s vast size.
Already, the simulator has allowed researchers to observe several exotic quantum states of matter that had never before been realized experimentally, and to perform a quantum phase transition study so precise that it serves as the textbook example of how magnetism works at the quantum level.
These experiments provide powerful insights on the quantum physics underlying material properties and can help show scientists how to design new materials with exotic properties.
The project uses a significantly upgraded version of a platform the researchers developed in 2017, which was capable of reaching a size of 51 qubits. That older system allowed the researchers to capture ultra-cold rubidium atoms and arrange them in a specific order using a one-dimensional array of individually focused laser beams called optical tweezers.
This new system allows the atoms to be assembled in two-dimensional arrays of optical tweezers. This increases the achievable system size from 51 to 256 qubits. Using the tweezers, researchers can arrange the atoms in defect-free patterns and create programmable shapes like square, honeycomb, or triangular lattices to engineer different interactions between the qubits.
“The workhorse of this new platform is a device called the spatial light modulator, which is used to shape an optical wavefront to produce hundreds of individually focused optical tweezer beams,” said Ebadi. “These devices are essentially the same as what is used inside a computer projector to display images on a screen, but we have adapted them to be a critical component of our quantum simulator.”
The initial loading of the atoms into the optical tweezers is random, and the researchers must move the atoms around to arrange them into their target geometries. The researchers use a second set of moving optical tweezers to drag the atoms to their desired locations, eliminating the initial randomness. Lasers give the researchers complete control over the positioning of the atomic qubits and their coherent quantum manipulation.
Other senior authors of the study include Harvard Professors Subir Sachdev and Markus Greiner, who worked on the project along with Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Vladan Vuletić, and scientists from Stanford, the University of California Berkeley, the University of Innsbruck in Austria, the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and QuEra Computing Inc. in Boston.
“Our work is part of a really intense, high-visibility global race to build bigger and better quantum computers,” said Tout Wang, a research associate in physics at Harvard and one of the paper’s authors. “The overall effort [beyond our own] has top academic research institutions involved and major private-sector investment from Google, IBM, Amazon, and many others.”
The researchers are currently working to improve the system by improving laser control over qubits and making the system more programmable. They are also actively exploring how the system can be used for new applications, ranging from probing exotic forms of quantum matter to solving challenging real-world problems that can be naturally encoded on the qubits.
“This work enables a vast number of new scientific directions,” Ebadi said. “We are nowhere near the limits of what can be done with these systems.”

If an incoming photon has too little energy, the cell won’t absorb it. If a photon has too much, the excess is wasted as heat. No matter what, a silicon solar cell can never generate more than one electron from a single photon. Such harsh quantum realities severely limit the conversion efficiency of photovoltaic cells, and scientists have spent decades looking for work-arounds.
Now, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Excitonics have published a compelling case that the key to greater solar efficiency might be an organic dye called pentacene. In today’s issue of Science Daniel Congreve, Jiye Lee, Nicholas Thompson, Marc Baldo and six others show that a photovoltaic cell based on pentacene can generate two electrons from a single photon—more electricity from the same amount of sun. Scientists have suspected for some time that this might work; today’s paper is proof of concept.
The key is a phenomenon called singlet-exciton fission, in which an arriving photon generates two “excitons” (excited states) that can be made to yield two electrons. Previous researchers had accomplished similar tricks using quantum dots (tiny pieces of matter that behave like atoms) and deep-ultraviolet light. “What we showed here,” Baldo says, in addition to using visible light, “is that [this process] works very, very effectively in organic materials.”
Why it works is still not particularly clear, and for now, the pentacene cell works only with an extremely narrow band of visible light. But Baldo says it should be possible to create a pentacene coating for silicon solar cells that boosts the total conversion efficiency from today’s 25 percent to a shade over 30 percent—a significant jump. Developing that technology is the obvious next step. “Can we apply this thing as a coating on silicon?” Baldo says. “If we can do that, it would have a pretty major impact on solar cell technology.”",1948,"['c9i7y1p', 'c9i7a6q', 'c9iadcl', 'c9i9qrq', 'c9i7m29', 'c9icr50', 'c9ietks', 'c9i80iz', 'c9i9ic2', 'c9ij7kv', 'c9imwix', 'c9ins8f', 'c9iapel', 'c9i9f5s', 'c9ifnyy', 'c9i696h', 'c9i95ja']"

A team of scientists at Freie Universität Berlin has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) method for calculating the ground state of the Schrödinger equation in quantum chemistry. The goal of quantum chemistry is to predict chemical and physical properties of molecules based solely on the arrangement of their atoms in space, avoiding the need for resource-intensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments. In principle, this can be achieved by solving the Schrödinger equation, but in practice this is extremely difficult.
Up to now, it has been impossible to find an exact solution for arbitrary molecules that can be efficiently computed. But the team at Freie Universität has developed a deep learning method that can achieve an unprecedented combination of accuracy and computational efficiency. AI has transformed many technological and scientific areas, from computer vision to materials science. “We believe that our approach may significantly impact the future of quantum chemistry,” says Professor Frank Noé, who led the team effort. The results were published in the reputed journal Nature Chemistry.
Central to both quantum chemistry and the Schrödinger equation is the wave function – a mathematical object that completely specifies the behavior of the electrons in a molecule. The wave function is a high-dimensional entity, and it is therefore extremely difficult to capture all the nuances that encode how the individual electrons affect each other. Many methods of quantum chemistry in fact give up on expressing the wave function altogether, instead attempting only to determine the energy of a given molecule. This however requires approximations to be made, limiting the prediction quality of such methods.
Other methods represent the wave function with the use of an immense number of simple mathematical building blocks, but such methods are so complex that they are impossible to put into practice for more than a mere handful of atoms. “Escaping the usual trade-off between accuracy and computational cost is the highest achievement in quantum chemistry,” explains Dr. Jan Hermann of Freie Universität Berlin, who designed the key features of the method in the study. “As yet, the most popular such outlier is the extremely cost-effective density functional theory. We believe that deep “Quantum Monte Carlo,” the approach we are proposing, could be equally, if not more successful. It offers unprecedented accuracy at a still acceptable computational cost.”
The deep neural network designed by Professor Noé’s team is a new way of representing the wave functions of electrons. “Instead of the standard approach of composing the wave function from relatively simple mathematical components, we designed an artificial neural network capable of learning the complex patterns of how electrons are located around the nuclei,” Noé explains. “One peculiar feature of electronic wave functions is their antisymmetry. When two electrons are exchanged, the wave function must change its sign. We had to build this property into the neural network architecture for the approach to work,” adds Hermann. This feature, known as “Pauli’s exclusion principle,” is why the authors called their method “PauliNet.”
Besides the Pauli exclusion principle, electronic wave functions also have other fundamental physical properties, and much of the innovative success of PauliNet is that it integrates these properties into the deep neural network, rather than letting deep learning figure them out by just observing the data. “Building the fundamental physics into the AI is essential for its ability to make meaningful predictions in the field,” says Noé. “This is really where scientists can make a substantial contribution to AI, and exactly what my group is focused on.”
There are still many challenges to overcome before Hermann and Noé’s method is ready for industrial application. “This is still fundamental research,” the authors agree, “but it is a fresh approach to an age-old problem in the molecular and material sciences, and we are excited about the possibilities it opens up.”

Likewise, in quantum physics, particles can feel the influence of magnetic fields that they never come into direct contact with. Now scientists have shown that this eerie quantum effect holds not just for magnetic fields, but for gravity too — and it’s no superstition.
Usually, to feel the influence of a magnetic field, a particle would have to pass through it. But in 1959, physicists Yakir Aharonov and David Bohm predicted that, in a specific scenario, the conventional wisdom would fail. A magnetic field contained within a cylindrical region can affect particles — electrons, in their example — that never enter the cylinder. In this scenario, the electrons don’t have well-defined locations, but are in “superpositions,” quantum states described by the odds of a particle materializing in two different places. Each fractured particle simultaneously takes two different paths around the magnetic cylinder. Despite never touching the electrons, and hence exerting no force on them, the magnetic field shifts the pattern of where particles are found at the end of this journey, as various experiments have confirmed (SN: 3/1/86).
In the new experiment, the same uncanny physics is at play for gravitational fields, physicists report in the Jan. 14 Science. “Every time I look at this experiment, I’m like, ‘It’s amazing that nature is that way,’” says physicist Mark Kasevich of Stanford University.
Kasevich and colleagues launched rubidium atoms inside a 10-meter-tall vacuum chamber, hit them with lasers to put them in quantum superpositions tracing two different paths, and watched how the atoms fell. Notably, the particles weren’t in a gravitational field–free zone. Instead, the experiment was designed so that the researchers could filter out the effects of gravitational forces, laying bare the eerie Aharonov-Bohm influence.

The study not only reveals a famed physics effect in a new context, but also showcases the potential to study subtle effects in gravitational systems. For example, researchers aim to use this type of technique to better measure Newton’s gravitational constant, G, which reveals the strength of gravity, and is currently known less precisely than other fundamental constants of nature (SN: 8/29/18).
A phenomenon called interference is key to this experiment. In quantum physics, atoms and other particles behave like waves that can add and subtract, just as two swells merging in the ocean make a larger wave. At the end of the atoms’ flight, the scientists recombined the atoms’ two paths so their waves would interfere, then measured where the atoms arrived. The arrival locations are highly sensitive to tweaks that alter where the peaks and troughs of the waves land, known as phase shifts.
At the top of the vacuum chamber, the researchers placed a hunk of tungsten with a mass of 1.25 kilograms. To isolate the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the scientists performed the same experiment with and without this mass, and for two different sets of launched atoms, one which flew close to the mass, and the other lower. Each of those two sets of atoms were split into superpositions, with one path traveling closer to the mass than the other, separated by about 25 centimeters. Other sets of atoms, with superpositions split across smaller distances, rounded out the crew. Comparing how the various sets of atoms interfered, both with and without the tungsten mass, teased out a phase shift that was not due to the gravitational force. Instead, that tweak was from time dilation, a feature of Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity, which causes time to pass more slowly close to a massive object.
The two theories that underlie this experiment, general relativity and quantum mechanics, don’t work well together. Scientists don’t know how to combine them to describe reality. So, for physicists, says Guglielmo Tino of the University of Florence, who was not involved with the new study, “probing gravity with a quantum sensor, I think it’s really one of … the most important challenges at the moment.”",4350,"['hsr19yw', 'hsq6oex', 'hsqkm8s', 'hsqd7ae', 'hsqdt3h', 'hsr301o', 'hsqzv9t', 'hsqoaaq', 'hsrl5io']"

Physicists have built a quantum scale heat pump made from particles of light. This device brings scientists closer to the quantum limit of measuring radio frequency signals, which is useful in the hunt for dark matter.
If you bring together two objects of different temperatures, such as putting a warm bottle of white wine into a cold chill pack, heat usually flows in one direction, from hot (the wine) to cold (the chill pack). And if you wait long enough, the two will both reach the same temperature. This is a process known in physics as reaching equilibrium: a balance between the heat flow one way and the other.
If you are willing to do some work, you can break this balance and cause heat to flow in the “wrong” way. This is the principle used in your refrigerator to keep your food cold, as well as in efficient heat pumps that can steal heat from the cold air outside to warm your house. In their publication, Gary Steele and his colleagues demonstrate a quantum analog of a heat pump, causing the elementary quantum particles of light, known as photons, to move “against the flow” from a hot object to a cold one.
The study was conducted by physicists from TU Delft, ETH Zürich, and the University of Tübingen. Their work will be published today (August 26, 2022) as an open-access article in the journal Science Advances.
Dark matter signals
Although the physicists had already used their device as a cold bath for hot radio-frequency photons in a previous study, they have now managed to simultaneously turn it into an amplifier. With the built-in amplifier, the device is more sensitive to radio-frequency signals. This is just like what happens with amplified microwave signals coming out of superconducting quantum processors. “It’s very exciting, because we can get closer to the quantum limit of measuring the radio frequency signals, frequencies that are hard to measure otherwise. This new measuring tool might have lots of applications, one of them being to look for dark matter,” Steele says.
A quantum heat pump
The device, known as a photon pressure circuit, is constructed from superconducting inductors and capacitors on a silicon chip cooled to only a few millidegrees above absolute zero temperature. While this sounds very cold, for some of the photons in the circuit, this temperature is very hot, and they are excited with thermal energy. Using photon pressure, the scientists can couple these excited photons to higher frequency cold photons, which in previous experiments allowed them to cool the hot photons into their quantum ground state.
In this new work, the physicists add a new twist: by sending an extra signal into the cold circuit, they are able to create a motor that amplifies the cold photons and heats them up. At the same time, the extra signal “pumps” the photons preferentially in one direction between the two circuits. By pushing photons harder in one direction than the other, the researchers are able to cool the photons in one part of the circuit to a temperature that is colder than the other part, creating a quantum version of the heat pump for photons in a superconducting circuit.

IQM raises €128m to find out Some estimates suggest quantum computing could help save 7 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions a year by 2035. By Freya Pratty 22 July 2022 IQM, the Finnish quantum computing hardware provider, has raised a €128m round led by climate tech investor World Fund — Europe’s largest quantum round ever. The fundraising comes as Europe’s quantum efforts are ramping up — this month saw the launch of the continent’s first dedicated quantum VC fund while governments are also pledging increased support for the industry. The new funding will go towards IQM’s work on developing quantum computers to produce solutions to the climate crisis. What is IQM? Launched in 2018, IQM is already the best-funded of Europe’s quantum computing startups. It’s now raised €178.5m from investors, and €200m if you include public grants and loans. The company is one of the few European startups focused on quantum computer hardware — a field where it is up against big US companies like IBM and Google. It plans on selling its computers to research labs, data centres and companies. How can quantum computing help the climate crisis? Computers, both quantum and conventional, are machines which you programme a problem into and get an answer back. The problem with conventional computers is that there are some problems that are so complex that they’d be calculating the answer for thousands of years — or potentially forever. “The promise of quantum computers is that for some of those problems, they can create a shortcut, which brings the timescale from 1000s of years, to hours, minutes or seconds,” explains IQM’s cofounder and CEO Jan Goetz. If we’re going to tackle the climate crisis, there are complex problems we need to overcome — and quantum computing companies believe they can help. “We’re not saying that quantum computing can solve the climate crisis, but I think quantum computers can have some impact in a positive way and can help reduce CO2 emissions to a certain extent,” Goetz says. Better batteries, more efficient solar and a replacement for concrete One of the key applications where IQM thinks quantum could have an impact is on developing more efficient batteries to better replace the combustion engine. Quantum computers can more accurately simulate the way chemical processes work at an atomic level — and that precision can help develop more efficient batteries. The computers could also simulate the processes within a solar power cell, to work out how to increase the percentage of the light spectrum that gets turned into electric energy. The IQM team Goetz says the computers could also work on alternatives to materials like concrete (which produces a significant fraction of global emissions), as well as working on energy grid optimisation and making the traffic flow of cities more efficient to lower CO2 emissions. Other companies are also working on climate applications. French quantum startup Pasqal just made a deal with chemical company BASF, to work on better weather modelling technology. How big can the impact be? Quantum computing is still in its early stages. Eventually, companies intend for them to replace large computing centres, which work for days on a problem. At present, conventional computing centres can run faster than quantum, but companies like IQM say the tech should surpass the centres in speed soon. McKinsey estimates that quantum computing could help develop technologies with the potential to abate 7 gigatonnes of CO2 a year by 2035. Guessing the emissions savings of solutions that hasn’t yet been thought up is a speculative game, and Goetz is slightly more modest in his predictions of the impact. For the use cases IQM is already working on, there could be 100 megatonnes of CO2 emissions saved by 2040. “We might see the first applications before 2030,” he says, “but there’s some uncertainty on the timescales, so we wanted to be on the safe side.” Freya Pratty is a reporter at Sifted.

In theory such a machine could create mathematical models too complex for standard computers, vastly extending the range and accuracy of weather forecasts and financial market predictions, among other things. They could simulate physical processes such as photosynthesis, opening new frontiers in green energy. Quantum computing could also jolt artificial intelligence to a vastly higher level of sophistication: If IBM’s Watson can already win at Jeopardy! and make some medical diagnoses, imagine what an enormously smarter version could do.
But to realize those visions, scientists first have to figure out how to actually build a quantum computer that can perform more than the simplest operations. They are now getting closer than ever, with IBM in November 2017 announcing its most complex quantum system so far and Google saying it is on track to unveil a processor with so-called “quantum supremacy”—capabilities no conventional computer can match.
Small systems exist, but the next steps in the race to make them bigger will have to determine whether quantum computers can deliver on their potential. Scientists and industry players have focused largely on one of two approaches. One cools loops of wire to near –273.15 degrees Celsius, or absolute zero, turning them into superconductors where current flows with virtually no resistance. The other relies on trapped ions—charged atoms of the rare earth element ytterbium held in place in a vacuum chamber by laser beams and manipulated by other lasers. The oscillating charges (in both the wires and the trapped ions) function as quantum bits, or “qubits,” which can be harnessed to carry out the computer’s operations.
Quantum Leaps
The trick to either approach is figuring out how to get from already demonstrated systems—containing just a few qubits—to ones that can handle the hundreds or thousands, even millions, required for the kind of heavy lifting that quantum technology seems to promise. In 2016 IBM made a five-qubit quantum processor available to developers, researchers and programmers for experimentation via its cloud portal. The company has made significant progress since then, revealing that it has upgraded its cloud-based quantum computer to a 20-qubit processor—and developed in-house a 50-qubit processor prototype that could be the basis for commercial systems. Both are based on the wire-loop superconducting circuits, as is Google’s 72-qubit processor, which the company announced at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society in March 2018. Julian Kelly, an engineer in Google’s Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, wrote in a blog post that the company is “cautiously optimistic” it can achieve quantum supremacy with its processor.
Those numbers may not seem impressive. But a qubit is much more powerful than the kind of bit that serves as the smallest unit of data in a conventional computer. Those bits are based on the flow of electric current and make up the digital language in which all computing functions: “Off” means 0 and “on” means 1, and those two states encode all of the computer’s operations. Qubits, however, are not based on “yes/no” electrical switches—but rather on a particle’s quantum properties, such as the direction in which an electron spins. And in the quantum world a particle can simultaneously exist in a variety of states more complex than simply on/off—a phenomenon known as superposition. “You can have heads, you can have tails, but you can also have any weighted superposition. You can have 70-30 heads-tails,” says Christopher Monroe, a physicist at the University of Maryland, College Park, and founder of IonQ, a start-up working on building a quantum computer with trapped ions. He is currently working on a 32-qubit prototype based on that approach.
The more-than-binary ability to occupy multiple states at once allows qubits to perform many calculations simultaneously, vastly magnifying their computing power. That power grows exponentially with the number of qubits. So at somewhere around 49 or 50 qubits, quantum computers reach the equivalent of about 10 quadrillion bits and become capable of calculations no classical computer could ever match, says John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology. “Whether they will be doing useful things is a different question,” he says. Although IBM has reached the 50-qubit mark and Google has passed it, neither has yet demonstrated that they have surpassed the abilities of classical computers.
Both superconducting circuits and trapped ions have a good shot at hitting that fiftyish-qubit threshold, says Jerry Chow, manager of experimental quantum computing at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. Conventional thinking would suggest that more qubits means more power—but Chow notes that “it’s not just about the number of qubits.” He is more focused on the number and quality of calculations the machine can perform, a metric he calls “quantum volume.” That includes additional factors such as how fast the qubits can perform the calculations and how well they avoid or correct for errors that can creep in. Some of those factors can work against one another; adding more qubits, for instance, can increase the rate of errors as information passes down the line from one qubit to another. Quantum supremacy is just one possible measure of a quantum computer’s capabilities, he says, and the community needs to come up with various tests before it can state that a system has really surpassed classical machines. “As a community we should all be focusing—no matter whether we’re working on superconducting qubits or trapped ions or whatever—on pushing this quantum volume higher and higher so we can really make more and more powerful quantum processors and do things that we never thought of,” Chow says.
Better, not Bigger
Monroe compared his five-qubit trapped ion system with IBM’s five-qubit processor by running the same simple algorithms on both and found the performance comparable. The biggest difference, he says, is that the trapped ions are all connected to one another via electromagnetic forces: Wiggle one ion in a string of 30 and every other ion reacts, making it easy to quickly and accurately pass information among them. In the wire-loop superconductor circuit only some qubits are connected, which makes passing information a slower process that can introduce errors.
One advantage of superconducting circuits is that they are easy to build using the same processes that make computer chips. They perform a computer’s basic logic gate operations—that is, adding, subtracting or otherwise manipulating the bits—in billionths of a second. On the other hand, qubits in this type of system hold their quantum state for only milliseconds—thousandths of a second—so any operation must be completed in that time.
Trapped ions, in contrast, retain their quantum states for many seconds—sometimes even minutes or hours. But the logic gates in such a system run about 1,000 times slower than in superconductor-based quantum computing. That speed reduction probably does not matter in simple operations with just a few qubits, Monroe says. But it could become a problem for getting an answer in a reasonable amount of time as the number of qubits increases. For superconducting qubits, rising numbers may mean a struggle to connect them together.
And increasing the number of qubits, no matter what technology they are used with, makes it harder to connect and manipulate them—because that must be done while keeping them isolated from the rest of the world so they will maintain their quantum states. The more atoms or electrons are grouped together in large numbers, the more the rules of classical physics take over—and the less significant the quantum properties of the individual atoms become to how the whole system behaves. “When you make a quantum system big, it becomes less quantum,” Monroe says.
Chow thinks quantum computers will become powerful enough to do at least something beyond the capability of classical computers—possibly a simulation in quantum chemistry—within about five years. Monroe says it is reasonable to expect systems containing a few thousand qubits in a decade or so. To some extent, Monroe says, researchers will not know what they will be able to do with such systems until they figure out how to build them.
Preskill, who is 65, says he thinks he will live long enough to see quantum computers have an impact on society in the way the Internet and smartphones have—although he cannot predict exactly what that effect will be. “These quantum systems kind of speak a language that digital systems don’t speak,” he says. “We know from history that we just don’t have the imagination to anticipate where new information technologies can carry us.”",9028,"['djtf8ml', 'djtgwot', 'djt8miq', 'djtbo2g', 'djsywos']"

FINALLY. No more lag in my starcraft games.,,2010-05-19,Casey Johnston,Quantum teleportation achieved over ten miles of free space,"Quantum teleportation has achieved a new milestone or, should we say, a new ten-milestone: scientists have recently had success teleporting information between photons over a free space distance of nearly ten miles, an unprecedented length. The researchers who have accomplished this feat note that this brings us closer to communicating information without needing a traditional signal, and that the ten miles they have reached could span the distance between the surface of the earth and space.
As we've explained before, ""quantum teleportation"" is quite different from how many people imagine teleportation to work. Rather than picking one thing up and placing it somewhere else, quantum teleportation involves entangling two things, like photons or ions, so their states are dependent on one another and each can be affected by the measurement of the other's state.
When one of the items is sent a distance away, entanglement ensures that changing the state of one causes the other to change as well, allowing the teleportation of quantum information, if not matter. However, the distance particles can be from each other has been limited so far to a number of meters.
Teleportation over distances of a few hundred meters has previously only been accomplished with the photons traveling in fiber channels to help preserve their state. In this particular experiment, researchers maximally entangled two photons using both spatial and polarization modes and sent the one with higher energy through a ten-mile-long free space channel. They found that the distant photon was still able to respond to changes in state of the photon they held onto even at this unprecedented distance.
However, the long-distance teleportation of a photon is only a small step towards developing applications for the procedure. While photons are good at transmitting information, they are not as good as ions at allowing manipulation, an advancement we'd need for encryption. Researchers were also able to maintain the fidelity of the long-distance teleportation at 89 percent— decent enough for information, but still dangerous for the whole-body human teleportation that we're all looking forward to.",2182,"['c0qbpqr', 'c0qbts4', 'c0qbluy', 'c0qbqne', 'c0qbuio', 'c0qbk0g', 'c0qbzof', 'c0qbo34', 'c0qbuy1', 'c0qbxsj', 'c0qbr7a', 'c0qbltg', 'c0qbpmz', 'c0qbvlu', 'c0qbnox', 'c0qbjft', 'c0qc5x2', 'c0qc9og', 'c0qcycr', 'c0qbtb9', 'c0qbzia', 'c0qc0tg', 'c0qccuo', 'c0qcena', 'c0qcn1s', 'c0qdd5z', 'c0qdhja', 'c0qdp76', 'c0qerna', 'c0qj3nc', 'c0qbkii', 'c0qc6tl', 'c0qcfcm', 'c0qbz06', 'c0qbzht', 'c0qc8sh', 'c0qcbto', 'c0qbyj2', 'c0qbo05', 'c0qbpqr', 'c0qbts4', 'c0qbluy', 'c0qbqne', 'c0qbuio', 'c0qbk0g', 'c0qbzof', 'c0qbo34', 'c0qbuy1', 'c0qbxsj', 'c0qbr7a', 'c0qbltg', 'c0qbpmz', 'c0qbvlu', 'c0qbnox', 'c0qbjft', 'c0qc5x2', 'c0qc9og', 'c0qcycr', 'c0qbtb9', 'c0qbzia', 'c0qc0tg', 'c0qccuo', 'c0qcena', 'c0qcn1s', 'c0qdd5z', 'c0qdhja', 'c0qdp76', 'c0qerna', 'c0qj3nc', 'c0qbkii', 'c0qc6tl', 'c0qcfcm', 'c0qbz06', 'c0qbzht', 'c0qc8sh', 'c0qcbto', 'c0qbyj2', 'c0qbo05']"

A new study in Nature says no. A cleverly-designed quantum device developed by Xanadu, a company based in Toronto, Canada, obliterated conventional computers on a benchmark task that would otherwise take over 9,000 years.
For the quantum chip Borealis, answers came within 36 microseconds.
Xanadu’s accomplishment is the latest to demonstrate the power of quantum computing over conventional computers—a seemingly simple idea dubbed quantum advantage.
Theoretically, the concept makes sense. Unlike conventional computers, which calculate in sequence using binary bits—0 or 1—quantum devices tap into the weirdness of the quantum world, where 0 and 1 can both exist at the same time with differing probabilities. The data is processed in qubits, a noncommittal unit that simultaneously performs multiple calculations thanks to its unique physics.
Translation? A quantum computer is like a hyper-efficient multitasker, whereas conventional computers are far more linear. When given the same problem, a quantum computer should be able to trounce any supercomputer in any problem in terms of speed and efficiency. The idea, dubbed “quantum supremacy,” has been the driving force to push for a new generation of computers completely alien to anything previously made.
The problem? Proving quantum supremacy is extremely difficult. As quantum devices increasingly leave the lab to solve more real-world problems, scientists are embracing an intermediate benchmark: quantum advantage, which is the idea that a quantum computer can beat a conventional one at just one task—any task.
Back in 2019, Google broke the internet showcasing the first example of a quantum computer, Sycamore, solving a computational problem in just 200 seconds with 54 qubits—compared to a conventional supercomputer’s estimate of 10,000 years. A Chinese team soon followed with a second fascinating showcase of quantum computational advantage, with the machine spitting out answers that would take a supercomputer over two billion years.
Yet a crucial question remains: are any of these quantum devices even close to being ready for practical use?
A Drastic Redesign
It’s easy to forget that computers rely on physics. Our current system, for example, taps into electrons and cleverly-designed chips to perform their functions. Quantum computers are similar, but they rely on alternative particle physics. Initial generations of quantum machines looked like delicate, shimmering chandeliers. While absolutely gorgeous, compared to a compact smartphone chip, they’re also completely impractical. The hardware often requires tightly-controlled climates—for example, near absolute zero temperature—to reduce interference and boost the computer’s efficacy.
The core concept of quantum computing is the same: qubits processing data in superposition, a quantum physics quirk that allows them to encode 0s, 1s, or both at the same time. The hardware that supports the idea vastly differs.
Google’s Sycamore, for example, uses superconducting metal loops—a setup popular with other tech giants including IBM, which introduced Eagle, a powerful 127-qubit quantum chip in 2021 that’s about the size of a quarter. Other iterations from companies such as Honeywell and IonQ took a different approach, tapping into ions—atoms with one or more electrons removed—as their main source for quantum computing.
Another idea relies on photons, or particles of light. It’s already been proven useful: the Chinese demonstration of quantum advantage, for example, used a photonic device. But the idea’s also been shunned as a mere stepping stone towards quantum computing rather than a practical solution, largely because of difficulties in engineering and setup.
A Photonic Revolution
Xanadu’s team proved naysayers wrong. The new chip, Borealis, is marginally similar to the one in the Chinese study in that it uses photons—rather than superconducting materials or ions—for computation.
But it has a huge advantage: it’s programmable. “Previous experiments typically relied on static networks, in which each component is fixed once fabricated,” explained Dr. Daniel Jost Brod at the Federal Fluminense University at Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, who was not involved in the study. The earlier quantum advantage demonstration in the Chinese study used a static chip. With Borealis, however, the optical elements “can all be readily programmed,” making it less of a single-use device and more of an actual computer potentially capable of solving multiple problems. (The quantum playground is available on the cloud for anyone to experiment and explore once you sign up.)
The chip’s flexibility comes from an ingenious design update, an “innovative scheme [that] offers impressive control and potential for scaling,” said Brod.
The team zeroed in on a problem called Gaussian boson sampling, a benchmark for evaluating quantum computing prowess. The test, while extraordinarily difficult computationally, doesn’t have much impact on real-world problems. However, like chess or Go for measuring AI performance, it acts as an unbiased judge to examine quantum computing performance. It’s a “gold standard” of sorts: “Gaussian boson sampling is a scheme designed to demonstrate the advantages of quantum devices over classical computers,” explained Brod.
The setup is like a carnival funhouse mirror tent in a horror movie. Special states of light (and photons)—amusingly called “squeezed states”—are tunneled onto the chip embedded with a network of beam splitters. Each beam splitter acts like a semi-reflective mirror: depending on how the light hits, it splits into multiple daughters, with some reflecting back and others passing through. At the end of the contraption is an array of photon detectors. The more beam splitters, the more difficult it is to calculate how any individual photon will end up at any given detector.
As another visualization: picture a bean machine, a peg-studded board encased in glass. To play, you drop a puck into the pegs at the top. As the puck falls, it randomly hits different pegs, eventually landing in a numbered slot.
Gaussian boson sampling replaces the pucks with photons, with the goal of detecting which photon lands in which detector slot. Due to quantum properties, the possible resulting distributions grow exponentially, rapidly outpacing any supercomputer powers. It’s an excellent benchmark, explained Brod, largely because we understand the underlying physics, and the setup suggests that even a few hundred photons can challenge supercomputers.
Taking up the challenge, the new study reimagined a photonic quantum device with an admirable 216 qubits. Contradicting classic designs, the device calculated photons in bins of arrival time rather than the previous standard of direction. The trick was to introduce loops of optical fibers to delay photons so they can interfere at specific spots important for quantum computation.
These tweaks led to a vastly slimmed-down device. The usual large network of beam splitters—normally needed for photon communications—can be reduced to just three to accommodate all the necessary delays for photons to interact and compute the task. The loop designs, along with other components, are also “readily programmable” in that a beam splitter can be fine-tuned in real time—like editing computer code, but at the hardware level.
The team also aced a standard sanity check, certifying that the output data was correct.
For now, studies that reliably show quantum supremacy remain rare. Conventional computers have a half century head start. As algorithms keep evolving on conventional computers—especially those that tap into powerful AI-focused chips or neuromorphic computing designs—they may even readily outperform quantum devices, leaving them struggling to catch up.
But that’s the fun of the chase. “Quantum advantage is not a well-defined threshold, based on a single figure of merit. And as experiments develop, so too will techniques to simulate them —we can expect record-setting quantum devices and classical algorithms in the near future to take turns in challenging each other for the top spot,” said Brod.
“It might not be the end of the story,” he continued. But the new study “is a leap forward for quantum physics in this race.”

Now, a team of researchers has put together a mathematical model showing aliens could potentially be communicating across space – via quantum physics.
Efforts are well underway to make quantum communications a reality here on Earth. The idea is that quantum mechanics provide certain properties that would make information transfer inherently faster and more secure than regular systems… if we can get it to work.
One of the major hurdles to overcome before quantum networks can be established is that they're very fragile and susceptible to interference. According to this latest study, such networks could fly across space without breaking up.
""Quantum states you generally think of as very delicate, and if there's any kind of external interaction, you kind of destroy that state,"" lead author of the research, theoretical physicist Arjun Berera from the University of Edinburgh in the UK, told Science News.
Berera and his colleague Jaime Calderón-Figueroa, a fellow theoretical physicist at the University of Edinburgh, ran calculations on the movement of X-rays across the emptiness of space to check for potential decoherence (the breaking up of the quantum state).
If photons – particles of light – were used as the quantum particles, the researchers determined, they could be beamed across hundreds of thousands of light-years at least, a greater stretch of distance than the entire Milky Way galaxy.
That's partly because the average density of matter in space is much less than it is on Earth, and this 'cleaner' environment means less chance of interference. Even gravitational pulls wouldn't be enough to knock a quantum communication network off course.
""It is plausible that quantum communication mediated by photons could be established across interstellar distances, in particular for photons in the X-ray region below the electron mass,"" write the researchers in their published paper.
That alien life forms might be using quantum networks to speak to each other or to try and get in touch with us is, of course, pure speculation – but at the same time it gives astronomers another potential sign of life they can monitor for.
The ""considerable information transfer"" possible with a quantum signal would make it attractive to any extraterrestrial intelligence out there in the cosmos, the researchers say, though it may require a fully functioning quantum computer in order to decode it.
And even quantum communication isn't magic: Information still can't travel faster than the speed of light, so transmissions may take several years to reach their destinations.
Based on these findings, we can now add quantum communication as well as classical communication to the possible ways aliens might be chatting with each other – or perhaps might be trying to make themselves known to us.
""In principle, it should be possible to detect a quantum signal coming from an astrophysical body or even an intelligent signal from an extraterrestrial civilization,"" write the researchers.

The Condor processor is just one quantum-computing advance slated for 2023
IBM’s Condor, the world’s first universal quantum computer with more than 1,000 qubits, is set to debut in 2023. The year is also expected to see IBM launch Heron, the first of a new flock of modular quantum processors that the company says may help it produce quantum computers with more than 4,000 qubits by 2025.
This article is part of our special report Top Tech 2023.
While quantum computers can, in theory, quickly find answers to problems that classical computers would take eons to solve, today’s quantum hardware is still short on qubits, limiting its usefulness. Entanglement and other quantum states necessary for quantum computation are infamously fragile, being susceptible to heat and other disturbances, which makes scaling up the number of qubits a huge technical challenge.
Nevertheless, IBM has steadily increased its qubit numbers. In 2016, it put the first quantum computer in the cloud anyone to experiment with—a device with 5 qubits, each a superconducting circuit cooled to near absolute zero. In 2019, the company created the 27-qubit Falcon; in 2020, the 65-qubit Hummingbird; in 2021, the 127-qubit Eagle, the first quantum processor with more than 100 qubits; and in 2022, the 433-qubit Osprey.

Other quantum computers have more qubits than does IBM’s 1,121-qubit Condor processor—for instance, D-Wave Systems unveiled a 5,000-qubit system in 2020. But D-Wave’s computers are specialized machines for solving optimization problems, whereas Condor will be the world’s largest general-purpose quantum processor.
“A thousand qubits really pushes the envelope in terms of what we can really integrate,” says Jerry Chow, IBM’s director of quantum infrastructure. By separating the wires and other components needed for readout and control onto their own layers, a strategy that began with Eagle, the researchers say they can better protect qubits from disruption and incorporate larger numbers of them. “As we scale upwards, we’re learning design rules like ‘This can go over this; this can’t go over this; this space can be used for this task,’” Chow says.
Other quantum computers with more qubits exist, but Condor will be the world’s largest general-purpose quantum processor.
With only 133 qubits, Heron, the other quantum processor IBM plans for 2023, may seem modest compared with Condor. But IBM says its upgraded architecture and modular design herald a new strategy for developing powerful quantum computers. Whereas Condor uses a fixed-coupling architecture to connect its qubits, Heron will use a tunable-coupling architecture, which adds Josephson junctions between the superconducting loops that carry the qubits. This strategy reduces crosstalk between qubits, boosting processing speed and reducing errors. (Google is already using such an architecture with its 53-qubit Sycamore processor.)
In addition, Heron processors are designed for real-time classical communication with one another. The classical nature of these links means their qubits cannot entangle across Heron chips for the kind of boosts in computing power for which quantum processors are known. Still, these classical links enable “ circuit knitting” techniques in which quantum computers can get assistance from classical computers.
For example, using a technique known as “ entanglement forging,” IBM researchers found they could simulate quantum systems such as molecules using only half as many qubits as is typically needed. This approach divides a quantum system into two halves, models each half separately on a quantum computer, and then uses classical computing to calculate the entanglement between both halves and knit the models together.
IBM Quantum State of the Union 2022
While these classical links between processors are helpful, IBM intends eventually to replace them. In 2024, the company aims to launch Crossbill, a 408-qubit processor made from three microchips coupled together by short-range quantum communication links, and Flamingo, a 462-qubit module it plans on uniting by roughly 1-meter-long quantum communication links into a 1,386-qubit system. If these experiments in connectivity succeed, IBM aims to unveil its 1,386-qubit Kookaburra module in 2025, with short- and long-range quantum communication links combining three such modules into a 4,158-qubit system.
IBM’s methodical strategy of “aiming at step-by-step improvements is very reasonable, and it will likely lead to success over the long term,” says Franco Nori, chief scientist at the Theoretical Quantum Physics Laboratory at the Riken research institute in Japan.
IBM’s quantum leaps in software
In 2023, IBM also plans to improve its core software to help developers use quantum and classical computing in unison over the cloud. “We’re laying the groundwork for what a quantum-centric supercomputer looks like,” Chow says. “We don’t see quantum processors as fully integrated but as loosely aggregated.” This kind of framework will grant the flexibility needed to accommodate the constant upgrades that quantum hardware and software will likely experience, he explains.
In 2023, IBM plans to begin prototyping quantum software applications. By 2025, the company expects to introduce such applications in machine learning, optimization problems, the natural sciences, and beyond.
Researchers hope ultimately to use quantum error correction to compensate for the mistakes quantum processors are prone to make. These schemes spread quantum data across redundant qubits, requiring multiple physical qubits for each single useful logical qubit. Instead, IBM plans to incorporate error-mitigation schemes into its platform starting in 2024, to prevent these mistakes in the first place. But even if wrangling errors ends up demanding many more qubits, IBM should be in a good position with the likes of its 1,121-qubit Condor.

Here’s a quantum of solace. The first quantum transmission to go via space paves the way for ultra-secure communications satellites.
Secret encryption keys transmitted via quantum links provide the ultimate way to communicate securely. That’s because any attempt to intercept the key will be revealed thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics, which say that interception will introduce changes that give away eavesdroppers.
The technology is already available for fibre-optic cables, but a truly global network would need satellites to beam quantum data between distant locations. To test how these might work, Paolo Villoresi at the University of Padua in Italy and his colleagues turned to satellites covered in ultra-reflective mirrors. These are normally used to bounce laser beams back to Earth. The time they take to return shows up any shifts in gravity.

Record bounce
In 2007, the team sent a beam of light to space using the Matera Laser Ranging Observatory (MLRO) in Italy and detected single photons bounced off Japan’s Ajisai satellite. For the latest experiment, they prepared photons in four different quantum states – the minimum required to generate an encryption key – and sent them to space using the MLRO. They were able to receive quantum bits of information, or qubits, bounced back from five satellites up to 2600 kilometres above. That smashes the previous record for sending quantum information – 144 kilometres, between two locations on Earth.
To ensure they didn’t count background photons that were not part of the signal, the team timed the laser pulses exactly, rejecting any light that returned outside a narrow time window. The observatory acted as the transmitter and receiver, so the team decided not to send an encrypted message. Still, the team thinks the photons would have been able to encrypt about one bit of data a second.
The team has a way to go before quantum satellites are up to speed. Light travells easily through fibre optic cables compared to turbulent air, so ground-based commercial versions of the technology can encrypt at much faster rates of at least 1 megabit a second.
Villoresi compares the performance to Sputnik, the first-ever satellite, launched in 1957. “Comments at the time were, ‘How nice, the satellite can send a few beeps, it’s totally useless’,” he says. “We are more or less the same level.” But even a very limited data channel could be used to send secure commands to a spacecraft, he says.
Closer to quantum comms
Rupert Ursin at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in Vienna, Austria, points out that Villoresi’s team sent the qubits in four bursts, each tens of seconds apart. That means they did not detect all four quantum states at once, which would be necessary for a true quantum satellite.
And Jian-Wei Pan at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei notes that a lot of photons are lost in transmission, so he is not sure the signal would be strong enough to transmit a full quantum key. But Pan and Ursin both say the work shows the technology is getting close.
China has announced plans to launch a true quantum communications satellite in 2016, and other nations’ space agencies are investigating the possibility. “Everything is ready, and if we had enough money we could fly,” says Ursin. “The risk that we fail in space is reduced thanks to these kinds of experiments.”

Not so if you work at Google or NASA. In a sign the technology is creeping closer to practical use, Google, NASA, and the non-profit Universities Space Research Association (USRA) recently announced formation of the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab and seeded it with a brand new 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum computer.
Quantum computers promise to be orders of magnitude faster than classical computers and far better at the “optimization problems” associated with machine learning—improving not only Google search but perhaps ushering in the kind of “creative problem solving” humans associate with intelligence.
Each D-Wave quantum computer is housed in a 10’ featureless black cabinet. Inside the box, an apparatus hangs from the ceiling like a high-tech stalactite. A niobium chip resides in the tip and is cooled to a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero, at which point it becomes a superconductor. But apart from being colder than deep space, the way the computer itself functions differs from the classical model.
Classical computers solve problems by systematically switching transistors “on” (1) and “off” (0). Quantum computers use qubits to represent both classical states (0 and 1) plus an in between state enabled by a weird quantum property physicists call “superposition.” In superposition, the qubit is both 0 and 1 at the same time, allowing the system to consider multiple problems simultaneously.
It’s this simultaneity that makes quantum computers such efficient solvers of optimization problems.
In a blog post, Google tells us to consider how a current computer might find the lowest point in a series of hills and valleys. A classical algorithm would start at a random point and see if it can walk lower, repeating the process until it can no longer descend. Unless it got lucky with its starting point, there’s a good chance the algorithm gets stuck in a local minimum, not the absolute minimum—it’s a solution, but not the optimal solution.
A quantum computer, meanwhile, would be able to consider multiple valleys simultaneously. It’s like “tunneling” through adjacent hills to see whether the valley next door is lower than the valley you’re in currently, thus raising the likelihood you find the lowest point.
Google is the second firm to purchase a D-Wave computer. The 14-year-old firm sold a 128-qubit D-Wave One to Lockheed Martin in 2011. Lockheed went on to establish the USC Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center later that year. The Lockheed machine has since been upgraded to the 512-qubit D-Wave Two, and according to the New York Times, the NASA Ames machine may be upgraded to a 2,048 qubit chip in the next year or two.
D-Wave’s machines have kicked up a little controversy over the years. The firm’s early claims tended to oustrip their machine’s proven capabilities, and some experts questioned whether the machines were true quantum computers.
However, in recent years, D-Wave has begun to win over the critics. Just last year, the firm called in a third party expert, Catherine McGeoch of Amherst University, to measure just how fast their machine was solving particular problems.
In some optimization problems, the D-Wave handily beat the test PC—finding solutions up to 3,600 times faster. But unless the problem is specially tailored to fit the quantum computer, it has to be translated. The D-Wave performed on par with the classical computer when working on problems in need of translation.
Whether the computer conforms to the favored definition of quantum computing may be largely academic. Google and its partners performed rigorous tests of the hardware before cutting D-Wave a check.
D-Wave’s director of business, Colin Williams told the New York Times, “The tougher, more complex [problems] had better performance. For most problems, it was 11,000 times faster, but in the more difficult 50 percent, it was 33,000 times faster. In the top 25 percent, it was 50,000 times faster.”
According to their blog, Google has already developed some quantum computing algorithms. Because the D-Wave is so good at specific problems, they think some classical/quantum combination may prove ideal. Perhaps future quantum chips will provide the kind of power boost specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) have recently provided supercomputers. Or maybe the “neocortex” of future AIs will be comprised of a quantum chip, whereas the rest will remain classically driven.
There’s yet much work to be done before these machines find practical applications, but Google thinks “quantum machine learning may provide the most creative problem-solving process under the known laws of physics.”

No, they haven't beamed anyone up to a spaceship. Rather, they sent a packet of information from Tibet to a satellite in orbit, up to 870 miles (1,400 kilometers) above the Earth's surface.
More specifically, the scientists beamed the quantum state of a photon (information about how it is polarized) into orbit.
Not only did the team set a record for quantum teleportation distance, they also showed that one can build a practical system for long-distance quantum communications. Such a communication system would be impossible to eavesdrop on without alerting the users, which would make online communications much more secure.
Experiments like this have been done before, but Howard Wiseman, director of the Center for Quantum Dynamics at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, told Live Science in an email that this one expands the possibilities for the technology.

""This is much more difficult, because it is to a rapidly moving target, and you have your quantum detectors way out in space where they have to work without anyone fiddling with them,"" he said. ""It is a big step towards global-scale quantum communication.""
Spooky pairs
The experiment takes advantage of one of several phenomena that describes quantum mechanics: entanglement, or ""spooky action at a distance,"" as Albert Einstein called it. When two particles are entangled, they remain connected so that an action performed on one affects the other as well, no matter how far apart the two are. In the same vein, when one measures the state of one particle in the entangled duo, you'd automatically know the state of the second. Physicists call the states ""correlated,"" because if one particle — a photon, for example — is in an ""up"" state, its entangled partner will be in a ""down"" state — a kind of mirror image. (Strictly speaking, there are four possible combinations for the two particles to be in).
The weird part is that once the state of the first particle is measured, the second one somehow ""knows"" what state it should be in. The information seems to travel instantaneously, without a speed-of-light limit. [8 Ways You Can See Einstein's Theory of Relativity in Real Life]
Teleporting information
In June, the same researchers reported another feat in quantum teleportation: They sent entangled photons from the Micius satellite to two ground stations over distances between 994 miles and 1,490 miles (1,600 and 2,400 km), depending on the location of the satellite in its orbit. While this experiment showed that entanglement can happen over long distances, the new experiment uses that entanglement to transmit a photon's quantum state to a distant location.
In their latest experiment, the Chinese team, led by Ji-Gang Ren at the University of Science and Technology in Shanghai, fired a laser from a ground station in Tibet to a satellite in orbit. That laser beam carried a photon entangled with another photon on the ground. They then entangled the photon on the ground with a third photon, and measured their quantum states. But the scientists didn't actually reveal the states themselves. They just asked whether their states (in this case, their vertical or horizontal polarizations) were the same or different. There are four possible combinations: vertical-vertical, vertical-horizontal, horizontal-vertical and horizontal-horizontal. Since the states of the particles on the ground were correlated with the one on the satellite, an observer looking at the satellite's photon, meanwhile, would know that that photon has to be in one of four possible states that correlate with the two photons on the ground.
If there were a person riding in the satellite, once they were told that the states of the ground-based photons were the same or different, they would know enough to be able reconstruct the state of the ground-based photons and to duplicate it in their single photon on board. The photons on the ground would have had their quantum state teleported to orbit.
While it sounds like information is traveling faster than light, there's no way to use this property as an instantaneous messaging system. That's because even though the states of entangled particles are correlated, you can't know what they are before you measure them, nor can you control the state.
But what entangled particles can do is act as perfect authenticators for messages. The reason is that the act of observing a particle changes its behavior. If an eavesdropper were trying to intercept the transmission between the satellite and the ground in this recent experiment, the quantum states of the photons (as measured by the scientists) would not be correctly correlated.
The Chinese team managed to make entanglement work over distances of 310 miles (500 km) to 870 miles (1,400 km), the maximum distance to the satellite. This is farther than anyone has ever managed to send entangled states. Entangled photons can't interact with anything else on the way to their destination, because once they do, their states have been ""observed"" – revealed by the interaction. Hence, the teleportation doesn't work if the photons are observed before they get to their destination. When scientists conduct experiments like this one, they don't just send single photons, one at a time; to get the measurements they want, they need to send lots of them. Even in the vacuum of space, out of millions of photons sent, the satellite was only able to reliably receive 911 of them, according to the study. [Infographic: How Quantum Entanglement Works]
If these same photons were sent over fiber-optic cables, rather than through space, the connection between the photons would be destroyed by interference from factors such as heat and vibration, or even random interactions with the cable. As such, it could take 380 billion years to get a measurement from an entangled photon. A satellite, on the other hand, is outside of the atmosphere, and there's much less chance of the entangled photon getting spoiled.
""With fiber you lose many of the photons,"" said Bill Munro, a senior research scientist at NTT's basic research laboratory, in an interview with Live Science. Beaming photons to orbit means that you could build an actual communications system. ""You could beam from China to Washington or New York."" The problem of reducing the interference with the signals and getting more photons through, Munro said, is a technical and engineering problem that can be solved.
Both Munro and Wiseman noted that often people think of teleportation as moving an actual object (or a photon) form one place to another. ""People have this 'Star Trek' approach,"" Munro said. ""They think of atoms being teleported. What we're moving is information from one [quantum] bit to another [quantum] bit. There's no matter — only information. That's hard to get your head around.""
The study appeared in the ArXiv on July 4.

Researchers from MIT and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory determined that environmental radiation—including beta particles, gamma rays, and X-rays—break apart bonded electrons, which then disrupt qubits. Their study was published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.
“If you look back at the last few years of quantum computing development, it's been improving exponentially,” said Ben Loer, a staff physicist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and a co-author of the study. “All we've done is found one more place where it needs to be improved, but we have plenty of ideas on how to do it.”
The basic unit of information in traditional computing is a bit, which can store a 1 or a 0. Quantum computing derives its power from qubits, basic units of information that have the ability to store two states at once. A main challenge in achieving practical quantum computing is improving coherence, or the length of time that a qubit can retain its quantum state—the longer you leave a qubit, the likelier it is to be disrupted by quasiparticles, which are unpaired electrons.
Radiation can originate on Earth or from outer space. Building materials like concrete and brick emit low levels of radiation, and extraterrestrial nuclei produce cosmic radiation when they interact with Earth’s atmosphere. The research team found that without intervention, cosmic and environmental radiation alone would limit the lifespan of a qubit to a few milliseconds. Qubits today last shorter than a thousandth of a millisecond, so solving the radiation problem is crucial to one day achieving practical quantum computing.
A chance encounter inspired the study when Pacific Northwest National Laboratory nuclear physicist Brent VanDevender needed to borrow equipment for an experiment from William Oliver, a quantum information researcher. In the course of lending the equipment, Oliver mentioned that quantum computing had long been puzzled by greater-than-expected amounts of quasiparticles, adding that environmental radiation was an emerging hypothesis.
“Neutrino physicists and dark matter physicists deal with mitigating the effects of radiation all the time—it's one of the hardest parts of our life,” VanDevender said. “It was really natural for us to work with Will Oliver to test that hypothesis, which is what the paper is about.”
In the paper, the authors also propose and test a solution for the radiation in the form of a lead shield, which is commonly used in nuclear and particle physics. They made a shield from 10-cm-thick lead bricks and placed it around a cryostat that keeps the qubits at a low temperature, finding that it mitigated some of the effects of the radiation.
Implementing the change was straightforward, but it was much more challenging to measure its effect, VanDevender said.
“Building the pile of bricks was easy—they sent in a grad student and he hauled them up—but making the actual measurement that demonstrated that the bricks actually had some effect on the qubit, that was a very subtle, small signal,” he said.
That’s because the qubits produced today can only maintain quantum states for microseconds, so measuring any change in their longevity is a tedious effort.
It might seem obvious in hindsight to some that cosmic radiation caused an excess of quasiparticles observed universally, but Loer and VanDevender said that they were met with pushback when presenting the group’s hypothesis.
“After the fact, when we said, 'We've demonstrated that radiation is a source of excess quasiparticles,' everyone said, 'Well yeah, that's obvious,'” Loer said. “But those same people six months earlier—it hadn’t seemed to occur to anybody.”
This may have been because some of the materials they used were commonplace to nuclear physics but not readily available to a quantum information researcher, VanDevender said. For example, he has lead bricks “all over” his nuclear physics lab, but someone who studies qubits would have no reason to stock them, let alone know where to find them.
VanDevender said that future work is in order to determine how each form of radiation affects quasiparticle formation, though the group hypothesizes that each type will have its own, unique effect. There’s also the theoretical question of how high-energy radiation somehow breaks very cold electron pairs into quasiparticles.
Not only can the group’s findings help make better quantum computers; the applications of this research come full circle to inform VanDevender’s and Loer’s physics research.
“As it turns out, the same physics which makes radiation a nuisance for qubits means that something like them should be very good detectors,” VanDevender said. “For Ben and me, searching for dark matter or really rare neutrino interactions, we're sure there are detector technologies to be added that will extend our discovery reach.”",5064,"['g3ckfba', 'g3clzgs', 'g3dtgws', 'g3f0xu1', 'g3cay4d', 'g3ckfba', 'g3clzgs', 'g3dtgws', 'g3f0xu1', 'g3cay4d']"

The amazingly durable creatures have been shot out of guns (opens in new tab), bathed in boiling-hot water, exposed to intense ultraviolet radiation and even (accidentally) crash-landed on the moon (opens in new tab), all to test the limits of their impressive ""tun"" state — a survival mechanism wherein tardigrades curl up into shrunken, dehydrated balls and suspend their biological functions indefinitely in order to endure extreme environmental conditions.
Now, researchers have exposed tardigrades (opens in new tab) to the coldest temperatures and highest pressures that moss piglets have ever survived — not just to test the critters' biological limits, but also to see whether a frozen tardigrade could be incorporated into two quantum entangled electric circuits, then later revived to its normal active state.
The results, reported in a new paper published to the preprint database arXiv (opens in new tab), suggest that, yes — scientists may be able to add ""temporary quantum entanglement (opens in new tab)"" to the tardigrade's growing list of accomplishments. However, early responses to the paper have taken issue with this finding.
If the findings ultimately withstand peer review, then this experiment will represent the first time a living animal has been quantum entangled — a bizarre phenomenon typically confined to the smallest subatomic particles.

Spooky action in a piglet
The phenomenon of quantum entanglement is so strange that even Albert Einstein had his doubts about it, famously nicknaming the process ""spooky action at a distance."" Essentially, the effect occurs when two teeny, tiny subatomic particles become bound to one another so that a change to one particle's spin or momentum instantaneously changes the other particle in the same way — even when the two particles are separated by incredibly large distances.
This effect may be able to transcend the subatomic realm, as scientists attempted to prove in a 2018 paper in the Journal of Physics Communications (opens in new tab). That team found that certain photosynthetic bacteria were capable of becoming entangled with light photons, when the resonant frequency of light in a mirrored room eventually synchronized with the frequency of electrons in the bacteria's photosynthetic molecules, Live Science previously reported (opens in new tab).
The authors of the new arXiv paper decided to test whether a multicellular organism like a tardigrade could develop such a relationship. In their experiment, the team collected three tardigrades from a roof gutter in Denmark. In their animated state, the tardigrades measured between 0.008 and 0.018 inches (0.2 to 0.45 millimeters) — however, after the researchers froze the tardigrades and sent them into a tun state, the animals shrunk to about a third of that size.
From there, the team froze the tardigrades even further, cooling them to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero — the coldest temperature a tardigrade has ever been exposed to and survived.
The team placed each frozen tardigrade between two capacitor plates of a superconductor circuit that formed a quantum bit, or ""qubit"" — a unit of information used in quantum computing. When the tardigrade came into contact with the qubit (named Qubit B), it shifted the qubit's resonant frequency. That tardigrade-qubit-hybrid was then coupled to a second nearby circuit (Qubit A), so that the two qubits became entangled. Over several tests that followed, the researchers saw that the frequency of both qubits and the tardigrade changed in tandem, resembling a three-part entangled system.
Seventeen days after the tardigrades entered their tun states, the researchers gently warmed them up in an attempt to revive them. One of the tardigrades returned to its animated state, while the other two died. That survivor effectively has become the first quantum entangled animal in history, the researchers claimed.
""While one might expect similar physical results from inanimate objects with similar composition to the tardigrade, we emphasize that entanglement is observed with [an] entire organism that retains its biological functionality post experiment,"" the team concluded in their paper. ""At the same time, the tardigrade survived the most extreme and prolonged conditions it has ever been exposed to.""
While the paper has not yet been peer-reviewed, early responses from the scientific community have been critical. Douglas Natelson, Department Chair of physics and astronomy at Rice University in Texas, wrote on his blog (opens in new tab) that the experiment ""did not entangle a tardigrade with a qubit in any meaningful sense.""
""What the authors did here was put a tardigrade on top of the capacitive parts of one of two coupled qubits,"" Natelson wrote. ""The tardigrade is mostly (frozen) water, and here it acts like a dielectric, shifting the resonance frequency of the one qubit that it sat on… This is not entanglement in any meaningful sense.""
Ben Brubaker, a science writer and former physicist agreed (opens in new tab).
""The qubit is an electrical circuit and putting the tardigrade next to it affects it through the laws of electromagnetism we've known about for more than 150 years,"" Brubaker tweeted (opens in new tab). ""Putting a speck of dust next to the qubit would have a similar effect.""
Whether or not the tardigrade experienced any ""spooky action"" from the qubits it was attached to, the study does show that moss piglets are even more durable than previously thought. As exciting as a ""quantum tardigrade"" sounds, this experiment should at least serve as a reminder that regular-old tardigrades are fascinating enough on their own.

Specifically they showed that even today's noisy qubits offer “more value than bits as a medium of storage during computations”.
IBM's quantum team thinks of computing in terms of circuits and at the start of a circuit, there are a number of classical or quantum bits. These bits are set to an initial value and then the circuit progresses forward through a user-written program, made up of gates. While different gates have different effects on these bits, the output of this kind of circuit is a set of zeroes and ones in both the classical and quantum case.

Demonstrating the advantage
In their new academic paper published in Nature Physics titled “Quantum advantage for computations with limited space (opens in new tab)”, IBM Quantum's researchers set out to prove the advantage quantum computers have over classical computers.
They did this by setting up an experiment using circuits restricted to using two-input gates and limited to using one bit of computational/scrap space to answer the question: “How does the computational power differ when a computer has access to classical scratch space versus quantum scratch space?"".
IBM's researchers then proved in their paper that there are functions which a restricted classical computer (opens in new tab) cannot compute but a restricted quantum computer can. To do so, they pitted a real quantum computer against a classical computer.
In order to increase the computational capabilities of the classical computer used in their experiment, the researchers armed it with access to random Boolean (opens in new tab) gates. However, even with access to this randomness, the classical computer was still only able to succeed 87.5 percent of the time while a perfect, noiseless quantum computer would be able to succeed 100 percent of the time according to the findings of IBM's paper.
While today's quantum computers are too noisy to achieve this kind of perfect result, IBM Quantum's researchers still managed to achieve a success rate of 93 percent and beat the classical system when carrying out the experiment in real-life by calibrating special entangling gates to perform these circuits more efficiently.

He’s leader of the Google research group working on building astonishingly powerful computer chips that manipulate data using the quirks of quantum physics. By the end of this year, Martinis says, his team will build a device that achieves “quantum supremacy,” meaning it can perform a particular calculation that’s beyond the reach of any conventional computer. Proof will come from a kind of drag race between Google’s chip and one of the world’s largest supercomputers.
“We think we’re ready to do this experiment. It’s something we can do now,” says Martinis.
One reason for his confidence is that Google’s roughly 25-strong group has made a new quantum chip that tests out key design features needed to make a device for that head-to-head contest.
Quantum chips represent digital bits of data using qubits, devices that can shortcut through some tough calculations by exploiting the counterintuitive physics of quantum mechanics. Researchers have so far demonstrated quantum computing with only small groups of qubits, though. Google has released results from a chip that has nine qubits arranged in a line, but Martinis says he’ll need a grid of 49 qubits for his quantum supremacy experiment.
Google’s latest chip has only six qubits, but they are arranged in a two-by-three configuration that Martinis says shows the company’s technology still works when qubits are nestled side by side, as they will be in larger devices.
The six-qubit chip is also a test of a manufacturing method in which the qubits and the conventional wiring that controls them are made on separate chips later “bump bonded” together. That approach, a major focus of Google’s team since it was established just over two years ago, is intended to eliminate the extra control lines needed in a larger chip, which can interfere with how qubits function.
“That process is all working,” says Martinis. “Now we’re ready to kind of move fast.” Designs for devices with 30 to 50 qubits are already in progress, he says. He briefly flashed up images of the six-qubit chip at the recent IEEE TechIgnite conference in Burlingame, California, but his group has yet to formally disclose technical details.
Martinis joined Google in late 2014 from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he remains a professor today (see “Google Launches Effort to Build Its Own Quantum Computer”). His team is one of several industrial research groups recently formed or expanded thanks to growing signs that the technology behind quantum computing is becoming more tractable. The race to develop quantum processors includes Intel, Microsoft, IBM, and even startups (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2017: Practical Quantum Computers”).
Simon Gustavsson, a principal investigator in a quantum computing research group at MIT, says that Google is one of the leaders. “It’s pretty comparable between Google and IBM,” he says.
Pulling off its quantum supremacy experiment this year would underline the search company’s competitiveness, although quantum processors would need to be much larger than 50 qubits to be capable of useful work.
“It’ll be an academic milestone,” says Chris Monroe, a professor at the University of Maryland and cofounder of the quantum computing startup IonQ. “Afterward you still have to figure out how to make it more scalable and programmable.”
Martinis agrees that much will remain to be done, but he argues that the experiment could become a benchmark for anyone claiming to have a working quantum computer.
He also says the target has helped managers at Google, and the company’s cofounder Sergey Brin, appreciate that the technology is becoming real. “They all get it and are very excited about it,” says Martinis. “We’re trying to get support within Google, and this experiment has been very good to get other engineers talking to us.”

A new report from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine says we need to speed up preparations for the time when super-powerful quantum computers can crack conventional cryptographic defenses.
The experts who produced the report, which was released today, say widespread adoption of quantum-resistant cryptography “will be a long and difficult process” that “probably cannot be completed in less than 20 years.” It’s possible that highly capable quantum machines will appear before then, and if hackers get their hands on them, the result could be a security and privacy nightmare.
Today’s cyberdefenses rely heavily on the fact that it would take even the most powerful classical supercomputers almost unimaginable amounts of time to unravel the cryptographic algorithms that protect our data, computer networks, and other digital systems. But computers that harness quantum bits, or qubits, promise to deliver exponential leaps in processing power that could break today’s best encryption.
Key issue
The report cites an example of encryption that protects the process of swapping identical digital keys between two parties, who use them to decrypt secure messages sent to one another. A powerful quantum computer could crack RSA-1024, a popular algorithmic defense for this process, in less than a day.
Such machines, which would require a couple of thousand “logical” qubits, are probably at least a decade away, say the US experts. Qubits’ delicate quantum state can be disrupted by things like tiny changes in temperature or very slight vibrations, so it can require thousands of linked qubits to produce a single logical one that can be reliably used for computation.
Still, complacency would be a mistake. William Oliver, an MIT physics professor and a member of the group that produced the academies’ report, notes that governments and businesses like banks often need to keep data secure for decades. They therefore need to be thinking now about potential future threats to the encryption they’re using.
Scott Totzke, the CEO of Isara, a startup that’s developing quantum-proof cryptographic solutions, says it’s getting plenty of interest from automakers worried about risks to software in connected cars and other vehicles that will spend many years on roads.
Standard setting
Isara’s work is part of a wider push in the cryptographic community to come up with new encryption methods that can’t be cracked by quantum computers. The academies’ report summarizes several of these methods, and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology is working to develop standards for quantum-proof cryptographic algorithms related to them.
The biggest challenge will be getting these widely adopted. The academies’ experts say negotiating standards, persuading vendors to follow them, and then getting organizations to upgrade their hardware and software can take years. Old data will also need to be reencrypted or destroyed.
Hence the depressing-but-probably-accurate forecast that it will take at least a couple of decades to get quantum-safe cryptography broadly in place. If that holds, we’re going have to hope it somehow takes even longer before a powerful quantum computer ends up in a malicious hacker’s hands.

This is the phenomenon in which objects behave both like particles and like waves.
Numerous experiments have shown that a single particle—an electron or a photon, for example—can interfere with itself, like a wave. The double slit experiment, in which a particle passes through two slits at the same time, is a famous demonstration.
And because all objects are fundamentally quantum in nature, they all have an associated wavelength. So in principle, macroscopic objects should show this kind of wave-particle duality too, given a sensitive enough experiment.
Physicists haven’t yet devised a way to measure the wavelike nature of very large objects, but their ambition in this respect has been steadily increasing. In 1999, they demonstrated the wave-particle duality of fullerene molecules. And other groups have since done the same with even larger molecules.
And that raises the interesting question of how big they can go. Could they, for example, measure the quantum properties of the molecules of life itself?
Today, they get an answer thanks to the work of Armin Shayeghi at the University of Vienna and a few colleagues, who for the first time, have demonstrated quantum interference in molecules of gramicidin, a natural antibiotic made up of 15 amino acids. Their work paves the way for the study of the quantum properties of biomolecules and sets the scene for experiments that exploit the quantum nature of enzymes, DNA, and perhaps one day simple life forms such as viruses.
Shayeghi and co’s experiment is simple in principle. Their approach is to create a beam of ultracold gramicidin molecules and then to measure the interference pattern created when this beam interferes with itself. This interference pattern is then clear evidence of the wavelike nature of the molecules.
That’s easier said than done. The first problem is creating the beam of individual biomolecules, which are particularly fragile and easy to break apart.
Shayeghi and co do this by coating the edge of a spinning wheel with a thin layer of gramicidin. The team then fires a series of short laser pulses at the wheel to knock the gramicidin molecules off the surface. The laser pulses have to be short enough—just a few femtoseconds in length—to kick the biomolecules without damaging them.
The free-floating gramicidin molecules are then swept up in a beam of argon atoms travelling at 600 meters per second. In this beam, the gramicidin has a wavelength of 350 femtometers (1 femtometer is 1x10-15 meters).
The final step is to measure the pattern created by the wave interfering with itself.
This is perhaps the most difficult bit. The wavelength of the beam is about a thousandth that of the biomolecules themselves (as measured by how closely they can pack together). So the team require a technique that can measure patterns on that scale.
That’s where interferometry comes in. The team use an extraordinarily sensitive technique known as Talbot-Lau interferometry to measure the size of the interference pattern.
And the results are persuasive. “The molecular coherence is delocalized over more than 20 times the molecular size,” say Shayeghi and co. This kind of “smearing“ of the biomolecules would be impossible if the gramicidin molecules were pure particles. It is possible only with wavelike interference.
Other researchers have measured wave-particle duality for larger molecules. But they have used techniques that would tear apart the delicate molecules of life. The new technique will allow more detailed study of the quantum properties of biomolecules.
“The successful realization of quantum optics with this polypeptide as a prototypical biomolecule paves the way for quantum assisted molecule metrology and in particular the optical spectroscopy of a large class of biologically relevant molecules,” say the researchers.
That’s interesting research with significant potential to help to tease apart the fabulously complex processes at work in the machinery of life.

This is the point at which a quantum computer is shown to be capable of performing a task that’s beyond the reach of even the most powerful conventional supercomputer. The claim appeared in a paper that was posted on a NASA website, but the publication was then taken down. Google did not respond to a request for comment from MIT Technology Review.
Why NASA? Google struck an agreement last year to use supercomputers available to NASA as benchmarks for its supremacy experiments. According to the Financial Times report, the paper said that Google’s quantum processor was able to perform a calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds that would take today’s most advanced supercomputer, known as Summit, around 10,000 years. In the paper, the researchers said that, to their knowledge, the experiment “marks the first computation that can only be performed on a quantum processor.”
Quantum speed-up: Quantum machines are so powerful because they harness quantum bits, or qubits. Unlike classical bits, which represent either a 1 or a 0, qubits can be in a kind of combination of both at the same time. Thanks to other quantum phenomena, which are described in our explainer here, quantum computers can crunch large amounts of data in parallel that conventional machines have to work through sequentially. Scientists have been working for years to demonstrate that the machines can definitively outperform conventional ones.
How significant is this milestone? Very. In a discussion of quantum computing at MIT Technology Review’s EmTech conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, this week before news of Google’s paper came out, Will Oliver, an MIT professor and quantum specialist, likened the computing milestone to the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk in aviation. He said it would give added impetus to research in the field, which should help quantum machines achieve their promise more quickly. Their immense processing power could ultimately help researchers and companies discover new drugs and materials, create more efficient supply chains, and turbocharge AI.
But, but: It’s not clear what task Google’s quantum machine was working on, but it’s likely to be a very narrow one. In an emailed comment to MIT Technology Review, Dario Gil of IBM, which is also working on quantum computers, says an experiment that was probably designed around a very narrow quantum sampling problem doesn’t mean the machines will rule the roost. “In fact quantum computers will never reign ‘supreme’ over classical ones,” says Gil, “but will work in concert with them, since each have their specific strengths.” For many problems, classical computers will remain the best tool to use.
And another but: Quantum computers are still a long way from being ready for mainstream use. The machines are notoriously prone to errors, because even the slightest change in temperature, or a tiny vibration, can destroy the delicate state of qubits. Researchers are working on machines that will be easier to build, manage, and scale, and some computers are now available via the computing cloud. But it could still be many years before quantum computers that can tackle a wide range of problems are widely available.

The threat comes from quantum computers, which work very differently from the classical computers we use today. Instead of the traditional bits made of 1s and 0s, they use quantum bits that can represent different values at the same time. The complexity of quantum computers could make them much faster at certain tasks, allowing them to solve problems that remain practically impossible for modern machines—including breaking many of the encryption algorithms currently used to protect sensitive data such as personal, trade, and state secrets.
While quantum computers are still in their infancy, incredibly expensive and fraught with problems, officials say efforts to protect the country from this long-term danger need to begin right now.
“The threat of a nation-state adversary getting a large quantum computer and being able to access your information is real,” says Dustin Moody, a mathematician at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). “The threat is that they copy down your encrypted data and hold on to it until they have a quantum computer.”
“Adversaries and nation states are likely doing it,” he says. “It’s a very real threat that governments are aware of. They're taking it seriously and they're preparing for it. That's what our project is doing.”
Faced with this “harvest now and decrypt later” strategy, officials are trying to develop and deploy new encryption algorithms to protect secrets against an emerging class of powerful machines. That includes the Department of Homeland Security, which says it is leading a long and difficult transition to what is known as post-quantum cryptography.
“We don’t want to end up in a situation where we wake up one morning and there’s been a technological breakthrough, and then we have to do the work of three or four years within a few months—with all the additional risks associated with that,” says Tim Maurer, who advises the secretary of homeland security on cybersecurity and emerging technology.
DHS recently released a road map for the transition, beginning with a call to catalogue the most sensitive data, both inside the government and in the business world. Maurer says this is a vital first step “to see which sectors are already doing that, and which need assistance or awareness to make sure they take action now.”
Preparing in advance
Experts say it could still be a decade or more before quantum computers are able to accomplish anything useful, but with money pouring into the field in both China and the US, the race is on to make it happen—and to design better protections against quantum attacks.
The US, through NIST, has been holding a contest since 2016 that aims to produce the first quantum-computer-proof algorithms by 2024, according to Moody, who leads NIST’s project on post-quantum cryptography.
Transitioning to new cryptography is a notoriously tricky and lengthy task, and one it’s easy to ignore until it’s too late. It can be difficult to get for-profit organizations to spend on an abstract future threat years before that threat becomes reality.
“If organizations aren’t thinking about the transition now,” says Maurer, “and then they become overwhelmed by the time the NIST process has been completed and the sense of urgency is there, it increases the risk of accidental incidents … Rushing any such transition is never a good idea.”
As more organizations begin to consider the looming threat, a small and energetic industry has sprouted up, with companies already selling products that promise post-quantum cryptography. But DHS officials have explicitly warned against purchasing them, because there is still no consensus about how such systems will need to work.
“No,” the department stated unequivocally in a document released last month. “Organizations should wait until strong, standardized commercial solutions are available that implement the upcoming NIST recommendations to ensure interoperability as well as solutions that are strongly vetted and globally acceptable.”
But experts are pessimistic about how the transition will go.
If it takes a long time for quantum computers to get to the point where they can solve a useful problem, “I think companies will forget the hype and implement the weakest thing that comes out of NIST until they are suddenly reminded of the problem in 30 years,” Vadim Lyubashevsky, a cryptographer at IBM who’s working on post-quantum cryptographic algorithms with NIST, told MIT Technology Review last year.
And that is exactly the scenario national security officials want to avoid.
Update: One quote from Dustin Moody was added to this story after publication, and the headline was changed to more accurately reflect the content.

It’s fitting that for decades this field has been haunted by the fundamental uncertainty of whether it would, eventually, prove to be a wild goose chase. But Google has collapsed this nagging superposition with research not just demonstrating what’s called “quantum supremacy,” but more importantly showing that this also is only the very beginning of what quantum computers will eventually be capable of.
This is by all indications an important point in computing, but it is also very esoteric and technical in many ways. Consider, however, that in the 60s, the decision to build computers with electronic transistors rather than analog technologies must have seemed rather an esoteric point as well. Yet history shows that was in a way the catalyst for the entire Information Age.
Very few were lucky enough to be involved with that decision or to understand why it was important at the time. But we are lucky enough to be here now — but understanding takes a bit of explanation. The best place to start is perhaps with computing and physics pioneers Alan Turing and Richard Feynman.
‘Because nature isn’t classical, dammit’
The universal computing machine envisioned by Turing and others of his generation was brought to fruition during and after World War II, progressing from vacuum tubes to hand-built transistors to the densely packed chips we have today. With it evolved an idea of computing that essentially said: If it can be represented by numbers, we can simulate it.
That meant that cloud formation, object recognition, voice synthesis, 3D geometry, complex mathematics — all that and more could, with enough computing power, be accomplished on the standard processor-RAM-storage machines (the “Von Neumann” architecture, named after that equally influential thinker) that had become the standard.
But there were exceptions. And although some were obscure things like mathematical paradoxes, it became clear as the field of quantum physics evolved that it may be one of them. It was Feynman who proposed in the early 80s that if you want to simulate a quantum system, you’ll need a quantum system to do it with.
“I’m not happy with all the analyses that go with just the classical theory, because nature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical,” he concluded, in his inimitable way. Classical computers, as he deemed what everyone else just called computers, were insufficient to the task.
The problem? There was no such thing then as a quantum computer, and no one had the slightest idea how to build one. But the gauntlet had been thrown, and it was like catnip to theorists and computer scientists (including Feynman himself), who since then have vied over the idea.
Could it be that with enough ordinary computing power, power on a scale Feynman could hardly imagine — data centers with yottabytes of storage and exaflops of processing — we can in fact simulate nature down to its smallest, spookiest levels?
Or could it be that with some types of problems you hit a wall, and that you can put every computer on Earth to a task and the progress bar will only tick forward a percentage point in a million years, if that?
And, if that’s the case, is it even possible to create a working computer that can solve that problem in a reasonable amount of time?
In order to prove Feynman correct, you would have to answer all of these questions. You’d have to show that there exists a problem that is not merely difficult for ordinary computers, but that is effectively impossible for them to solve even at incredible levels of power. And you would have to not just theorize but create a new computer that not just can but does solve that same problem.
By doing so you would not just prove a theory, you would open up an entirely new class of problem-solving, of theories that can be tested. It would be a moment when an entirely new field of computing first successfully printed “hello world” and was opened up for everyone in the world to use. And that is what the researchers at Google and NASA claim to have accomplished.
In which we skip over how it all actually works
Much has already been written on how quantum computing differs from traditional computing, and I’ll be publishing another story soon detailing Google’s approach. But some basics bear mentioning here.
Classical computers are built around transistors that, by holding or vacating a charge, signify either a 1 or a 0. By linking these transistors together into more complex formations they can represent data, or transform and combine it through logic gates like AND and NOR. With a complex language specific to digital computers that has evolved for decades, we can make them do all kinds of interesting things.
Quantum computers are actually quite similar in that they have a base unit that they perform logic on to perform various tasks. The difference is that the unit is more complex: a qubit, which represents a value in a higher mathematical space than simply “on” or “off.” Their state may be thought of as a location on a sphere, a point in 3D space. The logic is also more complicated, but still relatively basic (and helpfully still called gates): That point can be adjusted, flipped, and so on. Yet the qubit when observed is also digital, providing what amounts to either a 0 or 1 value.
By virtue of representing a value in a richer mathematical space, these qubits and manipulations thereof can perform new and interesting tasks, including some which, as Google shows, we had no ability to do before.
A quantum of contrivance
In order to accomplish the tripartite task summarized above, first the team had to find a problem that classical computers found difficult but that should be relatively easy for a quantum computer to do. The problem they settled on is in a way laughably contrived: Being a quantum computer.
In a way it makes you want to just stop reading, right? Of course a quantum computer is going to be better at being itself than an ordinary computer will be. But it’s not actually that simple.
Think of a cool old piece of electronics — an Atari 800. Sure, it’s very good at being itself and running its programs and so on. But any modern computer can simulate an Atari 800 so well that it could run those programs in orders of magnitude less time. For that matter, a modern computer can be simulated by a supercomputer in much the same way.
Furthermore, there are already ways of simulating quantum computers — they were developed in tandem with real quantum hardware so performance could be compared to theory. These simulators and the hardware they simulate differ widely, and have been greatly improved in recent years as quantum computing became more than a hobby for major companies and research institutions.
To be specific, the problem was simulating the output of a random sequence of gates and qubits in a quantum computer. Briefly stated, when a circuit of qubits does something, the result is, like other computers, a sequence of 0s and 1s. Those sequences, due to the noise-prone nature of qubits and quantum gates, will exhibit randomness — but crucially, they are “random” in a very specific, predictable way.
Think of a pachinko ball falling through its gauntlet of pins, holes and ramps. The path it takes is random in a way, but if you drop 10,000 balls from the exact same position into the exact same maze, patterns will emerge in where they come out at the bottom — a spread of probabilities, perhaps more at the center and less at the edges. If you were to simulate that pachinko machine on a computer, you could test whether your simulation is accurate by comparing the output of 10,000 virtual drops with 10,000 real ones.
It’s the same with simulating a quantum computer, though of course rather more complex. Ultimately however the computer is doing the same thing: simulating a physical process and predicting the results. And like the pachinko simulator, its accuracy can be tested by running the real thing and comparing those results.
But just as it is easier to simulate a simple pachinko machine than a complex one, it’s easier to simulate a handful of qubits than a lot of them. After all, qubits are already complex. And when you get into questions of interference, slight errors and which direction they’d go, etc. — there are, in fact, so many factors, and such mysterious ones, that Feynman made the call that at some point you wouldn’t be able to account for them all. And at that point you would have entered the realm where only a quantum computer can provide those results — the realm of “quantum supremacy.”
Exponential please, and make it a double
After 1,400 words, there’s the phrase everyone else put right in the headline. Why? Because quantum supremacy may sound grand, but it’s only a small part of what was accomplished, and in fact this result in particular may not last forever as an example of having reached those lofty heights. But to continue.
Google’s setup was simple, as quantum computing goes. Set up randomly created circuits of qubits, both in its quantum computer and in the software-based simulator. Start simple with a few qubits doing a handful of operational cycles and compare the time it takes each to produce results.
Bear in mind that the simulator is not running on a laptop next to the fridge-sized quantum computer, but on Summit — a supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Lab currently rated as the most powerful single processing system in the world, and not by a little. It has 2.4 million processing cores, a little under 3 petabytes of memory, and hits about 150 petaflops.
At these early stages, the simulator and the quantum computer happily agreed — the numbers they spat out, the probability spreads, were the same, over millions of trials.
But as more qubits and more complexity got added to the system, the time the simulator took to produce its prediction increased. That’s to be expected, just like a bigger pachinko machine. At first the times for actually executing the calculation and simulating it may have been comparable — a matter of seconds or minutes. But those numbers soon grew hour by hour as they worked their way up to 54 qubits.
When it got to the point where it took the simulator five hours to verify the quantum computer’s result, Google changed its tack. Because more qubits isn’t the only way quantum computing gets more complex (and besides, they couldn’t add any more to their current hardware). Instead, they started performing more rounds of operations with a given circuit, which adds all kinds of complexity to the simulation for a lot of reasons that I couldn’t possibly explain.
For the quantum computer, doing another round of calculations just takes another fraction of a second, and even multiplied by thousands of times to get the required number of runs to produce usable probability numbers, it only ended up taking the machine several extra seconds.
For the simulator, however, verifying these results took a week — a week, on the most powerful computer in the world.
At that point the team had to stop doing the actual simulator testing, since it was so time-consuming and expensive. Yet even so, no one really claimed that they had achieved “quantum supremacy.” After all, it may have taken the biggest classical computer ever created thousands of times longer, but it was still getting done.
So they cranked the dial up another couple notches. 54 qubits, doing 25 cycles, took Google’s Sycamore system 200 seconds. Extrapolating from its earlier results, the team estimated that it would take Summit 10,000 years.
What happened is what the team called double exponential increase. It turns out that adding qubits and cycles to a quantum computer adds a few microseconds or seconds every time — a linear increase. But every qubit you add to a simulated system makes that simulation exponentially more costly to run, and it’s the same story with cycles.
Imagine if you had to do whatever number of push-ups I did, squared, then squared again. If I did 1, you would do 1. If I did 2, you’d do 16. So far no problem. But by the time I get to 10, I’d be waiting for weeks while you finish your 10,000 push-ups. It’s not exactly analogous to Sycamore and Summit, since adding qubits and cycles had different and varying exponential difficulty increases, but you get the idea. At some point you can have to call it. And Google called it when the most powerful computer in the world would still be working on something when in all likelihood this planet will be a smoking ruin.
It’s worth mentioning here that this result does in a way depend on the current state of supercomputers and simulation techniques, which could very well improve. In fact IBM published a paper just before Google’s announcement suggesting that theoretically it could reduce the time necessary for the task described significantly. But it seems unlikely that they’re going to improve by multiple orders of magnitude and threaten quantum supremacy again. After all, if Google and NASA were to add a few more qubits or cycles, the problem gets multiple orders of magnitude harder again. Even so, advances on the classical front are both welcome and necessary for further quantum development.
‘Sputnik didn’t do much, either’
So the quantum computer beat the classical one soundly on the most contrived, lopsided task imaginable, like pitting an apple versus an orange in a “best citrus” competition. So what?
Well, as founder of Google’s Quantum AI lab Hartmut Neven pointed out, “Sputnik didn’t do much either. It just circled the Earth and beeped.” And yet we always talk about an industry having its “Sputnik moment” — because that was when something went from theory to reality, and began the long march from reality to banality.
That seemed to be the attitude of the others on the team I talked with at Google’s quantum computing ground zero near Santa Barbara. Demonstrating quantum superiority is nice, they said, but it’s what they learned in the process that mattered, by confirming that what they were doing wasn’t pointless.
It turns out it’s possible that a result like theirs could be achieved whether or not quantum computing really has a future. Pointing to one of the dozens of nearly incomprehensible graphs and diagrams I was treated to that day, hardware lead and longtime quantum theorist John Martines explained one crucial result: The quantum computer wasn’t doing anything weird and unexpected.
This is very important when doing something completely new. It was entirely possible that in the process of connecting dozens of qubits and forcing them to dance to the tune of the control systems, flipping, entangling, disengaging, and so on — well, something might happen.
Maybe it would turn out that systems with more than 14 entangled qubits in the circuit produce a large amount of interference that breaks the operation. Maybe some unknown force would cause sequential qubit photons to affect one another. Maybe sequential gates of certain types would cause the qubit to decohere and break the circuit. It’s these unknown unknowns that have caused so much doubt over whether, as asked at the beginning, quantum computing really exists as anything more than a parlor trick.
Imagine if they discovered that in digital computers, if you linked too many transistors together, they all spontaneously lost their charge and went to 0. That would put a huge limitation on what a transistor-based digital computer was capable of doing. Until now, no one knew if such a limitation existed for quantum computers. These were the kind of unknown unknowns the team was half-expecting to encounter. But everything worked.
“There’s no new physics out there that will cause this to fail. That’s a big takeaway,” said Martines. “We see the same errors whether we have a simple circuit or complex one, meaning the errors are not dependent on computational complexity or entanglement — which means the complex quantum computing going on doesn’t have fragility to it because you’re doing a complex computation.”
They operated a quantum computer at complexities higher than ever before, and nothing weird happened. And based on their observations and tests, they found that there’s no reason to believe they couldn’t take this same scheme up to, say, a thousand qubits and even greater complexity.
Hello world
That is the true accomplishment of the work the research team did. They found out, in the process of achieving the rather overhyped milestone of quantum superiority, that quantum computers are something that can continue to get better and to achieve more than simply an interesting experimental results.
This was by no means a given — like everything else in the world, quantum or classical, it’s all theoretical until you test it.
It means that sometime soonish, though no one can really say when, quantum computers will be something people will use to accomplish real tasks. From here on out, it’s a matter of getting better, not proving the possibility; of writing code, not theorizing whether code can be executed.
It’s going from Feynman’s proposal that a quantum computer will be needed to using a quantum computer for whatever you need it for. It’s the “hello world” moment for quantum computing.
Feynman, by the way, would probably not be surprised. He knew he was right.

In response, engineers at places like US defense giant Lockheed Martin’s famous “Skunk Works” stepped up work on stealth technology that could shield aircraft from the prying eyes of enemy radar.
The innovations that resulted include unusual shapes that deflect radar waves—like the US B-2 bomber’s “flying wing” design (above)—as well as carbon-based materials and novel paints. Stealth technology isn’t yet a Harry Potter–like invisibility cloak: even today’s most advanced warplanes still reflect some radar waves. But these signals are so small and faint they get lost in background noise, allowing the aircraft to pass unnoticed.
China and Russia have since gotten stealth aircraft of their own, but America’s are still better. They have given the US the advantage in launching surprise attacks in campaigns like the war in Iraq that began in 2003.
This advantage is now under threat. In November 2018, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), China’s biggest defense electronics company, unveiled a prototype radar that it claims can detect stealth aircraft in flight. The radar uses some of the exotic phenomena of quantum physics to help reveal planes’ locations.
It’s just one of several quantum-inspired technologies that could change the face of warfare. As well as unstealthing aircraft, they could bolster the security of battlefield communications and affect the ability of submarines to navigate the oceans undetected. The pursuit of these technologies is triggering a new arms race between the US and China, which sees the emerging quantum era as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gain the edge over its rival in military tech.
Stealth spotter
How quickly quantum advances will influence military power will depend on the work of researchers like Jonathan Baugh. A professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada, Baugh is working on a device that’s part of a bigger project to develop quantum radar. Its intended users: stations in the Arctic run by the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, a joint US-Canadian organization.
Baugh’s machine generates pairs of photons that are “entangled”—a phenomenon that means the particles of light share a single quantum state. A change in one photon immediately influences the state of the other, even if they are separated by vast distances.
Quantum radar operates by taking one photon from every pair generated and firing it out in a microwave beam. The other photon from each pair is held back inside the radar system.
Only a few of the photons sent out will be reflected back if they hit a stealth aircraft. A conventional radar wouldn’t be able to distinguish these returning photons from the mass of other incoming ones created by natural phenomena—or by radar-jamming devices. But a quantum radar can check for evidence that incoming photons are entangled with the ones held back. Any that are must have originated at the radar station. This enables it to detect even the faintest of return signals in a mass of background noise.
Baugh cautions that there are still big engineering challenges. These include developing highly reliable streams of entangled photons and building extremely sensitive detectors. It’s hard to know if CETC, which already claimed in 2016 that its radar could detect objects up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) away, has solved these challenges; it’s keeping the technical details of its prototype a secret.
Seth Lloyd, an MIT professor who developed the theory underpinning quantum radar, says that in the absence of hard evidence, he’s skeptical of the Chinese company’s claims. But, he adds, the potential of quantum radar isn’t in doubt. When a fully functioning device is finally deployed, it will mark the beginning of the end of the stealth era.
China’s ambitions
CETC’s work is part of a long-term effort by China to turn itself into a world leader in quantum technology. The country is providing generous funding for new quantum research centers at universities and building a national research center for quantum science that’s slated to open in 2020. It’s already leaped ahead of the US in registering patents in quantum communications and cryptography (see chart).
A study of China’s quantum strategy published in September 2018 by the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), a US think tank, noted that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is recruiting quantum specialists, and that big defense companies like China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC) are setting up joint quantum labs at universities. Working out exactly which projects have a military element to them is hard, though. “There’s a degree of opacity and ambiguity here, and some of that may be deliberate,” says Elsa Kania, a coauthor of the CNAS study.
China’s efforts are ramping up just as fears are growing that the US military is losing its competitive edge. A commission tasked by Congress to review the Trump administration’s defense strategy issued a report in November 2018 warning that the US margin of superiority “is profoundly diminished in key areas” and called for more investment in new battlefield technologies.
One of those technologies is likely to be quantum communication networks. Chinese researchers have already built a satellite that can send quantum-encrypted messages between distant locations, as well as a terrestrial network that stretches between Beijing and Shanghai. Both projects were developed by scientific researchers, but the know-how and infrastructure could easily be adapted for military use.
The networks rely on an approach known as quantum key distribution (QKD). Messages are encoded in the form of classical bits, and the cryptographic keys needed to decode them are sent as quantum bits, or qubits. These qubits are typically photons that can travel easily across fiber-optic networks or through the atmosphere. If an enemy tries to intercept and read the qubits, this immediately destroys their delicate quantum state, wiping out the information they carry and leaving a telltale sign of an intrusion.
QKD technology isn’t totally secure yet. Long ground networks require way stations similar to the repeaters that boost signals along an ordinary data cable. At these stations, the keys are decoded into classical form before being re-encoded in a quantum form and sent to the next station. While the keys are in classical form, an enemy could hack in and copy them undetected.
To overcome this issue, a team of researchers at the US Army Research Laboratory in Adelphi, Maryland, is working on an approach called quantum teleportation. This involves using entanglement to transfer data between a qubit held by a sender and another held by a receiver, using what amounts to a kind of virtual, one-time-only quantum data cable. (There’s a more detailed description here.)
Michael Brodsky, one of the researchers, says he and his colleagues have been working on a number of technical challenges, including finding ways to ensure that the qubits’ delicate quantum state isn’t disrupted during transmission through fiber-optic networks. The technology is still confined to a lab, but the team says it’s now robust enough to be tested outside. “The racks can be put on trucks, and the trucks can be moved to the field,” explains Brodsky.
It may not be long before China is testing its own quantum teleportation system. Researchers are already building the fiber-optic network for one that will stretch from the city of Zhuhai, near Macau, to some islands in Hong Kong.
Quantum compass
Researchers are also exploring using quantum approaches to deliver more accurate and foolproof navigation tools to the military. US aircraft and naval vessels already rely on precise atomic clocks to help keep track of where they are. But they also count on signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS), a network of satellites orbiting Earth. This poses a risk because an enemy could falsify, or “spoof,” GPS signals—or jam them altogether.
Lockheed Martin thinks American sailors could use a quantum compass based on microscopic synthetic diamonds with atomic flaws known as nitrogen-vacancy centers, or NV centers. These quantum defects in the diamond lattice can be harnessed to form an extremely accurate magnetometer. Shining a laser on diamonds with NV centers makes them emit light at an intensity that varies according to the surrounding magnetic field.
Ned Allen, Lockheed’s chief scientist, says the magnetometer is great at detecting magnetic anomalies—distinctive variations in Earth’s magnetic field caused by magnetic deposits or rock formations. There are already detailed maps of these anomalies made by satellite and terrestrial surveys. By comparing anomalies detected using the magnetometer against these maps, navigators can determine where they are. Because the magnetometer also indicates the orientation of magnetic fields, ships and submarines can use them to work out which direction they are heading.
China’s military is clearly worried about threats to its own version of GPS, known as BeiDou. Research into quantum navigation and sensing technology is under way at various institutes across the country, according to the CNAS report.
As well as being used for navigation, magnetometers can also detect and track the movement of large metallic objects, like submarines, by fluctuations they cause in local magnetic fields. Because they are very sensitive, the magnetometers are easily disrupted by background noise, so for now they are used for detection only at very short distances. But last year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences let slip that some Chinese researchers had found a way to compensate for this using quantum technology. That might mean the devices could be used in the future to spot submarines at much longer ranges.
A tight race
It’s still early days for militaries' use of quantum technologies. There’s no guarantee they will work well at scale, or in conflict situations where absolute reliability is essential. But if they do succeed, quantum encryption and quantum radar could make a particularly big impact. Code-breaking and radar helped change the course of World War II. Quantum communications could make stealing secret messages much harder, or impossible. Quantum radar would render stealth planes as visible as ordinary ones. Both things would be game-changing.
It’s also too early to tell whether it will be China or the US that comes out on top in the quantum arms race—or whether it will lead to a Cold War–style stalemate. But the money China is pouring into quantum research is a sign of how determined it is to take the lead.
China has also managed to cultivate close working relationships between government research institutes, universities, and companies like CSIC and CETC. The US, by comparison, has only just passed legislation to create a national plan for coordinating public and private efforts. The delay in adopting such an approach has led to a lot of siloed projects and could slow the development of useful military applications. “We’re trying to get the research community to take more of a systems approach,” says Brodsky, the US army quantum expert.
Still, the US military does have some distinct advantages over the PLA. The Department of Defense has been investing in quantum research for a very long time, as have US spy agencies. The knowledge generated helps explains why US companies lead in areas like the development of powerful quantum computers, which harness entangled qubits to generate immense amounts of processing power.
The American military can also tap into work being done by its allies and by a vibrant academic research community at home. Baugh’s radar research, for instance, is funded by the Canadian government, and the US is planning a joint research initiative with its closest military partners—Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand—in areas like quantum navigation.
All this has given the US has a head start in the quantum arms race. But China’s impressive effort to turbocharge quantum research means the gap between them is closing fast.

The headlines have been incredible. Newsweek (Scientists Have Reversed Time in a Quantum Computer), Discover (Scientists Used IBM’s Quantum Computer to Reverse Time, Possibly Breaking a Law of Physics) and the UK’s Independent newspaper (Scientists ‘Reverse Time’ With Quantum Computer in Breakthrough Study). Cosmopolitan magazine also chimed in: Scientists just turned back time and it’s like Back to the Future is coming true. There are many, many more.
The trigger for all of these was a Scientific Reports paper with the provocative title “Arrow of time and its reversal on the IBM quantum computer.” In it, the authors claimed to have performed an experiment that opens up lines of research, in their words, toward “investigating time reversal and the backward time flow.”
If you had difficulty understanding how scientists accomplished such a counterintuitive feat, don’t worry. They didn’t.
Some simple physical models are symmetric in time. Think of an idealized version of the Earth orbiting the sun, where each is a perfect sphere. Look at that system going forward in time, and the Earth orbits in a clockwise direction. “Reverse” time and instead the Earth will travel in a counterclockwise orbit. Both are equally realistic. Or think of two billiard balls colliding. You can run the video in either direction and it still seems physically plausible.
The real world is not that way. Things look different going forward in time from how they would were time reversed—in a number of different ways, among them that entropy (very loosely speaking, a measure of disorder) increases. This is a law both of physics and of common sense. (For a fun and sad exploration of how strange reversing the flow of time would make things, check out Time’s Arrow by Martin Amis. And if you really want to get into the weeds on the physics of time travel, try here.)
So if they didn’t invent time travel, what did these scientists actually do?
Think about pressing rewind on a video. That “reverses the flow of time,” in a way. If you’ve never seen it before, it’s kind of neat. It might let you see things—like steam flowing back into a tea kettle or Humpty Dumpty spontaneously assembling from a jumble of broken pieces—that appear to “reverse the arrow of time.” The paper in question describes a quantum-computing version of such a video running in reverse.
A closer analogy is a lens, like what one would find in a telescope, a microscope, or eyeglasses. A lens can be used to focus light—“reversing” the dispersal of light that had gone out of focus. The authors of the paper, from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, and ETH Zurich, say their technique might be useful for testing quantum programs. This is correct. But it’s a lot less interesting than a time machine.
As Scott Aaronson, director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas at Austin, says, “If you’re simulating a time-reversible process on your computer, then you can ‘reverse the direction of time’ by simply reversing the direction of your simulation. From a quick look at the paper, I confess that I didn’t understand how this becomes more profound if the simulation is being done on IBM’s quantum computer.”
Other quantum computing experts we spoke to agreed. One, who did not wish to be named, said: “I don’t know how useful this is … it doesn’t mean that these guys made a time machine. They certainly didn’t violate the laws of thermodynamics or the laws of physics.” He added: “This is the type of hype that is going to give quantum computing a bad name.”
He’s right. Wild headlines don’t just give quantum computing a bad name. They do damage to science as a whole by convincing the public that science is so bewildering it’s beyond their comprehension. It’s tough enough to explain the paradoxes that actually exist in quantum mechanics without sensationalist embellishment. Time, whether any of us likes it or not, marches on.
This article was originally published under the headline: ""No, IBM didn’t just 'reverse time' with a quantum computer."" While this is accurate, the headline was modified to reflect the fact that though the researchers in question used publicly-available IBM quantum computing facilities, they are not affiliated with the company.

The news: Quantum tech promises to allow data to be sent securely over long distances. Scientists have already shown it’s possible to transmit information both on land and via satellites using quantum bits, or qubits. Now physicists at the University of Science and Technology of China and the University of Vienna in Austria have found a way to ship even more data using something called quantum trits, or qutrits.
Qutrits? Oh, come on, you’ve just made that up: Nope, they’re real. Conventional bits used to encode everything from financial records to YouTube videos are streams of electrical or photonic pulses than can represent either a 1 or a 0. Qubits, which are typically electrons or photons, can carry more information because they can be polarized in two directions at once, so they can represent both a 1 and a 0 at the same time. Qutrits, which can be polarized in three different dimensions simultaneously, can carry even more information. In theory, this can then be transmitted using quantum teleportation.
Quantum … what? Quantum teleportation is a method for shipping data that relies on an almost-mystical phenomenon called entanglement. Entangled quantum particles can influence one another’s state, even if they are continents apart. In teleportation, a sender and receiver each receive one of a pair of entangled qubits. The sender measures the interaction of their qubit with another one that holds data they want to send. By applying the results of this measurement to the other entangled qubit, the receiver can work out what information has been transmitted. (For a more detailed look at quantum teleportation, see our explainer here.)
Measuring progress: Getting this to work with qubits isn’t easy—and harnessing qutrits is even harder because of that extra dimension. But the researchers, who include Jian-Wei Pan, a Chinese pioneer of quantum communication, say they have cracked the problem by tweaking the first part of the teleportation process so that senders have more measurement information to pass on to receivers. This will make it easier for the latter to work out what data has been teleported over. The research was published in the journal Physical Review Letters.
Deterring hackers: This might seem rather esoteric, but it has huge implications for cybersecurity. Hackers can snoop on conventional bits flowing across the internet without leaving a trace. But interfering with quantum units of information causes them to lose their delicate quantum state, leaving a telltale sign of hacking. If qutrits can be harnessed at scale, they could form the backbone of an ultra-secure quantum internet that could be used to send highly sensitive government and commercial data.

The general idea is to use the special properties of quantum mechanics to make measurements or produce images that are otherwise impossible.
Much of this work is done with photons. But as far as the electromagnetic spectrum is concerned, the quantum revolution has been a little one-sided. Almost all the advances in quantum computing, cryptography, teleportation, and so on have involved visible or near-visible light.
Today that changes thanks to the work of Shabir Barzanjeh at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and a few colleagues. This team has used entangled microwaves to create the world’s first quantum radar. Their device, which can detect objects at a distance using only a few photons, raises the prospect of stealthy radar systems that emit little detectable electromagnetic radiation.
The device is simple in essence. The researchers create pairs of entangled microwave photons using a superconducting device called a Josephson parametric converter. They beam the first photon, called the signal photon, toward the object of interest and listen for the reflection.
In the meantime, they store the second photon, called the idler photon. When the reflection arrives, it interferes with this idler photon, creating a signature that reveals how far the signal photon has traveled. Voila—quantum radar!
This technique has some important advantages over conventional radar. Ordinary radar works in a similar way but fails at low power levels that involve small numbers of microwave photons. That’s because hot objects in the environment emit microwaves of their own.
In a room temperature environment, this amounts to a background of around 1,000 microwave photons at any instant, and these overwhelm the returning echo. This is why radar systems use powerful transmitters.
Entangled photons overcome this problem. The signal and idler photons are so similar that it is easy to filter out the effects of other photons. So it becomes straightforward to detect the signal photon when it returns.
Of course, entanglement is a fragile property of the quantum world, and the process of reflection destroys it. Nevertheless, the correlation between the signal and idler photons is still strong enough to distinguish them from background noise.
This allows Barzanjeh and co to detect a room temperature object in a room temperature environment with just a handful of photons, in a way that is impossible to do with ordinary photons. “We generate entangled fields using a Josephson parametric converter at millikelvin temperatures to illuminate a room-temperature object at a distance of 1 meter in a proof of principle radar setup,” they say.
The researchers go on to compare their quantum radar with conventional systems operating with similarly low numbers of photons and say it significantly outperforms them, albeit only over relatively short distances.
That’s interesting work revealing the significant potential of quantum radar and a first application of microwave-based entanglement. But it also shows the potential application of quantum illumination more generally.
A big advantage is the low levels of electromagnetic radiation required. “Our experiment shows the potential as a non-invasive scanning method for biomedical applications, e.g., for imaging of human tissues or non-destructive rotational spectroscopy of proteins,” say Barzanjeh and co.
Then there is the obvious application as a stealthy radar that is difficult for adversaries to detect over background noise. The researchers say it could be useful for short-range low-power radar for security applications in closed and populated environments.

It was an ambitious open research project aimed at exploring both the capabilities of quantum computer architecture and the mysteries of space exploration — but in the months since, they've stayed quiet about exactly what kind of work they've been doing there.
Operated at near-absolute-zero temperatures
Tomorrow, they're breaking the silence with a brief short film, set to debut at the Imagine Science Films Festival at Google New York. The film takes a look at various researchers working on the project, as well as the computer itself, which has to be operated at near-absolute-zero temperatures. Researchers hope the quantum architecture will eventually be used to optimize solutions across complex and interconnected sets of variables currently outside the capabilities of conventional computing. That could allow for new solutions in computational medicine or help NASA to construct a more comprehensive picture of the known universe. ""We don't know what the best questions are to ask that computer,"" says NASA's Eleanor Rieffel in the video. ""That's exactly what we're trying to understand.""
Video provided by Google
""We don't know what the best questions are to ask that computer.""
Beyond the film, Google says it's made great leaps in recent experiments with the quantum chips, determining which algorithms work better in a quantum setup and providing further evidence that the D-Wave processor uses quantum entanglement, a behavior that links particles with no apparent physical connection between them. D-Wave has always claimed that its chips involved entanglement, but it had been difficult to conclusively demonstrate before now.
The first practical application has been on Google Glass, as engineers put the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks. For engineering reasons, the quantum processor can never be installed in Glass, but together with Google's conventional server centers, it can point the way to a better blink-detecting algorithm.

Then again, it would say that
America's National Security Agency has published an FAQ about quantum cryptography, saying it does not know ""when or even if"" a quantum computer will ever exist to ""exploit"" public-key cryptography.
In the document, titled Quantum Computing and Post-Quantum Cryptography, the NSA said it ""has to produce requirements today for systems that will be used for many decades in the future."" With that in mind, the agency came up with some predictions [PDF] for the near future of quantum computing and their impact on encryption.
Is the NSA worried about the threat posed by a ""cryptographically relevant quantum computer"" (CRQC)? Apparently not too much.
""NSA does not know when or even if a quantum computer of sufficient size and power to exploit public key cryptography (a CRQC) will exist,"" it stated, which sounds fairly conclusive – though in 2014 the agency splurged $80m looking for a quantum computer that could smash current encryption in a program titled Owning the Net, so the candor of the paper's statements is perhaps open to debate.
What the super-surveillance agency seems to be saying is that it's not a given that a CRQC capable of breaking today's public-key algorithms will ever emerge, though it wouldn't be a bad idea to consider coming up with and using new techniques that could defeat a future CRQC, should one be built.
It's almost like the NSA is dropping a not-so-subtle hint, though why it would is debatable. If it has a CRQC, or is on the path to one, it might want to warn allies, vendors, and citizens to think about using quantum-resistant technologies in case bad people develop a CRQC too. But why would the spies tip their hand so? It's all very curious.
Progress on quantum computers has been steadily made over the past few years, and while they may not ever replace our standard, classical computing, they are very effective at solving certain problems
Eric Trexler, VP of global governments at security shop Forcepoint, told The Register: ""Progress on quantum computers has been steadily made over the past few years, and while they may not ever replace our standard, classical computing, they are very effective at solving certain problems. This includes public-key asymmetric cryptography, one of the two different types of cryptosystems in use today.""
Public-key cryptography is what the world relies on for strong encryption, such as TLS and SSL that underpin the HTTPS standard used to help protect your browser data from third-party snooping.
In the NSA's summary, a CRQC – should one ever exist – ""would be capable of undermining the widely deployed public key algorithms used for asymmetric key exchanges and digital signatures"" – and what a relief it is that no one has one of these machines yet. The post-quantum encryption industry has long sought to portray itself as an immediate threat to today's encryption, as El Reg detailed in 2019.
""The current widely used cryptography and hashing algorithms are based on certain mathematical calculations taking an impractical amount of time to solve,"" explained Martin Lee, a technical lead at Cisco's Talos infosec arm. ""With the advent of quantum computers, we risk that these calculations will become easy to perform, and that our cryptographic software will no longer protect systems.""
Given that nations and labs are working toward building crypto-busting quantum computers, the NSA said it was working on ""quantum-resistant public key"" algorithms for private suppliers to the US government to use, having had its Post-Quantum Standardization Effort running since 2016. However, the agency said there are no such algos that commercial vendors should adopt right now, ""with the exception of stateful hash signatures for firmware.""
Smart cookies will be glad to hear that the NSA considers AES-256 and SHA-384 ""safe against attack by a large quantum computer.""

Jason Soroko, CTO of Sectigo, a vendor that advertises ""quantum safe cryptography"" said the NSA report wasn't conclusive proof that current encryption algos were safe from innovation.
""Quantum computers alone do not crack public key cryptography,"" he said, adding that such a beast would need to execute an implementation of Shor’s algorithm. That algo was first described in 1994 by an MIT maths professor and allows for the calculation of prime factors of very large numbers; a vital step towards speeding up the decryption of the product of current encryption algorithms.
""Work on quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms is pushing forward based on the risk that ‘Universal’ quantum computers will eventually have enough stable qubits to eventually implement Shor’s algorithm,"" continued Soroko. ""I think it’s important to assume that innovation in both math and engineering will potentially surprise us.""
While advances in cryptography are of more than merely academic interest to the infosec world, there is always the point that security (and data) breaches occur because of primarily human factors. Ransomware, currently the largest threat to enterprises, typically spreads because someone's forgotten to patch or decommission a machine on a corporate network – or because somebody opens an attachment from a malicious email.
Or there's the old joke about rubber hose cryptanalysis, referring to beating the passwords out of a captured sysadmin.
Talos' Lee concluded: “In a world where users will divulge their passwords in return for chocolate or in response to an enticing phishing email, the risk of quantum computers might not be our biggest threat.” ®",6057,"['hbab5ji', 'hbad8a5', 'hbadnw6', 'hbbnnk2', 'hbbhsw4', 'hbca0u6', 'hbaxhna', 'hbbamt4', 'hbaj2lk', 'hbaceoy', 'hbba7ib', 'hbbfco3', 'hce05f6', 'hbbq34t', 'hbact2f']"

300 atoms do more than computer “larger than known universe”
An international team of scientists has created a quantum device with “the potential to perform calculations that would require a supercomputer larger than the size of the known universe.”
So says the University of Sydney's Dr Michael Biercuk of the University's School of Physics, the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems and the team that worked on the device discussed in a Nature paper released yesterday.
The quantum device in question uses a pancake-shaped crystal of beryllium ions – 300 to be precise – that Bieruck says the team built “from scratch, atom by atom”. He told ABC radio that lasers, pumps and vacuum chambers were used to create the disc, and that the rig occupies only a single room.
But the number of programmable qubits the crystal offers, the team say, has computational potential that is orders of magnitude – by a factor of 1080 - beyond current supercomputers.
While very exciting, Bieruck also admits that no known computer can check the accuracy of calculations performed with the new quantum simulator. So there's no need to apply for that course in Q++ just yet!
Bieruck talks about the simulator and plays with some important-looking gadgets in the video below. ®",1352,"['c4gq5os', 'c4gptih', 'c4gobfl', 'c4gsh1v', 'c4golvu', 'c4gt92e', 'c4guuub', 'c4gwiej', 'c4gx9pd', 'c4gshx8']"

A joint project between Google, NASA, and the Universities Space Research Association, the Quantum AI Lab today announced a multiyear agreement to install a D-Wave 2X, a state-of-the-art quantum processor released earlier this year. With over 1,000 qubits, the machine is the most powerful computer of its kind, and will be put to work tackling difficult optimization problems for both Google and NASA.
The fragility of the qubits also means the computer's processor can only operate at extremely cold temperatures. The 2X's standard operating temperature is less than 15 millikelvin, a temperature far colder than outer space.

""Working with the D-Wave processors has helped us develop and fine-tune models of quantum annealing,"" Google's Hartmut Neven, head of the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, said in a statement. ""We look forward to the continued advancements coming from each generation of D-Wave systems.""
But while the lab moves to test the new machine's capabilities, there are still real questions about whether D-Wave's approach to quantum computing will yield results. Benchmarking tests on D-Wave's previous models have failed to find evidence of the so-called ""quantum speedup"" — the exponential increase in computing power that makes quantum computing so appealing. D-Wave has proposed alternate benchmarks that show something closer to a speedup, but for most experts, the debate is still unsettled.
At the same time, D-Wave's computers aren't Google's only play in the quantum computing space. The company's biggest rival in the quantum computing space is a team of scientists from UC Santa Barbara team that was hired by Google in 2014. Where D-Wave chains together hundreds of qubits with higher error rates, the UC Santa Barbara group is working with smaller numbers of more reliable qubits, and struggling to maintain low error rates at the scale of the D-Wave machine. It remains to be seen which model has the better shot — but if either one succeeds, Google will have first pick of the results.

The 16-qubit computer will be available to developers and researchers at no cost through the IBM Cloud service. The 17-qubit quantum computer will be sold as a prototype commercial product to other companies.
A qubit is the basic unit of information in a quantum computer, as well as the quantum equivalent of a ""bit"" in the conventional computing world. However, instead of having a value of either 0 or 1, it can have 0, 1, or both values at the same time. This is called ""superposition,"" and it's a fundamental property of quantum computing.
Towards Quantum Supremacy
IBM and Google believe that “quantum supremacy,” or the moment when quantum computers will solve at least some problems faster than the fastest supercomputers on Earth, will be achieved when we can build a quantum computer with around 50 qubits. Both companies plan to have such a computer ready in the next few years.
So far most universal quantum computers have been stuck at five or fewer qubits, with Google being one of the few to break apart with its nine-qubit quantum computer (opens in new tab). Google’s computer was also able to demonstrate one of the first practical applications of universal quantum computers by accurately simulating a hydrogen H2 molecule.
Although we don’t know yet if Google has further upgraded its quantum computer since it last talked about the nine-qubit one, IBM seems to have one-upped Google this time with 16- and 17-qubit quantum computers.
IBM’s New Quantum Computers
The 16-qubit quantum computer will allow more complex experimentation than its previous five-qubit system, according to IBM. It will be freely accessible to developers, programmers, and researchers who want to run quantum algorithms, work with individual qubits, or explore tutorials and simulations. Beta access is available through the IBM Quantum Experience program, and a new software development kit (SDK) is available on GitHub.
The 17-qubit quantum computer leverages significant improvements in materials, device, and architecture to make it IBM’s most powerful universal quantum computer. The chip is still a prototype but it will be offered for sale to interested businesses looking to do a quantum leap (get it?) over their competitors.
""The significant engineering improvements announced today will allow IBM to scale future processors to include 50 or more qubits, and demonstrate computational capabilities beyond today’s classical computing systems,” said Arvind Krishna, senior vice president and director of IBM Research and Hybrid Cloud. “These powerful upgrades to our quantum systems, delivered via the IBM Cloud, allow us to imagine new applications and new frontiers for discovery that are virtually unattainable using classical computers alone,” he added.
Quantum Volume
Although IBM seems to already be ahead of everyone else when it comes to the number of quits in universal quantum computers--with the exception of D-Wave’s 2,000 qubit system, which is not a universal quantum computer--it noted that the number of qubits isn’t the most important factor, or, rather, not the only factor that matters.
Due to the fragile nature of quantum information, the quality of the qubits, how they talk to each other, and minimizing quantum errors are even more important when it comes to increasing the computational power of a quantum system.
This is why IBM has adopted a new metric, which it calls “quantum volume,” to measure the computational power of quantum computers. According to the company, the quantum volume metric accounts for the number and quality of qubits, circuit connectivity, and error rates of operations. IBM also noted that its 17-qubit prototype offers a significant improvement in quantum volume over previous quantum computers.
Over the next few years, IBM plans to increase the quantum volume of its qubits even more aggressively by improving all aspects of its quantum processors, including increasing their qubit number to 50 or more.",4067,"['dhptmfv', 'dhpzfa0', 'dhpxlc1', 'dhpz1hr', 'dhq313z', 'dhq2831', 'dhq9jry', 'dhqb4w3', 'dhqe7qs', 'dhq4hnc', 'dhptmfv', 'dhpzfa0', 'dhpxlc1', 'dhpz1hr', 'dhq313z', 'dhq2831', 'dhq9jry', 'dhqb4w3', 'dhqe7qs', 'dhq4hnc']"

(QCI) has staked a claim to fame by solving a 3,854-variable optimization issue for BMW. The company made use of its new hardware-based quantum computing solution, Entropy Quantum Computing (EQC), to solve for the ideal placement of vehicle sensors in BMW's Vehicle Sensor Placement Challenge (VSPC) 2022. Its new quantum system delivered performance that was 70 times higher that of its 2021 entry, which leveraged the company's hybrid quantum implementation derived from quantum computing player D-Wave.
“We are very proud to have achieved what we believe to be an important landmark result in the evolution of quantum,” said Bob Liscouski, CEO of QCI in a press release. “We believe that this proves that innovative quantum computing technologies can solve real business problems today. What’s even more significant is the complexity of the problem solved. This wasn’t just a rudimentary problem to show that quantum solutions will be feasible someday; this was a very real and significant problem whose solution can potentially contribute to accelerating the realization of the autonomous vehicle industry.”
This marks a usage of quantum computing to solve actionable, real-world problems that would take classical computers exponentially longer times to solve. QCI says this proves the advantages of its approach to quantum computing compared to other quantum systems available today. Alternatives such as IBM's 127-qubit Eagle Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) and Quantum Brilliance's diamond-based QPUs (already deployed in datacenter environments) are all classed as Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. QCI says its demonstration is proof of it achieving quantum advantage (the moment where quantum computers solve problems that would be impossible for classical systems).
Placing sensors in vehicles - and especially autonomous vehicles - is an incredible challenge. A multitude of variables have to be taken into account - variables such as chassis design (which has implications on vehicle security), absence of obstruction (different placements offer different fields of view or allow for lower error possibility), wind resistance and weight balancing, just to name a few.
It's a problem that requires numerous trial-and-error processes that may not render the optimal solution, and which have to be redone for every new vehicle and every new sensor advancement. This is part of the reason why vehicle design has remained relatively lifeless for years now - deviation from already-known solutions adds cost, which then cuts into profits.
Due to the number of variables and constraints (QCI quotes 3,854 variables and 500 constraints imposed on the solution), computing all of the possible positions for sensor placement on a classical system hits walls on cost — compute time is an expensive pursuit, as F1 teams will tell you.
Even before money is counted, the very real cost of compute time within classical systems has rendered many, many problems unsolvable (such as logistics management, step sequencing and prioritization).
Those are problems that quantum computing, with its probabilistic approach to computing, can solve in a fraction of the time. So much so that QCI solved BMW's optimization problem in under six minutes, delivering the best-possible solution to the placement problem at hand. In so doing, it delivered a solution consisting of 15 sensors, which yielded a 96% vehicle coverage by leveraging QCI’s quantum hardware and software system.
In responding to the VSPC, QCI leveraged a new hardware form of quantum computing. Entropy Quantum Computing, as it's called, does away with the requirements for a close-to-perfect environment on which the qubits operate, lowering design, installation and operating costs substantially. Entropy refers to the natural evolution of any system, which tends to occur towards chaos (or in this case, disorder).
When you can get away with a noisier environment (in which temperatures, electromagnetic radiation and other variables are more forgiving of the quantum system's coherence), deployment of quantum computers becomes much more feasible.
Coherence is a fundamental requirement of quantum computers, as changes in its environment can cause it to inadvertently change states - introducing costly and sometimes computing-killing errors into the calculations.
QCI's Entropy Quantum Computing approach works by taking into account the environment itself into the calculation results. Time and cost are saved by not having to control for all variables outside the Quantum Processing Unit itself - instead, the system adapts to the changing environment, analyzing its feedback and what it means for the qubits' quantum states.
Simplifying things immensely, think about how modern processors dynamically change voltages and frequency according to the workload, while taking into account variables such power consumption and operating temperature.
The commercial and general feasibility of QCI's quantum computing solution remains to be seen; it's interesting to note that companies with more resources and history than QCI have opted for other approaches to quantum computing. Others, like Microsoft, are still chasing their own specific qubits. Each and every one of them extoll the merits of their chosen approach.
It's not so much a race (although there is a race towards funding and market share) as it is about exploring different venues for quantum computing. It perhaps speaks to the complexity of it that there are so many possible approaches towards harnessing what is likely to become the next big frontier for computing sciences.",5667,"['iibt7ti', 'iibqche', 'iibnb26', 'iibref5', 'iicwg1c', 'iic1nt7', 'iibq4x5', 'iibxpfa', 'iibtk41', 'iid5fek']"

This is the phenomenon in which objects behave both like particles and like waves.
Numerous experiments have shown that a single particle—an electron or a photon, for example—can interfere with itself, like a wave. The double slit experiment, in which a particle passes through two slits at the same time, is a famous demonstration.
And because all objects are fundamentally quantum in nature, they all have an associated wavelength. So in principle, macroscopic objects should show this kind of wave-particle duality too, given a sensitive enough experiment.
Physicists haven’t yet devised a way to measure the wavelike nature of very large objects, but their ambition in this respect has been steadily increasing. In 1999, they demonstrated the wave-particle duality of fullerene molecules. And other groups have since done the same with even larger molecules.
And that raises the interesting question of how big they can go. Could they, for example, measure the quantum properties of the molecules of life itself?
Today, they get an answer thanks to the work of Armin Shayeghi at the University of Vienna and a few colleagues, who for the first time, have demonstrated quantum interference in molecules of gramicidin, a natural antibiotic made up of 15 amino acids. Their work paves the way for the study of the quantum properties of biomolecules and sets the scene for experiments that exploit the quantum nature of enzymes, DNA, and perhaps one day simple life forms such as viruses.
Shayeghi and co’s experiment is simple in principle. Their approach is to create a beam of ultracold gramicidin molecules and then to measure the interference pattern created when this beam interferes with itself. This interference pattern is then clear evidence of the wavelike nature of the molecules.
That’s easier said than done. The first problem is creating the beam of individual biomolecules, which are particularly fragile and easy to break apart.
Shayeghi and co do this by coating the edge of a spinning wheel with a thin layer of gramicidin. The team then fires a series of short laser pulses at the wheel to knock the gramicidin molecules off the surface. The laser pulses have to be short enough—just a few femtoseconds in length—to kick the biomolecules without damaging them.
The free-floating gramicidin molecules are then swept up in a beam of argon atoms travelling at 600 meters per second. In this beam, the gramicidin has a wavelength of 350 femtometers (1 femtometer is 1x10-15 meters).
The final step is to measure the pattern created by the wave interfering with itself.
This is perhaps the most difficult bit. The wavelength of the beam is about a thousandth that of the biomolecules themselves (as measured by how closely they can pack together). So the team require a technique that can measure patterns on that scale.
That’s where interferometry comes in. The team use an extraordinarily sensitive technique known as Talbot-Lau interferometry to measure the size of the interference pattern.
And the results are persuasive. “The molecular coherence is delocalized over more than 20 times the molecular size,” say Shayeghi and co. This kind of “smearing“ of the biomolecules would be impossible if the gramicidin molecules were pure particles. It is possible only with wavelike interference.
Other researchers have measured wave-particle duality for larger molecules. But they have used techniques that would tear apart the delicate molecules of life. The new technique will allow more detailed study of the quantum properties of biomolecules.
“The successful realization of quantum optics with this polypeptide as a prototypical biomolecule paves the way for quantum assisted molecule metrology and in particular the optical spectroscopy of a large class of biologically relevant molecules,” say the researchers.
That’s interesting research with significant potential to help to tease apart the fabulously complex processes at work in the machinery of life.

These knots aren't quite the same as the ones you might tie to moor a boat to a jetty - they've been made in a superfluid form of quantum matter called Bose-Einstein Condensate, or BEC, and are more like smoke rings than traditional knots.
""For decades, physicists have been theoretically predicting that it should be possible to have knots in quantum fields, but nobody else has been able to make one,"" said lead researcher, Mikko Möttönen. ""Now that we have seen these exotic beasts, we are really excited to study their peculiar properties. Importantly, our discovery connects to a diverse set of research fields including cosmology, fusion power, and quantum computers.""
These knots of BEC, called knotty solitons, form particle-like rings or loops that roll forward at a constant speed without deforming. When the BEC superfluid is first created, it's made up of a series of points in space all having a specific orientation. The trick of the knotting technique is to change that orientation using very precise magnetic fields - so precise, the scientists conducting the experiment were afraid to move at all.
With it so far? Even if the science is difficult to grasp, the end result is simple enough: tiny knots composed of an interlocking series of circles that look a little like smoke rings or doughnuts. These quantum knots are also topologically stable, which means they can't be undone and must be broken instead. If you think about a shoelace analogy, these particular types of shoelaces can't be pulled apart with your fingers, and have to be cut off with scissors instead.
The tying of the knot takes less than a thousandth of a second, according to Möttönen's research partner, David Hall. ""After we learned how to tie the first quantum knot, we have become rather good at it,"" he said. ""Thus far, we have tied several hundred such knots.""
This is high-level, mind-blowing stuff, and it could be a long time before the results trickle through to everyday life. The researchers believe the discovery might one day help inform the development of quantum computers, where qubits could be braided into different types of knots depending on the task at hand.

Quantum radar technology, a remote-sensing method based on quantum entanglement, has so far remained theoretical with experiments only conducted in laboratories. Now, researchers at the University of Waterloo are developing a new approach that could see the technology deployed for the first time outside of a lab.
“This project will allow us to develop the technology to help move quantum radar from the lab to the field,” said Jonathan Baugh, a faculty member at the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) and a professor in the Department of Chemistry. The project is being led by Baugh with three other researchers at IQC and the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology (WIN).
According to the University of Waterloo, if successful, the new technology would “help radar operators cut through heavy background noise and isolate objects — including stealth aircraft and missiles — with unparalleled accuracy.” This may explain why the project has received $2.7 million in funding from Canada's Department of National Defence’s (DND) All Domain Situational Awareness (ADSA) Science & Technology program.
A program with its eyes on the Arctic
According to a statement released by the Government of Canada last October, ASDA “is a new program led by DND, which aims to leverage science & technology expertise from other government departments, academia, industry and allies, to identify, assess and validate technologies in support of air and maritime surveillance, particularly in the North.” The program has received up to $133million in funding for use over the next five years and has been set up to have a particular focus on the Arctic, now that climate change is making the region more accessible.
“In the Arctic, space weather such as geomagnetic storms and solar flares interfere with radar operation and make the effective identification of objects more challenging. By moving from traditional radar to quantum radar, we hope to not only cut through this noise but also to identify objects that have been specifically designed to avoid detection,” said Baugh.
Stealth aircraft are designed to be undetectable by traditional radar through a combination of shape, paint and electronic artificial noise jamming. Researchers believe that quantum radars would be able to detect these specialized planes without even alerting them.

Introducing quantum illumination
“It could change the way we think about national security,” said Baugh. But in order for the project to take off, Baugh and his team first need to succeed in producing pairs of entangled photons on demand, no easy feat.
“The goal for our project is to create a robust source of entangled photons that can be generated at the press of a button,” said Baugh. This is because quantum radar technology is based on a technique called quantum illumination where one photon from a pair is shot out at a distant object while the other stays behind.
Quantum illumination is still very much in its infancy. Time will tell what advancements Baugh's team will bring to the field.

In this case, the word “holographic” indicates a way to simplify physics problems involving both quantum mechanics and gravity, not a literal hologram, so simulations like this could help us understand how to combine those two concepts into a theory of quantum gravity – perhaps the toughest and most important problem in physics right now.
Both quantum mechanics, which governs the very small, and general relativity, which describes gravity and the very large, are extraordinarily successful in their respective realms, but these two fundamental theories do not fit together. This incompatibility is particularly apparent in areas where both theories should apply, such as in and around black holes.
These areas are extraordinarily complicated, and that is where holography comes in. It allows physicists to create a less complex system that is equivalent to the original, similar to how a two-dimensional hologram can show three-dimensional details.

Maria Spiropulu at the California Institute of Technology and her colleagues used Google’s Sycamore quantum computer to simulate a holographic wormhole – a tunnel through space-time with black holes at either end. They simulated a type of wormhole through which a message could theoretically pass, and examined the process by which such a message could make that journey.
In a real wormhole, that journey would be largely mediated by gravity, but the holographic wormhole uses quantum effects as a substitute for gravity to remove relativity from the equation and simplify the system. That means that when the message passes through the wormhole, it is actually undergoing quantum teleportation – a process by which information about quantum states can be sent between two distant but quantum entangled particles. For this simulation, the “message” was a signal containing a quantum state – a qubit in a superposition of both 1 and 0.
“The signal scrambles, it becomes mush, it becomes chaos, and then it gets put back together and appears immaculate on the other side,” says Spiropulu. “Even on this tiny system we could prop up the wormhole and observe just what we expected.” This occurs because of the quantum entanglement between the two black holes, which allows the information falling into one end of the wormhole to be preserved at the other end. That process is part of why a quantum computer is useful for this type of experiment.
The simulation used only nine quantum bits, or qubits, so it was very low-resolution. Like a picture of a bird taken from far away, this had the same general shape as the object it represented, but the simulation had to be carefully adjusted to display the characteristics of a wormhole. “If you want to see this as a wormhole, there are a number of parallels, but it’s definitely a matter of interpretation,” says Adam Brown at Stanford University in California, who was not involved in this work.
Using a more powerful quantum computer could help bring the image into focus. “This is just a baby wormhole, a first step to test the theories of quantum gravity, and as the quantum computers scale up we have to start using bigger quantum systems to try to test the bigger ideas in quantum gravity,” says Spiropulu.
That is crucial because some theories of quantum gravity are difficult or even impossible to completely understand using only classical computing. “We know that quantum gravity is very confusing, the theory can be very hard to extract predictions from, and the dream would be to do something on a quantum computer that tells you things you don’t already know about quantum gravity,” says Brown. “This is not that – this is a very small quantum computer, so everything about it is completely possible to simulate on a laptop without the fan even starting.”
But the simulation’s similarity to a real wormhole hints that it may be possible to use quantum computers to formulate and test ideas about quantum gravity, and maybe eventually to understand it.

History Of D-Wave
D-Wave was created more than a decade ago, when it first developed a 16-qubit prototype. The company unveiled its 28-qubit version publicly for the first time in 2007. Since then, its increased its number of qubits at a steady pace, more than doubling every two years or so.
In 2013, the company announced its 512-qubit computer and a collaboration between Google and NASA, who were going to test various algorithms on it and see how fast it could get compared to conventional computers. Last year, D-Wave announced a 1,000-qubit generation, and now the company is previewing its 2,000-qubit computer, which will likely go on sale next year.
Criticism And Results
D-Wave has been criticized by many quantum computing experts, who, for one, say it’s not a true universal quantum computer (which Google itself and IBM are now building), and second, they don’t believe D-Wave’s “quantum annealing computer” is all that useful compared to standard computers.
A quantum annealing computer is a special-purpose quantum computer, so the difference between it and a universal quantum computer is kind of like the difference between an ASIC and a CPU. In theory, D-Wave’s computer should at least be useful for some optimization problems, where you have many variables and are trying to optimize for the best solution.
Last year, Google announced that its tests show that for quantum annealing tasks, D-Wave’s 1,000-qubit computer proved to be 100 million times faster than a classical computer with a single core:
""We found that for problem instances involving nearly 1,000 binary variables, quantum annealing significantly outperforms its classical counterpart, simulated annealing. It is more than 10^8 times faster than simulated annealing running on a single core,"" said Hartmut Neven, Google's Director of Engineering.
Even if you account for the fact that a D-Wave computer that costs $10 million is more than 10,000 times more expensive than a regular PC, you’re still left with a difference in performance of 10,000 times faster/dollar.
However, Google’s engineers also admitted that, for now, there aren’t too many practical uses for D-Wave’s technology, but that could change with future D-Wave generations.
The 2,000-Qubit D-Wave Computer
One highly exciting aspect of quantum computers of all types is that beyond the seemingly Moore’s Law-like increase in number of qubits every two years, their performance increases much more than just 2x, unlike with regular microprocessors. This is because qubits can hold a value of 0, 1, or a superposition of the two, making quantum systems able to deal with much more complex information.
If D-Wave's 2,000-qubit computer is now 1,000 faster than the previous 1,000-qubit generation (D-Wave 2X), that would mean that, for the things Google tested last year, it should now be 100 billion times faster than a single-core CPU.
The new generation also comes with control features, which allows users to modify how D-Wave’s quantum system works to better optimize their solutions. These control features include the following capabilities:
The ability to tune the rate of annealing of individual qubits to enhance application performanceThe ability to sample the state of the quantum computer during the quantum annealing process to power hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms that were not previously possibleThe ability to combine quantum processing with classical processing to improve the quality of both optimization and sampling results returned from the system.
D-Wave’s CEO, Vern Brownell, also said that D-Wave’s quantum computers could also be used for machine learning task in ways that wouldn’t be possible on classical computers. The company is also training the first generation of programmers to develop applications for D-Wave quantum systems.
More information about the new computer will be unveiled today at D-Wave’s first users conference in in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where representatives from Los Alamos National Laboratory, NASA, Lockheed Martin, the Roswell Park Cancer Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USC, and D-Wave will be speaking.",4349,"['d8628v0', 'd86qp9u', 'd863hn6', 'd866ht1']"

The algorithm, SIKE (short for Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (opens in new tab)), made it through most stages of the US Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) competition that aimed to define standardized, post-quantum algorithms (opens in new tab) against the threat posed by quantum computers - which will render current encryption schemes obsolete.
The researchers approached the problem from a purely mathematical standpoint, attacking the core of the algorithm’s design instead of any potential code vulnerabilities.
For mathematicians, the researchers were able to crunch SIKE by attacking its base encryption math, Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH). They showed (opens in new tab) that SIDH is vulnerable to the “glue-and-split” theorem, developed by mathematician Ernst Kani in 1997, with additional mathematical tools devised in 2000. Still placed squarely in the mathematical arena, the attack uses genus two curves to attack elliptic curves (genus 1 curves). According to SIKE co-inventor David Jao, a professor at the University of Waterloo, “The newly uncovered weakness is clearly a major blow to SIKE” - which it is. But he added that all of this goes back to cryptographers’ sometimes imperfect dominion of pure mathematics, in that the approach taken by the researchers was “really unexpected.”
For the rest of us, all of that means that the researchers used math to understand SIKE’s encryption scheme and could predict - and then retrieve - its encryption keys.
For their troubles and the paper titled An Efficient Key Recovery Attack on SIDH (Preliminary Version) (opens in new tab), the researchers received a Microsoft-sponsored $50,000 bounty (opens in new tab).
SIKE emerged to prominence after making it one of four additional candidates being considered by NIST after the organization last month officially announced the four algorithms that will replace the currently-used RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman algorithms. Most of the globe’s cybersecurity stands on these algorithms, which have been invaluable in securing information against bad actors - when they aren’t compromised by other means. But they have a fundamental issue: they’ll be easily bested once quantum computers scale enough. And that’s not a matter of “if” anymore: it’s a matter of “when.”
“When” is expected to occur within this decade, so there’s a veritable race to harden future computing systems and update the encryption schemes applied to current information.
To put the big problem into perspective, consider this: the current estimation is that humanity will have produced and stored 64 zettabytes (opens in new tab) (1,000 bytes to the seventh power) of data by 2020. Almost none of that information is currently quantum-resistant. But, for now, we’re somewhat insulated from a cascade of quantum-powered hacks by the technology’s complexity - only the most remarkable corporations and prosperous states have the brain, human, and monetary capital for these systems.
But the cost will decrease. Close to “off-the-shelf” solutions will eventually appear. And when they do, any data secured with classical algorithms will have as good a protection as an apple’s skin is at preventing you from sinking your teeth into its core.
Yet it seems that all it takes to break specific leading-edge designs - namely, SIKE - is a single-core computer and an exotic application of high-level math. So it begs the question: are we ready to create standards for such a burgeoning field of computing, where novel approaches and breakthroughs are announced daily?
As Jonathan Katz, an IEEE Member and professor in the department of computer science at the University of Maryland, wrote in an email to Ars Technica, “It is perhaps a bit concerning that this is the second example in the past six months of a scheme that made it to the 3rd round of the NIST review process before being completely broken using a classical algorithm.” Rainbow, the candidate he is referring to, was broken in February this year, although only at a theoretical level. He continued: “Three of the four PQC schemes rely on relatively new assumptions whose exact difficulty is not well understood, so what the latest attack indicates is that we perhaps still need to be cautious/conservative with the standardization process going forward.”
Whether the time is ripe for standardization or not, one thing is certain: intense work in post-quantum cryptography is needed. Just think about the systemic damage a single successful attack on a medium-sized bank - flipping all its information to a zero, for instance - would have on its very human clients and the financial system at large. We’re talking about everything ranging from single-parent families to 401K savings accounts through small and not-so-small companies.

Among the team's hardware and software innovations, perhaps the most eyebrow-raising claim is that they solved a huge problem with very high precision using an exascale supercomputer packing ""up to 40 million heterogeneous sw26010pro cores.""
Specifically, the research team is focused on ""solving the challenging quantum many-body problem."" Without delving into too much detail, the quantum many-body problem embodies both incredible complexity and colossal scale.
Recently researchers have been going down the route of using deep learning-based simulations to tackle these problems, and the Chinese researchers are following this same path. However, they are leveraging up to 40 million compute cores and other innovations in their scientific quest.
What else do we know about the HPC system the researchers wielded during their research and testing? The Sunway Taihulight is currently listed in the HPC Top500 charts as number four in the world rankings. This system, as listed, features 10.6 million sw26010 heterogeneous cores. This isn't the computer the scientists were using, though; they had access to a new next-gen system.
According to the researchers, they are using a ""new Sunway supercomputer,"" and this offers an upgraded processor model dubbed the sw26010pro. This processor features six core groups (CG), each of which is attached to a ring network. Each CG contains one management process element (MPE, control core) and a cluster of 64 computing process elements (CPE, computing core) arranged in an 8 × 8 mesh. This would mean that a single sw26010pro has roughly 6 x 64 cores (384 cores), so the new Sunway supercomputer would require about 104,000 of these processors to hit 40 million cores. This figure tallies with some earlier reports about what we should expect of the next-gen Sunway supercomputer.
The researchers are pitching for the Gordon Bell Prize thanks to their research. This prize is sometimes likened to being a 'Nobel Prize for Supercomputing,' so the researchers have to do more than suggest a bigger hammer to crack a humungous nut. Thus, they discuss many claimed innovations addressing aspects of computing, such as deep convoluted neural network development for quantum many-body problems, algorithm innovations, HPC-AI framework innovations, and others.
Computer software is a major part of any workable solution and ""the software environment has been greatly improved on the new Sunway supercomputer, especially for AI applications,"" according to the researchers.
The importance of solving challenging quantum many-body problems isn't the major prize in itself. If such issues can be tackled in a meaningful way, researchers will gain clarity regarding potentially valuable exotic physical phenomena. In other words, the research detailed above could lead to key insights and developments in quantum spin liquids, high-temperature superconductivity, supersolids, heavy fermions, fractional quantum Hall effects, and more.",3197,"['i5kbxyk', 'i5jthzd', 'i5k9zx1', 'i5jxits', 'i5kj04d', 'i5ksz4k', 'i5ltf76', 'i5mxeap', 'i5n0lrs', 'i5k0v7f', 'i5jt71k', 'i5k90y5', 'i5kn07l', 'i5nbd42']"

The headlines have been incredible. Newsweek (Scientists Have Reversed Time in a Quantum Computer), Discover (Scientists Used IBM’s Quantum Computer to Reverse Time, Possibly Breaking a Law of Physics) and the UK’s Independent newspaper (Scientists ‘Reverse Time’ With Quantum Computer in Breakthrough Study). Cosmopolitan magazine also chimed in: Scientists just turned back time and it’s like Back to the Future is coming true. There are many, many more.
The trigger for all of these was a Scientific Reports paper with the provocative title “Arrow of time and its reversal on the IBM quantum computer.” In it, the authors claimed to have performed an experiment that opens up lines of research, in their words, toward “investigating time reversal and the backward time flow.”
If you had difficulty understanding how scientists accomplished such a counterintuitive feat, don’t worry. They didn’t.
Some simple physical models are symmetric in time. Think of an idealized version of the Earth orbiting the sun, where each is a perfect sphere. Look at that system going forward in time, and the Earth orbits in a clockwise direction. “Reverse” time and instead the Earth will travel in a counterclockwise orbit. Both are equally realistic. Or think of two billiard balls colliding. You can run the video in either direction and it still seems physically plausible.
The real world is not that way. Things look different going forward in time from how they would were time reversed—in a number of different ways, among them that entropy (very loosely speaking, a measure of disorder) increases. This is a law both of physics and of common sense. (For a fun and sad exploration of how strange reversing the flow of time would make things, check out Time’s Arrow by Martin Amis. And if you really want to get into the weeds on the physics of time travel, try here.)
So if they didn’t invent time travel, what did these scientists actually do?
Think about pressing rewind on a video. That “reverses the flow of time,” in a way. If you’ve never seen it before, it’s kind of neat. It might let you see things—like steam flowing back into a tea kettle or Humpty Dumpty spontaneously assembling from a jumble of broken pieces—that appear to “reverse the arrow of time.” The paper in question describes a quantum-computing version of such a video running in reverse.
A closer analogy is a lens, like what one would find in a telescope, a microscope, or eyeglasses. A lens can be used to focus light—“reversing” the dispersal of light that had gone out of focus. The authors of the paper, from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, and ETH Zurich, say their technique might be useful for testing quantum programs. This is correct. But it’s a lot less interesting than a time machine.
As Scott Aaronson, director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas at Austin, says, “If you’re simulating a time-reversible process on your computer, then you can ‘reverse the direction of time’ by simply reversing the direction of your simulation. From a quick look at the paper, I confess that I didn’t understand how this becomes more profound if the simulation is being done on IBM’s quantum computer.”
Other quantum computing experts we spoke to agreed. One, who did not wish to be named, said: “I don’t know how useful this is … it doesn’t mean that these guys made a time machine. They certainly didn’t violate the laws of thermodynamics or the laws of physics.” He added: “This is the type of hype that is going to give quantum computing a bad name.”
He’s right. Wild headlines don’t just give quantum computing a bad name. They do damage to science as a whole by convincing the public that science is so bewildering it’s beyond their comprehension. It’s tough enough to explain the paradoxes that actually exist in quantum mechanics without sensationalist embellishment. Time, whether any of us likes it or not, marches on.
This article was originally published under the headline: ""No, IBM didn’t just 'reverse time' with a quantum computer."" While this is accurate, the headline was modified to reflect the fact that though the researchers in question used publicly-available IBM quantum computing facilities, they are not affiliated with the company.

The general idea is to use the special properties of quantum mechanics to make measurements or produce images that are otherwise impossible.
Much of this work is done with photons. But as far as the electromagnetic spectrum is concerned, the quantum revolution has been a little one-sided. Almost all the advances in quantum computing, cryptography, teleportation, and so on have involved visible or near-visible light.
Today that changes thanks to the work of Shabir Barzanjeh at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and a few colleagues. This team has used entangled microwaves to create the world’s first quantum radar. Their device, which can detect objects at a distance using only a few photons, raises the prospect of stealthy radar systems that emit little detectable electromagnetic radiation.
The device is simple in essence. The researchers create pairs of entangled microwave photons using a superconducting device called a Josephson parametric converter. They beam the first photon, called the signal photon, toward the object of interest and listen for the reflection.
In the meantime, they store the second photon, called the idler photon. When the reflection arrives, it interferes with this idler photon, creating a signature that reveals how far the signal photon has traveled. Voila—quantum radar!
This technique has some important advantages over conventional radar. Ordinary radar works in a similar way but fails at low power levels that involve small numbers of microwave photons. That’s because hot objects in the environment emit microwaves of their own.
In a room temperature environment, this amounts to a background of around 1,000 microwave photons at any instant, and these overwhelm the returning echo. This is why radar systems use powerful transmitters.
Entangled photons overcome this problem. The signal and idler photons are so similar that it is easy to filter out the effects of other photons. So it becomes straightforward to detect the signal photon when it returns.
Of course, entanglement is a fragile property of the quantum world, and the process of reflection destroys it. Nevertheless, the correlation between the signal and idler photons is still strong enough to distinguish them from background noise.
This allows Barzanjeh and co to detect a room temperature object in a room temperature environment with just a handful of photons, in a way that is impossible to do with ordinary photons. “We generate entangled fields using a Josephson parametric converter at millikelvin temperatures to illuminate a room-temperature object at a distance of 1 meter in a proof of principle radar setup,” they say.
The researchers go on to compare their quantum radar with conventional systems operating with similarly low numbers of photons and say it significantly outperforms them, albeit only over relatively short distances.
That’s interesting work revealing the significant potential of quantum radar and a first application of microwave-based entanglement. But it also shows the potential application of quantum illumination more generally.
A big advantage is the low levels of electromagnetic radiation required. “Our experiment shows the potential as a non-invasive scanning method for biomedical applications, e.g., for imaging of human tissues or non-destructive rotational spectroscopy of proteins,” say Barzanjeh and co.
Then there is the obvious application as a stealthy radar that is difficult for adversaries to detect over background noise. The researchers say it could be useful for short-range low-power radar for security applications in closed and populated environments.

The quantum-logic clock, which detects the energy state of a single aluminum ion, keeps time to within a second every 3.7 billion years. The new timekeeper could one day improve GPS or detect the slowing of time predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity.
""It could it be a real contender for the next frequency standard, or next timekeeper,"" said physicist Chin-wen (James) Chou of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, lead author of a study to appear in a forthcoming Physical Review Letters.
Chou's team is one of several racing to build an atomic clock that can replace the current international standard, the cesium fountain clock. The cesium clock loses one second every 100 million years. Chou's is not the first quantum-logic clock, but his uses aluminum and magnesium ions, which makes it twice as precise as its predecessors that used aluminum and beryllium.
To keep time, quantum-logic clocks measure the vibration frequency of UV lasers. Unfortunately, the best lasers we can build veer off their normal frequency by about one tick every hour, Chou said. To keep the laser's timekeeping precise, its vibration must be anchored to something much more stable.
That anchor is the vibration of an electrically charged aluminum atom, which vibrates at 1.1 Petahertz, or 1.1 quadrillion times a second.
The first step in measuring the ion's vibration is to hit it with UV lasers, which are tuned to the charged atom's rate of vibration. The aluminum ion can be in either a low- or high-quantum energy state.
""If the laser frequency is right on the ion frequency, then the ion will change state, but if the laser frequency is off a little bit, then the ion doesn't change state as efficiently,"" Chou said. ""This efficiency is a signal that tells us, this signal is off by so much, and we should steer the frequency so it stays on the frequency of the aluminum ion.""
But they can't tune the laser frequency to the aluminum ion state unless they can actually detect that state. To do that, the group couples the aluminum ion to a magnesium ion. A separate set of laser beams shine on the pair. If the aluminum ion changes state, then both ions start to move.
Detecting that motion requires a third set of lasers to focus on the magnesium ion. If the magnesium ion is in motion, it emits a photon of light. Otherwise, it stays dark.
""That’s the beauty of it, we can see just one ion emitting light,"" Chou said.
In a weird twist, the team can't actually tell how many times the clock ticks per second. That's because the definition of a second is currently based on the cesium fountain clock, which simply can't measure the precision of a more precise machine. It works using a similar principle as the aluminum clock, but uses the vibration of a cesium atom to anchor the frequency of a microwave source.",2945,"['c0k3hur', 'c0k3moc', 'c0k436z', 'c0k3rse', 'c0k45i5', 'c0k3s1z', 'c0k3uh0', 'c0k49fm', 'c0k4b81', 'c0k4cgc', 'c0k4223']"

Researchers from MIT and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory determined that environmental radiation—including beta particles, gamma rays, and X-rays—break apart bonded electrons, which then disrupt qubits. Their study was published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.
“If you look back at the last few years of quantum computing development, it's been improving exponentially,” said Ben Loer, a staff physicist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and a co-author of the study. “All we've done is found one more place where it needs to be improved, but we have plenty of ideas on how to do it.”
The basic unit of information in traditional computing is a bit, which can store a 1 or a 0. Quantum computing derives its power from qubits, basic units of information that have the ability to store two states at once. A main challenge in achieving practical quantum computing is improving coherence, or the length of time that a qubit can retain its quantum state—the longer you leave a qubit, the likelier it is to be disrupted by quasiparticles, which are unpaired electrons.
Radiation can originate on Earth or from outer space. Building materials like concrete and brick emit low levels of radiation, and extraterrestrial nuclei produce cosmic radiation when they interact with Earth’s atmosphere. The research team found that without intervention, cosmic and environmental radiation alone would limit the lifespan of a qubit to a few milliseconds. Qubits today last shorter than a thousandth of a millisecond, so solving the radiation problem is crucial to one day achieving practical quantum computing.
A chance encounter inspired the study when Pacific Northwest National Laboratory nuclear physicist Brent VanDevender needed to borrow equipment for an experiment from William Oliver, a quantum information researcher. In the course of lending the equipment, Oliver mentioned that quantum computing had long been puzzled by greater-than-expected amounts of quasiparticles, adding that environmental radiation was an emerging hypothesis.
“Neutrino physicists and dark matter physicists deal with mitigating the effects of radiation all the time—it's one of the hardest parts of our life,” VanDevender said. “It was really natural for us to work with Will Oliver to test that hypothesis, which is what the paper is about.”
In the paper, the authors also propose and test a solution for the radiation in the form of a lead shield, which is commonly used in nuclear and particle physics. They made a shield from 10-cm-thick lead bricks and placed it around a cryostat that keeps the qubits at a low temperature, finding that it mitigated some of the effects of the radiation.
Implementing the change was straightforward, but it was much more challenging to measure its effect, VanDevender said.
“Building the pile of bricks was easy—they sent in a grad student and he hauled them up—but making the actual measurement that demonstrated that the bricks actually had some effect on the qubit, that was a very subtle, small signal,” he said.
That’s because the qubits produced today can only maintain quantum states for microseconds, so measuring any change in their longevity is a tedious effort.
It might seem obvious in hindsight to some that cosmic radiation caused an excess of quasiparticles observed universally, but Loer and VanDevender said that they were met with pushback when presenting the group’s hypothesis.
“After the fact, when we said, 'We've demonstrated that radiation is a source of excess quasiparticles,' everyone said, 'Well yeah, that's obvious,'” Loer said. “But those same people six months earlier—it hadn’t seemed to occur to anybody.”
This may have been because some of the materials they used were commonplace to nuclear physics but not readily available to a quantum information researcher, VanDevender said. For example, he has lead bricks “all over” his nuclear physics lab, but someone who studies qubits would have no reason to stock them, let alone know where to find them.
VanDevender said that future work is in order to determine how each form of radiation affects quasiparticle formation, though the group hypothesizes that each type will have its own, unique effect. There’s also the theoretical question of how high-energy radiation somehow breaks very cold electron pairs into quasiparticles.
Not only can the group’s findings help make better quantum computers; the applications of this research come full circle to inform VanDevender’s and Loer’s physics research.
“As it turns out, the same physics which makes radiation a nuisance for qubits means that something like them should be very good detectors,” VanDevender said. “For Ben and me, searching for dark matter or really rare neutrino interactions, we're sure there are detector technologies to be added that will extend our discovery reach.”",5064,"['g3ckfba', 'g3clzgs', 'g3dtgws', 'g3f0xu1', 'g3cay4d', 'g3ckfba', 'g3clzgs', 'g3dtgws', 'g3f0xu1', 'g3cay4d']"

Safari's fine, Microsoft Edge is whatever, I think Opera still exists? None have ever offered much reason to switch away from Chrome, Google's fast, simple web tool. I'm not the only one who feels this way, either: Chrome commands nearly 60 percent of the browser market, and is more than four times as popular as the second-place finisher, Firefox. Chrome won the browser wars.
So my expectations for Firefox Quantum, the new browser from Mozilla, were not particularly high. Mozilla made big promises about Quantum's speed and efficiency, which are what everyone makes big promises about when they launch a new browser, and they never really make a difference in the experience. Sure, a couple dozen Chrome tabs can bring even the beefiest computer hardware grinding to a beach-balling halt, but Chrome does the job. What could Firefox even do to win me over?
It turns out there are lots of things Firefox Quantum could do to improve the browser experience, and it did many of those things. The new Firefox actually manages to evolve the entire browser experience, recognizing the multi-device, ultra-mobile lives we all lead and building a browser that plays along. It's a browser built with privacy in mind, automatically stopping invisible trackers and making your history available to you and no one else. It's better than Chrome, faster than Chrome, smarter than Chrome. It's my new go-to browser.
The speed thing is real, by the way. Mozilla did a lot of engineering work to allow its browser to take advantage of all the multi-core processing power on modern devices, and it shows. Every page seems to load one beat sooner than I expect, which makes the whole browsing experience that much more efficient. It's not life-changingly different, and I can't say I notice the 100 percent advantage Mozilla swears it has over Chrome, but it definitely feels zippier. I definitely notice Firefox's better memory usage; I routinely find myself with 30 or 40 tabs open while I'm researching a story, and at that point Chrome effectively drags my computer into quicksand. So far, I haven't been able to slow Firefox Quantum down at all, no matter how many tabs I use.
Again, though, speed and memory aren't enough to merit the hassle of switching browsers (even if they should be). Rather, it's the little things, the things you do with and around the web pages themselves, that make Firefox really work. For instance: If you're looking at a page on your phone and want to load that same page on your laptop, you just tap ""Send to Device,"" pick your laptop, and it opens and loads in the background as if it had always been there. You can save pages to a reading list, or to the great read-it-later service Pocket (which Mozilla owns), both with a single tap. Pocket also surfaces a bunch of articles you might like when you open a new tab, which is a delightful way to bring actual browsing back to the browser.
Quantum feels like a bunch of power users got together and built a browser that fixed all the little things that annoyed them about other browsers. It has a QR code reader built in. It has a menu item for copying a URL, and if you've ever tried to copy and paste a long URL on your phone you know how nice that is. Firefox even makes screenshots more intuitive: it can capture a section, everything on your screen, or the entire webpage all at once. You can even turn on ""Night Mode"" and invert the colors on most blindingly white websites. All these things are so fiddly in other browsers, requiring bookmarklets and extensions to work. Firefox just put them all in the browser.",3656,"['dqbpa80', 'dqc2uss', 'dqbpg35', 'dqbu5qh', 'dqbqfpa', 'dqc9nxm', 'dqbsdqn', 'dqcl6nd', 'dqcv081']"

Led by Caltech, a collaboration between Fermilab, AT&T, Harvard University, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the University of Calgary reports the successful teleportation of qubits, basic units of quantum information, across 22 kilometers of fiber in two testbeds: the Caltech Quantum Network and the Fermilab Quantum Network.
“The team has been working persistently and keeping our heads down in the past few years,” said Maria Spiropulu, a particle physicist at Caltech who directs the INQNET research program and co-authored the new paper, in an email.
Though the collaboration knew it had “achieved significant results” by the spring of 2020, Spiropulu added, they refrained from sharing the news, even informally on social media, until the publication of the full study this week.
“We wanted to push the envelope for this type of research and take important steps on a path to realize both real-life applications for quantum communications and networks and test fundamental physics ideas,” said Panagiotis Spentzouris, head of the Quantum Science Program at Fermilab, in an email.
“So, when we finally did it, the team was elated, very proud for achieving these high-quality, record-breaking results,” he continued. “And we are very excited that we can move to the next phase, utilizing the know-how and the technologies from this work towards the deployment of quantum networks.”
The researchers say their experiment used ""off-the-shelf"" equipment that is compatible with both existing telecommunications infrastructure and emerging quantum technologies. The results “provide a realistic foundation for a high-fidelity quantum Internet with practical devices,” according to a study released on Tuesday in the journal PRX Quantum report.
Quantum teleportation does not involve the actual transfer of matter. Rather, quantum particles are entangled (dependent on each other, even over long distances) and somehow know the property of their other half. From our explainer earlier this year:
In a way, entangled particles behave as if they are aware of how the other particle is behaving. Quantum particles, at any point, are in a quantum state of probabilities, where properties like position, momentum, and spin of the particle are not precisely determined until there is some measurement. For entangled particles, the quantum state of each depends on the quantum state of the other; if one particle is measured and changes state, for example, the other particle’s state will change accordingly.
The study aimed to teleport the state of quantum qubits, or ""quantum bits,"" which are the basic units of quantum computing. According to the study, the researchers set up what is basically a compact network with three nodes: Alice, Charlie, and Bob. In this experiment, Alice sends a qubit to Charlie. Bob has an entangled pair of qubits, and also sends one qubit to Charlie, where it interferes with Alice's qubit. Charlie projects Alice's qubit onto an entangled quantum Bell State that transfers the state of Alice's original qubit to Bob's remaining qubit.
The breakthrough is notable for a few reasons. Many previous demonstrations of quantum teleportation have proven to be unstable over long distances. For example, in 2016, researchers at the University of Calgary were able to perform quantum teleportation at a distance of six kilometers. This was the world record at the time and was seen as a major achievement.
The ultimate goal is to create quantum networks that would use entanglement and superposition to vastly increase computing speed, power, and security, relative to classical computers. For example, the U.S. Department of Energy has an ambitious plan to build a quantum network between its National Laboratories.
Any field that relies on computers would be affected by the realization of this technology, though much of the focus of the future potential of quantum networks revolves around cryptography, search algorithms, financial services, and quantum simulations that could model complex phenomena.
Quantum computing has been on the horizon for years, and this study takes us one step closer to realizing it on a practical scale. But don’t expect to surf a quantum internet anytime soon.
“People on social media are asking if they should sign up for a quantum internet provider (jokingly of course),” Spiropulu said. “We need (a lot) more R&D work.”
Now that Fermilab, Caltech, and its partners have demonstrated this key step toward these networks, the team plans to further develop quantum information technology by building a metropolitan-scale network, called the Illinois Express Quantum Network, around Chicago.
“There are many fronts that we need to push forward,” said Spentzouris, “both in applications of quantum communication and network technologies and in advancing the engineering of the systems. We are already working hard on developing architecture, processes, and protocols for quantum networks and on optimizing along some metrics including rate of communications and range.”",5306,"['gg5uskz', 'gg5pa85', 'gg7b7n7', 'gg6s0fe']"
