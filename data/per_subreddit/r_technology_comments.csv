To represent the state of an n-qubit system on a classical computer would require the storage of 2^n complex coefficients. That would mean 2^300 complex coefficients on a classical computer. Up until now, scientists have been finding it really hard to create large quantum bit configurations. (where large is more than 16 or so) Let it also be known that general purpose quantum decryption has a time complexity of O( 2^n/2 ) where n is keylength in bits. This is half the degree of general purpose normal decryption, which is awesome, but all you have to do is double the keylength for all your encryption.

Since time does not pass for a photon, as it is travelling at the speed of light, it exists for a fleeting moment, in fact, no time at all. It has a starting point where it is created and it has a finishing point, where its energy is converted back into some other form.

From the photon's point of view, where its finishing point is, will depend on its starting state and the state of the universe. But that is the state of the universe over the time the photon exists (to us) and not for the time the photon exists to it (zero time).

So I am wondering, does the photon have a view of the state of the universe outside of time as we see it? Time moves forwards to us, but does the photon see all time as a single snapshot, like a room where all states exist at the same time? Do the slits just form a part of the timeless view that the photon has, and it just decides, based on that view of the universe where it is going to end up? It does not actually travel there - it just works out through a probability function *where* it needs to be in its view of the universe, and then its energy is simply taken there in an instant (but ""where"" to it is ""where and when"" to us)?

This would be like in the early 1900s Ford coming out with its Model T with a top speed of 45 mph and claiming that cars had now achieved speed supremacy over horses.  Then the next year somebody finds a horse that can run at 50 mph--technically winning back the crown of 'supremacy'.

But it's an empty victory--anybody with a brain knows that cars are going to keep getting faster and horses aren't.

Quantum computers are exponentially faster than classical computers for the limited set of problems which are within the quantum complexity class--but quantum computers are difficult to build.

Now that multiple companies are building them (and showing that they achieve speedup over classical computers on certain problems) then it's clear that the two are going to separate exponentially over time (on those problems).

Temporarily winning back the throne of 'supremacy' via a herculean effort on a classical computer is the equivalent of scouring the planet for a horse that can sprint at 50 mph. At best it's a footnote.

Abstract: 

> Quantum computers can be used to address electronic-structure problems and problems in materials science and condensed matter physics that can be formulated as interacting fermionic problems, problems which stretch the limits of existing high-performance computers1. Finding exact solutions to such problems numerically has a computational cost that scales exponentially with the size of the system, and Monte Carlo methods are unsuitable owing to the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made solving even few-atom electronic-structure problems interesting for implementation using medium-sized quantum computers. Yet experimental implementations have so far been restricted to molecules involving only hydrogen and helium2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Here we demonstrate the experimental optimization of Hamiltonian problems with up to six qubits and more than one hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground-state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. We achieve this result by using a variational quantum eigenvalue solver (eigensolver) with efficiently prepared trial states that are tailored specifically to the interactions that are available in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians9 and a robust stochastic optimization routine10. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying it to a problem of quantum magnetism, an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in an external magnetic field. In all cases, we find agreement between our experiments and numerical simulations using a model of the device with noise. Our results help to elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems and for bridging the gap between key problems in high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.",0,70n7g5,[]

Abstract

> Majorana zero-modes—a type of localized quasiparticle—hold great promise for topological quantum computing1. Tunnelling spectroscopy in electrical transport is the primary tool for identifying the presence of Majorana zero-modes, for instance as a zero-bias peak in differential conductance2. The height of the Majorana zero-bias peak is predicted to be quantized at the universal conductance value of 2e2/h at zero temperature3 (where e is the charge of an electron and h is the Planck constant), as a direct consequence of the famous Majorana symmetry in which a particle is its own antiparticle. The Majorana symmetry protects the quantization against disorder, interactions and variations in the tunnel coupling3,4,5. Previous experiments6, however, have mostly shown zero-bias peaks much smaller than 2e2/h, with a recent observation7 of a peak height close to 2e2/h. Here we report a quantized conductance plateau at 2e2/h in the zero-bias conductance measured in indium antimonide semiconductor nanowires covered with an aluminium superconducting shell. The height of our zero-bias peak remains constant despite changing parameters such as the magnetic field and tunnel coupling, indicating that it is a quantized conductance plateau. We distinguish this quantized Majorana peak from possible non-Majorana origins by investigating its robustness to electric and magnetic fields as well as its temperature dependence. The observation of a quantized conductance plateau strongly supports the existence of Majorana zero-modes in the system, consequently paving the way for future braiding experiments that could lead to topological quantum computing.",0,88i4vl,[]

671,e9svt3n,9xe3ic,1542351135.0,pyalot,r/technology,"They claim to send out two beams of photons which are entangled, and if one of the beam hits something (like an aircraft) detect the change in the other beam.

This claim violates the [quantum no-communication theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem). It states that measurement of an entangled quantum state cannot convey information from one observer to another.

A discussion of this effect is often mired in discussions of faster than light. However this is a red herring, because quantum entanglement has no ""speed"". It cannot ever be anything other than instant.

Therefore if China actually managed to violate the no-communication theorem, using it for a kind of radar would be one of the the least exciting applications, because they could use it for instantaneous communication across any distance. This would allow for a variety of world-changing applications such as:

- Extremely fast supercomputers which communicate trough entangled states and therefore have no signal lag to deal with to exchange information between ""cores"".
- Extremely cheap and fast communication ""networks"" because no lines, signals, or other form of connection is needed
- Spacecraft that can be any distance away yet can be communicated with instantly, obviating the need for complex autonomous/preprogrammed control sequences as well as allowing data exchange across interstellar/intergalactic distances
- Makes it possible to have a closely connected interstellar civilization

Anybody posessing such technology could practically rule the world. For instance:

- No other network carrier can compete with a quantum entangled network because of speed and cost. The discovery would overnight render every existing telecom operator obsolete.
- Anybody operating in financial markets at the speed of ""instant"" rather than just boring old speed of light would enjoy an enormous global advantage as they can obtain and act on information hundreds of milliseconds faster than anybody elses algorithms.
- If you could actually keep realtime contact to a space-probe, sending one to another star as soon as possible going as fast as possible would probably be one of sciences most foremost objectives right now.",0,9xe3ic,[]

For those of you who are a bit confused as to why a 50 bit computer is important: The most I can simplify a quantum vs regular digital computer is that digital pc's use bits 0 or 1 representing information. Sometimes it can even be a bottleneck because of the distance of your PC components. But these bits are the foundation of digitally represented logic. Switching from electric current to however qubits store info: (Just 1s and 0s? -1, 0, 1, a tuple for each qubit representing position and info stored?) will be a very good thing for computer science. So many people are already excited about them that I think once personal qubit PCs come out we'll start to see a large change in how CS is taught and it could lead to some great breakthroughs. Faster CPUs, new architecture, more complex operations taking 1 clock tick, etc...

For those of you who are a bit confused as to why a 50 bit computer is important: The most I can simplify a quantum vs regular digital computer is that digital pc's use bits 0 or 1 representing information. Sometimes it can even be a bottleneck because of the distance of your PC components. But these bits are the foundation of digitally represented logic. Switching from electric current to however qubits store info: (Just 1s and 0s? -1, 0, 1, a tuple for each qubit representing position and info stored?) will be a very good thing for computer science. So many people are already excited about them that I think once personal qubit PCs come out we'll start to see a large change in how CS is taught and it could lead to some great breakthroughs. Faster CPUs, new architecture, more complex operations taking 1 clock tick, etc...


**Tl;Dr** IBM did an impressive thing that has the potential to both change how we use and teach computers. But more importantly, it could allow for new approaches to unsolved computer theory problems and who knows what the quantum properties of these qubits will let us do?",0,7c22ez,[]

This would allow many electronics to be replaced with photonics, greatly reducing their size and making devices even smaller. Computers would be defined less by gross switches, and more by it's laser elements that would shoot the computer together.

921,it1zs7i,y8unmi,1666264065.0,OUReddit2,r/technology,"From the post:

“A team of physicists say they managed to create a new phase of matter by shooting laser pulses reading out the Fibonacci sequence to a quantum computer in Colorado. The matter phase relies on a quirk of the Fibonacci sequence to remain in a quantum state for longer.

Just as ordinary matter can be in a solid, liquid, gas, or superheated plasmic phase (or state), quantum materials also have phases. The phase refers to how the matter is structured on an atomic level—the arrangement of its atoms or its electrons, for example. Several years ago, physicists discovered a quantum supersolid, and last year, a team confirmed the existence of quantum spin liquids, a long-suspected phase of quantum matter, in a simulator. The recent team thinks they’ve discovered another new phase.

Quantum bits, or qubits, are like ordinary computer bits in that their values can be 0 or 1, but they can also be 0 or 1 simultaneously, a state of ambiguity that allows the computers to consider many possible solutions to a problem much faster than an ordinary computer. Quantum computers should eventually be able to solve problems that classical computer can’t.

Qubits are often atoms; in the recent case, the researchers used 10 ytterbium ions, which were controlled by electric fields and manipulated using laser pulses. When multiple qubits’ states can be described in relation to one another, the qubits are considered entangled. Quantum entanglement is a delicate agreement between multiple qubits in a system, and the agreement is dissolved the moment any one of those bits’ values is certain. At that moment, the system decoheres, and the quantum operation falls apart.

A big challenge of quantum computing is maintaining the quantum state of qubits. The slightest fluctuations in temperature, vibrations, or electromagnetic fields can cause the supersensitive qubits to decohere and their calculations to fall apart. Since the longer the qubits stay quantum, the more you can get done, making computers’ quantum states persist for as long as possible is a crucial step for the field.

In the recent research, pulsing a laser periodically at the 10 ytterbium qubits kept them in a quantum state—meaning entangled—for 1.5 seconds. But when the researchers pulsed the lasers in the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence, they found that the qubits on the edge of the system remained in a quantum state for about 5.5 seconds, the entire length of the experiment (the qubits could have remained in a quantum state for longer, but the team ended the experiment at the 5.5-second mark). Their research was published this summer in Nature.

You can think of the Fibonacci sequence laser pulses as two frequencies that never overlap. That makes the pulses a quasicrystal: a pattern that has order, but no periodicity.

“The key result in my mind was showing the difference between these two different ways to engineer these quantum states and how one was better at protecting it from errors than the other,” said study co-author Justin Bohnet, a quantum engineer at Quantinuum, the company whose computer was used in the recent experiment.

The Fibonacci sequence is a numeric pattern in which each number is the sum of the two previous numbers (so 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). Its history goes back over 2,000 years and is connected to the so-called golden ratio. Now, the unique series may have quantum implications.

“It turns out that if you engineer laser pulses in the correct way, your quantum system can have symmetries that come from time translation,” said Philipp Dumitrescu, the paper’s lead author and a quantum physicist who conducted the work while at the Flatiron Institute. A time-translation symmetry means that an experiment will yield the same result, regardless of whether it takes place today, tomorrow, or 100 years from now.

“What we realized is that by using quasi-periodic sequences based on the Fibonacci pattern, you can have the system behave as if there are two distinct directions of time,” Dumitrescu added.

Shooting the qubits with laser pulses with a periodic (a simple A-B-A-B) pattern didn’t prolong the system’s quantum state. But by pulsing the laser in a Fibonacci sequence (A-AB-ABA-ABAAB, and so on), the researchers gave the qubits a non-repeating, or quasi-periodic, pattern.

It’s similar to the quasicrystals from the Trinity nuclear test site, but instead of being a three-dimensional quasicrystal, the physicists made a quasicrystal in time. In both cases, symmetries that exist at higher dimensions can be projected in a lower dimension, like the tessellated patterns in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling.

“With this quasi-periodic sequence, there’s a complicated evolution that cancels out all the errors that live on the edge,” Dumitrescu said in a Simons Foundation release. By on the edge, he’s referring to the qubits farthest from the center of their configuration at any one time. “Because of that, the edge stays quantum-mechanically coherent much, much longer than you’d expect.” The Fibonacci-pattern laser pulses made the edge qubits more robust.

More robust, longer-lived quantum systems are a vital need for the future of quantum computing. If it takes shooting qubits with a very specific mathematical rhythm of laser pulses to keep a quantum computer in an entangled state, then physicists had better start blasting.”",0,y8unmi,[]

> Comments A team of physicists say they managed to create a new phase of matter by shooting laser pulses reading out the Fibonacci sequence to a quantum computer in Colorado.

> Several years ago, physicists discovered a quantum supersolid, and last year, a team confirmed the existence of quantum spin liquids, a long-suspected phase of quantum matter, in a simulator.

> &quot;The key result in my mind was showing the difference between these two different ways to engineer these quantum states and how one was better at protecting it from errors than the other,&quot; said study co-author Justin Bohnet, a quantum engineer at Quantinuum, the company whose computer was used in the recent experiment.

Abstract: 

> Quantum computers can be used to address electronic-structure problems and problems in materials science and condensed matter physics that can be formulated as interacting fermionic problems, problems which stretch the limits of existing high-performance computers1. Finding exact solutions to such problems numerically has a computational cost that scales exponentially with the size of the system, and Monte Carlo methods are unsuitable owing to the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made solving even few-atom electronic-structure problems interesting for implementation using medium-sized quantum computers. Yet experimental implementations have so far been restricted to molecules involving only hydrogen and helium2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Here we demonstrate the experimental optimization of Hamiltonian problems with up to six qubits and more than one hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground-state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. We achieve this result by using a variational quantum eigenvalue solver (eigensolver) with efficiently prepared trial states that are tailored specifically to the interactions that are available in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians9 and a robust stochastic optimization routine10. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying it to a problem of quantum magnetism, an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in an external magnetic field. In all cases, we find agreement between our experiments and numerical simulations using a model of the device with noise. Our results help to elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems and for bridging the gap between key problems in high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.",0,70n7g5,[]

Of course- I asked if I could see it, but because of the parties involved (military) I would require a high level military clearance (he did say about 25 people have actually seen it).

Since time does not pass for a photon, as it is travelling at the speed of light, it exists for a fleeting moment, in fact, no time at all. It has a starting point where it is created and it has a finishing point, where its energy is converted back into some other form.

From the photon's point of view, where its finishing point is, will depend on its starting state and the state of the universe. But that is the state of the universe over the time the photon exists (to us) and not for the time the photon exists to it (zero time).

So I am wondering, does the photon have a view of the state of the universe outside of time as we see it? Time moves forwards to us, but does the photon see all time as a single snapshot, like a room where all states exist at the same time? Do the slits just form a part of the timeless view that the photon has, and it just decides, based on that view of the universe where it is going to end up? It does not actually travel there - it just works out through a probability function *where* it needs to be in its view of the universe, and then its energy is simply taken there in an instant (but ""where"" to it is ""where and when"" to us)?

The video brought up a few concepts without really elaborating what they mean in terms of computing. So I'll try my best here to explain.

In a normal computer, a bit can either be 0 or 1. Using superposition, a quantum bit (or qubit) can be 0, 1 or both. This allows for more than 2 states per bit, allowing you to fit more information in a smaller space. Someone claimed that it allows up to 8 different states, but I'm skeptical about that.

About entanglement. Normally, whether one bit is 0 or 1 doesn't affect any of the other bits, not without some sort of higher layer logic which of course slows the whole thing down. But it can with quantum entanglement. The ability for a bit to affect other bits allows something called nondeterminism. All computers right now are deterministic computers, meaning that one state that it is in leads to exactly one other state. This means that it can only think about a single possibility and a single outcome at a time, so to speak. With quantum entanglement, it is possible for one state to lead to many other states simultaneously, which solves problems much faster than normal because it can think about many possibilities and outcomes at the same time. The main benefit here is the ability to solve problems with NP complexity really fast. NP problems are problems that are really hard for a computer to solve. The video gave the Travelling Salesman Problem as an example of one: trying to minimize the cost of traveling to every city.

Not quite sure about quantum tunneling though. I haven't heard or read anything about that yet in terms of computing.",0,1of2pe,[]

Birds are very good at this, easy to train, and you can set up a self-reinforcing system by having three birds decide for each picture. Whenever there is a disagreement, you go with the majority, and reward the majority with a treat. That provides enough reinforcement to keep the recognition accurate.

You can even train new birds automatically, by having a system where they are paired with a group of already trained birds, and they are rewarded when they agree with the trained group.

B.F. Skinner did a successful demonstration during WWII of how pigeons could be trained to recognize ships and identify them as ours or the enemy's, and could be used to steer guided bombs to the enemy ships.

There was some work after the war into using pigeons to inspect parts on assembly lines. The birds were far more accurate than humans, as humans get tired and have trouble paying attention after hours of watching the same part come by. The birds worked all day, and their accuracy didn't fall off.

Ultimately, the tests were stopped, because the companies that participated thought the public would not understand. They feared the competitors would try to make it sound like using dumb birds to inspect the parts, instead of highly trained humans, meant low quality.

Still, its kind of funny to realize that Google could probably do a better job of automatically classifying things, such as uploaded images, by setting up a bird-based system. I wonder what PETA would think of it?

1672,ceo99al,1v2hpa,1389590467.0,TheStevenator,r/technology,"I've attended a lecture by one Matthias Troyer from ETH who did fairly conclusive testing of this system.


[Here is an earlier presentation](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/fs2013/troyer_matthias_quantumannealing.pdf), (the one I saw was more current, in that linked presentation he compares against a GPU system, (similar compute topology to large-core-count Intel sever CPU's) instead).


The D-Wave computer solves ONE and only ONE type of problem topology: the [Ising Spin Glass Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model#Spin_Glasses). Dr. Troyer analyzed the computer statistically against 3 topolgies:


- Simulated Quantum Annealing
- Simulated Classical Annealing
- One other that I can't remember (don't have notes with me).


The D-Wave system correlated HIGHLY against the simulated quantum annealing and quite low with the other two topologies.  In my opinion, this is sufficient evidence, for now, to establish its credibility as a legitimately new system, and to validate their claims about HOW it operates.


What does NOT match up, however, are their claims about performance speedup. Dr. Troyer, using a server Intel CPU, (8 Core Xeon, with HT enabled) with optimized code, ran a speed test against various topologies of the Ising spin glass problem itself. He found that, with respect to wall-clock time, that not only does the D-Wave chip underperform in the small set size regime, but that, in the large set size regime, (something that you would use this 1000-qubit processor for), it scales almost identically to the Intel hardware, which is obviously, a small fraction of the cost of the D-Wave One/Two/whatever. In fact, there are certain problem topologies that it straight up can not solve within a reasonable time limit, (it is a heuristic solver, so that was almost expected), that the Intel CPU can, (though it takes substantially longer to do so than you would think).

TL;DR - IS  a quantum annealer: inherently limited to one type of computation. Performs like shit anyways. Don't buy one unless you want to pump money into the ASIC fabrication supply chain, relating specifically to materials used for qubit systems, (pretty sure that's the only reason Google, etc are selling this so hard).

EDIT: 8 Core Xeon w/ HT. 

EDIT 2: My post may sound rather incriminating of D-Wave. IMO All of these efforts are useful, the modern CMOS architectures were not built in a day, or even a decade. However, D-Wave has been..... not careful.... when marketing itself, or allowing itself to be reported in the press. For years articles about its machines were mostly incoherent pieces of technobabble with nonsense claims. I think that kind of lackadaisical promotion is dangerous because it sows distrust.",0,1v2hpa,[]

Matthias Troyer's team (http://www.itp.phys.ethz.ch/people/troyer) has written code that runs on a good old classical GPU and that outperforms the D-Wave machine.  The D-Wave machine is still a few orders of magnitude slower than that lowly GPU code.

Also, it is not clear how useful the types of optimization the DWave CPU  really are -- it is certainly not capable of universal quantum computation, i.e., can't run Shor's algorithm (not that that is very useful for much).

“Quantum computing, a form of high-speed calculation at the subatomic level conducted at extraordinarily cold temperatures, will bring computers to speeds barely imaginable today.” Once again, speed is not the issue here. Quantum computing, once fully achieved, would allow you to enact algorithms that let you do certain things, like finding prime factors of a very large number, which would be unachievable with a classical computer in a reasonable amount of time. So it’s the ability to do something you couldn’t realistically do before, not the speeding up of current processes. (Also side note not all forms of quantum computer require low temperatures, mainly just superconducting qubits)

China is no farther than the U.S. with achieving a fault tolerant quantum computer that can enact impactful algorithms. To be honest, neither is very close at all.

I think I saw one other person mention that computers operate completely based on logic gates.. I don't think I saw anyone else mention that computing is still based on eletromagnetism.

There is no sorcery going on here that makes the quibit 1 and 0 at the same time. The bit is simply held in a neutral state until the computer needs it to be a 1 or a 0, instead of functioning like a switch that is either on or off like a transistor.

What does this mean for computing? Exponential calculations will be far easier, but classical computing will largely not change, nor can it change.

Most if not all of our logic gates rely on a bit being set to either 1 or a 0, and we have millions and millions of them, versus a handful of quibits.

This is quantum encryption. Not true ""quantum communication"" like something via quantum entanglement. Best case scenario is more security but the same speed as before. Worst case is slower speeds due to some extra computational overhead. 

For those more interested this seems pretty mixed for covering the three goals of data security. It should provide very good confidentiality for the time being (a way to break the encryption will be discovered, mark my words). Integrity is a mixed bag since there is always the issue with quantum wave forms collapsing where you MAY not get what was intended (how ever small a chance it may be). Then we have availability. It provides VERY poor availability. Instead of a threat actor needing to establish a large network of bots to initiate a ddos or similar attack, one must simply try to read the communication to end it. A simple slave dish directed at the satellites could end all outbound quantum communication by simply observing the packets. That's bad (unless another mechanism I'm not aware of is in place to prevent this scenario).

Then we have one other issue.... That's the personal. Any one working in security fields knows that users screwing up (intentionally or not) is probably our biggest risk right next to improper implementation and configuration (think equifax or the iCloud hacks from a while back). One time quantum pads will help, but only so much. We'll see.

The problem is simple, the more signal you have the less well it works until you simply can't get the signal through.

People seem to completely fail to grasp that there are different definitions to the word ""quantum"" and communication by it has NOTHING to do with computing with it.

Our data is 1's and 0's and converting it all to random 0.387's and 9.elephant's isn't going to make it any faster.   If all the data has to be processed repeatedly and re-sent from both ends several times to deal with errors it is much simpler just to use binary and checksum.

After the first confirmed extrasolar planet was proven, other planet hunters went back through their data using the new findings and discovered to their chagrin that they, in fact, had found identical data on numerous ES planets beforehand but simply didn't apply the proper imagination to know what they were seeing.

I'm probably screwing this up, but I seem to remember most planet hunters were looking for planets like Jupiter in our own solar system...massive planets a decent distance from their home star that would make the star's wobble fairly easy to detect.  However, the first planet confirmed (and, bizarrely compared to ""accepted wisdom"" of solar system formation at the time) was indeed incredibly large but was far closer to its host star than even Mercury is to our own.

It may well be that when the question is finally answered as to the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations...and don't forget that's really what we're looking for.  We may well find extraterrestrial life in our own solar system (such as in the vast, ancient oceans of Europa, etc.) but it's advanced life, like our own species that can create a civilization that can even be detected, period, we're really looking for.

It may well be that when the \*\*first\*\* truly verifiable, traceable, reproducible extra terrestrial civilization is discovered, what we learn from it may well show us many more we had already found and just didn't realize them for what they were because they weren't what we were initially expecting.",0,vumwlv,[]

2121,ifesu8g,vumwlv,1657323756.0,nucflashevent,r/technology,"Whenever I read about new ways to communicate (which is to say new ways we might detect an ET Civilization) I'm reminded of the initial search for extra-solar planets in the 90s.  After the first confirmed extrasolar planet was proven, other planet hunters went back through their data using the new findings and discovered to their chagrin that they, in fact, had found identical data on numerous ES planets beforehand but simply didn't apply the proper imagination to know what they were seeing.

I'm probably screwing this up, but I seem to remember most planet hunters were looking for planets like Jupiter in our own solar system...massive planets a decent distance from their home star that would make the star's wobble fairly easy to detect.  However, the first planet confirmed (and, bizarrely compared to ""accepted wisdom"" of solar system formation at the time) was indeed incredibly large but was far closer to its host star than even Mercury is to our own.

It may well be that when the question is finally answered as to the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations...and don't forget that's really what we're looking for.  We may well find extraterrestrial life in our own solar system (such as in the vast, ancient oceans of Europa, etc.) but it's advanced life, like our own species that can create a civilization that can even be detected, period, we're really looking for.

It may well be that when the \*\*first\*\* truly verifiable, traceable, reproducible extra terrestrial civilization is discovered, what we learn from it may well show us many more we had already found and just didn't realize them for what they were because they weren't what we were initially expecting.",0,vumwlv,[]

I don't know the science at all, but from what I understand it's essentially two particles are somehow locked on to each other and match each other's states, so when one particle's state is altered, the other shifts to match that state. It can be as far away or have as much signal blocking as you want between them and their states will still match.

2285,h54pswn,ojr4kr,1626248054.0,lionhart280,r/technology,"Okay so let me break down a few reasons why no one reading this needs to worry anytime ever about their stuff being cracked by a quantum computer.

1. Quantum Computers need a Superconductor to work, and not just any Superconductor, but one locked into a finite state and stabilized.

2. Currently to do this we have to basically cool the material down to very very very close to absolute zero. **If we ever figure out a way to achieve this at more reasonable temperatures, Quantum Computers aren't the only thing this tech applies to.** Most of human life as we know it would fundamentally change if we can figure out a way to lock in super conductors at reasonable temps (and this isnt just being a super conductor, its a **stable** super conductor)

3. This process takes **several days** to perform, for *one* calculation. You heard me. And 99% of that time is that whole ""cooling it down to almost absolute zero"" part I mentioned above, as well as trial and error. See what happens is they cool it down annnd... nope it failed, try again. Repeat several times til it locks in right. Even if you get it on the first try, it will take easily 1-2 days for *one* calc. And there's not much we can do to speed it up because its literally just sitting around waiting for it to get cold.

4. And to **keep** it that cold so it works, the thing needs to sit in a giant room with multiple layers of protection, cooling, heat sinks, you name it. A single Quantum Computer unit takes up an entire room, and it needs to be a Clean Room, everyone in suits.

5. And by the way, the cost to have a couple engineers run the thing, all the cooling liquid, the mountains of electricity, the equipment... Each calculation costs a small fortune to simply just run it.

6. Modern encryption algorithms would require a QPU several billion times more powerful than what we have right now. And if we just bump up the tier of encryption people use on basic stuff one tick, just a ever so slight bump of the knob up, it becomes several billion *times* more of a requirement yet again. You go from needing a couple billion qubits to a couple billion *billion* qubits, with just a nudge of encryption tier up, just like that.

So for perspective now:

Imagine if it took several days and fifty thousand dollars to hack **one** encrypted item, like, **one** email, *and* that email has to use an *extremely* outdated form of encryption from like, 20+ years ago. And we have millions and millions of qubits to work with (as opposed to the, what are we at, like 200 now on the most advanced QPU? Did we hit 400 yet?)

Then I mean yep, you can do that, sure hope that email was worth the 50K it cost to crack.

And I mean, hey, if its like, super critical information conferred between some politician and someone else 20 years ago that matters now... Maybe it could be.

But no one is gonna drop 50K on cracking your portable hard drive full of ~~porn~~ ""family photos""",0,ojr4kr,[]

It's the understanding of why that makes theoretical projections realistic - as they don't here, I'm a bit skeptical and not entirely confident in the projections.

Many groups have been working on such approaches for years now. 

The new aspect is that this group proposes a neural network architecture that explicitly incorporates the fundamental antisymmetry of the many-electron wave function (as demanded by the Pauli principle). Non-network ansätze have been incorporating that since the birth of quantum mechanics, but how to best implement it in a network-based wave function such that it does not spoil the desired efficiency improvements of such an ansatz is active research.

After the first confirmed extrasolar planet was proven, other planet hunters went back through their data using the new findings and discovered to their chagrin that they, in fact, had found identical data on numerous ES planets beforehand but simply didn't apply the proper imagination to know what they were seeing.

I'm probably screwing this up, but I seem to remember most planet hunters were looking for planets like Jupiter in our own solar system...massive planets a decent distance from their home star that would make the star's wobble fairly easy to detect.  However, the first planet confirmed (and, bizarrely compared to ""accepted wisdom"" of solar system formation at the time) was indeed incredibly large but was far closer to its host star than even Mercury is to our own.

It may well be that when the question is finally answered as to the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations...and don't forget that's really what we're looking for.  We may well find extraterrestrial life in our own solar system (such as in the vast, ancient oceans of Europa, etc.) but it's advanced life, like our own species that can create a civilization that can even be detected, period, we're really looking for.

It may well be that when the \*\*first\*\* truly verifiable, traceable, reproducible extra terrestrial civilization is discovered, what we learn from it may well show us many more we had already found and just didn't realize them for what they were because they weren't what we were initially expecting.",0,vumwlv,[]

After the first confirmed extrasolar planet was proven, other planet hunters went back through their data using the new findings and discovered to their chagrin that they, in fact, had found identical data on numerous ES planets beforehand but simply didn't apply the proper imagination to know what they were seeing.

I'm probably screwing this up, but I seem to remember most planet hunters were looking for planets like Jupiter in our own solar system...massive planets a decent distance from their home star that would make the star's wobble fairly easy to detect.  However, the first planet confirmed (and, bizarrely compared to ""accepted wisdom"" of solar system formation at the time) was indeed incredibly large but was far closer to its host star than even Mercury is to our own.

It may well be that when the question is finally answered as to the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations...and don't forget that's really what we're looking for.  We may well find extraterrestrial life in our own solar system (such as in the vast, ancient oceans of Europa, etc.) but it's advanced life, like our own species that can create a civilization that can even be detected, period, we're really looking for.

It may well be that when the \*\*first\*\* truly verifiable, traceable, reproducible extra terrestrial civilization is discovered, what we learn from it may well show us many more we had already found and just didn't realize them for what they were because they weren't what we were initially expecting.",0,vumwlv,[]

The fraud part comes from the constant implication that they are making progress, that they are having ""Hello, world"" moments.

Which isn't surprising, since D-Wave have been so rubbish at communicating in anything but hyperbole...shooting themselves in the foot even though they seem to have actually achieved something impressive!

D-Wave have been going on about this sort of thing for quite a while, but there was heavy scepticism because they basically seemed to be claiming to have solved all (massive) outstanding problems in quantum computing, but wouldn't really tell anyone how or do proper demonstrations.

It now seems to be emerging that *can* make machines that *probably* do use quantum effects to solve a *particular class* of problems. That's great, and the class of problems includes many useful real life ones. But it probably *isn't* a quantum computer in the sense that everyone else in the field ever uses the term - that is, it's not a general calculation device using qubits. That isn't necessarily a problem, it may be able to solve problems in its class faster than a classical computer and even algorithmically faster than is classically possible. But it doesn't mean it's a general purpose machine that could possibly replace (say) your CPU right now. They and many others are probably working towards the more general case, and they've probably made important breakthroughs on the way, but it doesn't sound like they're actually there yet.

Since they really do seem to be producing useful machines and have recently produced some more convincing evidence of quantum effects, it will be very interesting to see where this leads, but be very wary of taking these kinds of articles at face value.

------

> It’s a big win for D-Wave, said Rose, who has battled skeptics who questioned the legitimacy of his quantum technology — a technology he noted no other company is working on today.

This kind of thing is vaguely annoying - the initial scepticism was heavily justified, and shouldn't be whitewashed away by them eventually properly proving a level of success. Also, I'd be willing to bet that *many* companies (and governments...) are working on this kind of technology, though the field focuses on the more general quantum computer concept. Perhaps nobody is publicly working on exactly the same sort of machine...

Whenever there is something that needs to load like a new tab or a video or literally anything it will slowly lag a little bit here and then a little bit in the next site and all this lag snowballs and makes the whole experience bad ,at least for me. Chrome is unfortunately smoother and its ad ons are working unlike firefox's who constantly need to be updated on each version. They also took their sweet time to update their multi thread support and are now behind on literally everything compared to chrome. I don't know why anyone would want firefox except for its better reading features.",0,7fgohy,[]
