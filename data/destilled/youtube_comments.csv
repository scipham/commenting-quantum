Edit: Just found time to watch this amazing science communicator return to the RI (this time without his wife).


The talk has forever changed the way I think about quantum mechanics and the universe. A very memorable talk that tempts me into buying his new book  ""Something Deeply Hidden"". 


I thought it was such a bold move by Prof. Carroll; to take these quantum mechanical ""interpretations"" and make them 'theories'. Its exactly what this field of science needs right now. Creating new theories based from entanglement and getting people to stop using classical mechanics as a starting point would forever change physics.

A superposition does not behave like a probabilistic sum (trace class operator). But we don't observe this behaviour macroscopically. We have to explain how the superposition (before measurement) ends up in the state of a trace class operator (after measurement - branching in many worlds) with or without the environment and the observer. The Schr√∂dinger equation can not do that. A superposition (pure state) always stays a pure state for the Schr√∂dinger equation. But we observe something different.

Instead of using that high-level explanation start peeling back the layers of abstraction and you'll quickly find our well tested mathematical and scientifically based models give way to nothing more than unscientific and unfalsifiable 'interpretations'. It's similar to how people take for granted, or at least express a level of comfort, with the idea that anti-matter and matter annihilate when they come in contact.

It's as long as you got full A+, they don't care what subject it is. And i think what NOOB SHINOBI meant is that he/she cares more about the subject (science and math is really interesting) rather than the grades.

Now, I've read your reply and I think it's valid but it's not the same for SHINOBI as he/she lives in a third world country, a different place than most first world country where you got a lot more freedom and options. In a third world country, corruption is everywhere, teachers are shtty and they don't care about you, they only care about your grades. The teachers don't even know what they are gonna teach (this is based on my experience, my teacher literally walked into class and say he forgot math and say he will learn about it later at home. I mean, he's literally a math teacher, how come he forgot it? Also, most of the teacher in a third world country is just a bunch of people that failed to chase their dreams. Got degree but don't get their dream job so they opt for being teachers. So yeah, in a third world country, teachers are really shtty, it's just a bunch of failed adults who failed their dreams and a bunch of government money eating principals. Unless you live in the main city, the most advanced city in your country, you will have a bad time.).

I too believe that school should be a place for individuals to reach their dreams, not just a place to get good grades to show off to others. I mean, what's the point of learning a knowledge if it's only for showing off? 

I really don't like people that thinks good grades means you're smart and bad grades means you're not smart. It's just shows how narrow your view on life is. Knowledge can't be measured accurately, you can only know if someone is really smart once you talked to them. 

Heck, I'm a strong believer that you don't need teachers or going to school to be smart!! I don't go to school yet I kinda invent many things! You can teach yourself and learn everything by yourself! Just look at my history, hahaha!

The Ricci tensor will vanish while the Riemann tensor can be nonzero as well. The components of the affine connection (Christoffel coefficients) can be given by partial differentiation. The usual notion of 'gravitational force' disappears in general relativity, replaced instead by the idea that freely falling bodies follow geodesics in spacetime. Given a spacetime metric gab and a set of spacetime coordinates xa, geodesic trajectories are given by the equation as where œÑ is a proper time as measured by an observer travelling along the geodesic. Dirac equation is relativistic and proves the existence of antimatter. 

The Klein‚ÄìGordon equation with mass parameter is... Perturbation theories and quantum fluctuations. 

Solutions of the equation are complex-valued functions; the Laplacian acts on the space variables only.

The equation is often abbreviated as

where Œº = mc/ƒß, and ‚ñ° is the d'Alembert operator. The Dirac equation relativistic spectrum is, however, easily recovered if the orbital-momentum quantum number l is replaced by total angular-momentum quantum number j. In January 1926, Schr√∂dinger submitted for publication instead his equation, a non-relativistic approximation that predicts the Bohr energy levels of hydrogen without fine structure.

Consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE.

The diameter of WHAT IS THE MOON is about one quarter of that of what is THE EARTH. On balance, the density of what is the Sun is believed to be about one quarter of that of what is THE EARTH. Excellent. Consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. The TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky is CLEARLY (and fully) consistent WITH what is E=MC2. WHAT IS THE EARTH/ground is fully consistent WITH what is E=MC2. CLEAR water comes from what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Notice what is the fully illuminated (AND setting/WHITE) MOON¬†AND¬†what is the orange (AND setting) Sun. They are the SAME SIZE as what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Lava IS orange, AND it is even blood red. Yellow is the hottest color of lava. The hottest flame color is blue. What is E=MC2 is dimensionally consistent. WHAT IS E=MC2 is consistent with TIME AND what is gravity. What is gravity is, ON BALANCE, an INTERACTION that cannot be shielded or blocked.

Consider what are the tides. The human body has about the same density as water. Lava is about three times as dense as water. The bulk density of WHAT IS THE MOON¬†IS¬†comparable to that of (volcanic) basaltic lavas on what is THE EARTH/ground. Pure water is half as dense as packed sand/wet packed sand. Now, the gravitational force of WHAT IS THE SUN upon WHAT IS THE MOON is about twice that of THE EARTH. Accordingly, ON BALANCE, the crust of the far side of what is the Moon is about twice as thick as the crust of the near side of what is the Moon. The maria (lunar ‚Äúseas‚Äù) occupy one third of the visible near side of what is the Moon. The surface gravity of the Moon is about one sixth of that of what is THE EARTH/ground. The lunar surface is chiefly composed of pumice. The land surface area of what is the Earth is 29 percent. This is exactly between (ON BALANCE) one third AND one quarter. Finally, notice that the density of what is the Sun is believed to be about one quarter of that of what is THE EARTH. One half times one third is one sixth. One fourth times two thirds is one sixth.

Every nutjob on here who vomits up a wall of text on every scientific video, like that tinfoil Frank above (he‚Äôs everywhere, and it‚Äôs hilarious to me he signs with his name like anything he said is truly revolutionary and wants to make sure he‚Äôs credited üòÜ), makes the same mistakes. They badly misunderstand, twist, or straight up ignore very basic concepts in order to gush about whatever myopic conspiracy theory they‚Äôve been obsessed with. It is amusing to me that, regardless of whether or not I agree with it, someone who clearly has an agenda tries to shoehorn ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù  ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù, and ‚Äúmyopic‚Äù ‚Äúonto those who are strict adherents to the scientific method. Being a hardcore proponent of the classical scientific method may be tenuous for real, valid reasons, but if there‚Äôs one thing they aren‚Äôt, it‚Äôs ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù and definitely don‚Äôt adhere to it for ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù or ‚Äúmyopic‚Äù reasons (even if high level research on a smaller scale on really any topic eventually becomes increasingly ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù in scope).

Another mistake usually made by these people is a lack of understanding of more recent literature and research. There is already a concept of ‚Äúuniversal consciousness‚Äù (not in the sense of higher order human consciousness but in a more definitive, minimalistic manner, i.e. certain slime molds) that is viewed as an appropriate, acceptable scientific hypothesis. Even quantum physics itself is fundamentally reliant on the concept of ‚Äúaction at a distance‚Äù, something that used to be associated with superstitious, pseudoscientific, and religious principles. One extra fun fact, the concept of the ‚Äúmultiverse‚Äù, which you seem to deride, doesn‚Äôt actually conflict with what you‚Äôre trying to say.

A statistical impossibility is defined as *_‚Äúa probability that is so low as to not be worthy of mentioning. Sometimes it is quoted as 1/10^50 although the cutoff is inherently arbitrary. Although not truly impossible the probability is low enough so as to not bear mention in a Rational, Reasonable argument.""_* The probability of finding one particular atom out of all of the atoms in the universe has been estimated to be 1/10^80. The probability of a functional 150 amino acid protein chain forming by chance is 1/10^164. It has been calculated that the probability of DNA forming by chance is 1/10^119,000. The probability of random chance protein-protein linkages in a cell is 1/10^79,000,000,000. Based on just these three cellular components, it would be far more *Rational and Reasonable* to conclude that the cell was not formed by undirected random natural processes. Note: Abiogenesis Hypothesis posits that un-directed random natural processes, i.e. random chance formation, of molecules led to living organisms. Natural selection has no effect on individual atoms and molecules on the micro scale in a prebiotic environment. (*For reference, peptides/proteins can vary in size from 3 amino acid chains to 34,000 amino acid chains. Some scientists consider 300-400 amino acid protein chains to be the average size. There are 42,000,000 protein molecules in just one (1) simple cell, each protein requiring precise assembly. There are approx. 30,000,000,000,000 cells in the human body.) Furthermore, of all the physical laws and constants, just the Cosmological Constant alone is tuned to a level of 1/10^120; not to mention the fine-tuning of the Mass-Energy distribution of early universe which is 1/ 10^10^123. Therefore, in the fine-tuning argument, it would be more *Rational and Reasonable* to conclude that the multi-verse is not the correct answer while trying to determine the origin of the universe. 

A ""Miracle"" is considered to be an event with a probability of occurrence of 1/10^6. Abiogenesis, RNA World Hypothesis, and Multiverse would all far, far, far exceed any ""Miracle"". Yet, these extremely *Irrational and Unreasonable* hypotheses are what many of the world‚Äôs top scientists _‚Äòmust‚Äô_ believe in and promote because of a prior commitment to a strictly arbitrary, subjective, biased, narrow, limiting, materialistic ideology / worldview. 

Every idea, number, concept, thought, theory, mathematical equation, abstraction, qualia, Information, etc. existing within and expressed by anyone is ""Immaterial"" or ""Non-material"". The very idea or concept of ""Materialism"" is an immaterial entity and by it's own definition does not exist. Modern science seems to be stuck in archaic, subjective, biased ideologies that have inadequately attempted to define the ""nature of reality"" or the ""reality of nature"" for millenia. A Paradigm Shift in ‚ÄòScience‚Äô is needed for humanity to advance. A major part of this Science Paradigm Shift would be the formal acknowledgment by the scientific community of the existence of ""Immaterial"" or ""Non-material"" entities as verified and confirmed by discoveries in Quantum Physics.",1,UgzTkztO66zssDLdNc14AaABAg,[]

I personally would find it very interesting to begin taking some of the formal language of abstract algebra to make more computationally friendly forms of image processing for example. Who knows, we might gain some awesome intuition on perception along the way :)

As an example of bringing theoretical physics (though more electromagnetic in nature) to the practical (and in a similar vein of perception): the abilities for optical computing are becoming a reality.

They would help tremendously with parallalization of computation for example. 

Metamaterials (materials engineered to have special properties at specific wavelengths) as building blocks for this operational space are a promising future. Their limitations are beginning to be understood as we attempt to implement them. And where they fall short is making us rethink quite a bit!

A quick example, the concept of a gain material was very great for the theorists to make some really cool devices that used all types of symmetries like Parity-Time for use in orbital angular moment control, but experimentalists have found such a style of metamaterial to not respond in the expected hopes of the theorist.

Oh man, on top of all that, synthesizing these materials is its own fun problem and speaks to other interesting questions! But I'm not here to give a lecture and am definitely not qualified to do so.

We can go a level deeper if we like and include the fun of entangled photons for example. Or we use other tricks for improved coherency/sensitivity of a sensor. 

Or heck, five levels deeper there is probably stuff around many body physics. I'm not well-read enough to make any guesses, sorry.

The shorter statement of my belabored example giving above is this:
It's entirely up to you where your heart tells you the right mix of abstract amd practical is.

If your goal is to study particle physics purely because you think that is where the most foundational physics is currently, then as another commentor pointed out, you have been misguided.

While it may seem important to go to the 'deepest level,' please remember that deepest level (for theoretical particle physics at least) is from the perspective of finding foundational building blocks/symmetries. The allure of this assumption is once you have the Lego pieces, you can just build up everything else that you might need. Every question of 'why' must be answered then! Yay! Now just comes the details of combining things in the right way.

Well, if you prescribe to this philosophy (and I certainly don't) I'd still argue that the 'details' are the most interesting side of it. As with my five second example of metamaterials. Sure, the Lagranian of the standard model is beautiful but going to a less abstract form back to something like Maxwell's equations, we can already see life-changing things pop out (see metamaterials use in holography or cloaking devices).

I take forever to get to the point apparently.
Don't do particle physics if you think that's what you need to understand everything else. (See my comment on why the earth's magnetic field flips is due to the tennis racket theorem, just look at your inertia tensor). Do read into it to grasp the main concepts and allow them to change your perspective on how to approach problems you might face in geophysics.

As the other commentor said. There is more money in geophysics. Money is definitely not everything, but not worrying about if you can afford rent frees you to take on problems of more interest to you. You also get to travel to some neat places.",1,Ugy4E5IRp4we-TYDWM14AaABAg,[]

I'm personally very hyped for DUNE experiments surrounding neutrinos! I will admit that these types of big boy experiments like LIGO seem like a one-and-done style of tool to me as well. Yes, experiments flux and alter over time and they are adding all sorts of fun additions... however I cannot stop and think if just because they have a hammer (that did a phenomenal job) that everything looks like a nail.

One really fascinating topic you mentioned is toward the realm of signal processing.

(The big bang) . All things do exist at the same time but are not observable  to us , because of our  current position in space and the limits of our biology. Our realities are in-fact different from one another, but it is beyond our capability  to perceive or comprehend those differences.  Our space- time is like a pinhole camera and because of our biology we can only observe what we can perceive in that limited spectrum. Just like you can't imagine a color you haven't ever saw or a sound you have never  heard so it is with  these alternate realities.  Because we share the same space-time (location) and have the same biology (range of  our senses) we live the same relative reality. Example- Now take an atomic clock to the moon which has been paired with an earth clock and leave it there for 5 years, then retrieve it, you would  find  they are more than a half second off- due to time dilation. Yes even time is relative to our shared location and biology.  As an ordinary person you would not even acknowledge a 1/2 second over 5 years. Bottom line- if it is out of  humans ability to measure with a filter (biology) and unavailable due to  our location (space-time) all alternative  realities, dimensional or not, remain smoky  possibilities.",0,,[]

It‚Äôs Irrelevant! Because unless you have another instantaneous information device to tell you exactly what stage the other electron is in, you would be forced to look at the electron that you have. 

So a thousand years may go by, and you may never check it. Or let‚Äôs say that you check it 1000 years before the other one gets looked at. What does it matter? 

You will never know what the state of the other is in unless you look at your own electron. Lol .

Lol. It‚Äôs personal stuff... but my point is that I am interested in how they use this new Technology to communicate. 

As a Computer engineer, it‚Äôs 70% Physics. So I had to study quantum physics, quantum engineering theory, and at the time of my degree, the hype was in fiber optics. 

People thought that you could send information at light speed. In theory you can. The problem there is that you must have an electronic device to count your on and of states of light. This means that fiber optics and lightspeed was limited to electrical engineering limits. This would in turn cause engineers to create fiber optic cables where the light actually moved a little slower than normal speed of light, just so that the packets could be counted. So imagine light shinning though clear plastic that slows it down. Fiber optics sort of works like that, even though light travels at a constant speed. Anyways, this is my head, my sort of thinking.

When I first hear about using entanglement for instantaneous communication, my first thought was that, they would need to use some sort of quantum mechanics mathematical equations that I myself could not understand. I just know that quantum mechanics is all based on probability and that sort of thing. Because entanglement theory only uses two states that cannot be changed. It‚Äôs all about probabilities. 

Also, the information cannot span long distances, and if it could then you would run into the problems I was talking about. But long distance entanglement is based on theoretical mini black holes in all of this other theoretical Nonsence really. But if you could, would it really be long distance instantaneous information sharing? Yes it would be, but with huge limitations. 

Those limitations would also be present in shot distances. This was my first thought when I heard about these new microchips, or whatever you want to call them. 

I thought... well if they figure out a way to use entanglement for instant communication, it will be greatly limited. They can only do certain special functions with it. 

Then I study when they can do, and I was exactly right. It‚Äôs limited and there is nothing they can do to get around it. It reminds me of the Limitations of fiber optics. Sounds great in theory, but very limited... it‚Äôs the reason I brought it up fiber optics into this conversation. 

I mean what can they do with it? Really? 

I know what they mean. They must create a data link, and that‚Äôs it! A one state data link. Then the chip or pathway must be reset. Because once the state is determined, it‚Äôs used up. Must restart the data again, or reset the chip so to speak. 

Ok, then what? What sort of equation could they come up with on the sending or receiving end? And would the sending or receiving end also need another form of Communication? Probably!. 

So they would need to links of data. It‚Äôs still probably a hellaciously fast way to send data. But in the end, how would all of this work? 

Would they use light speed as the second form of data transfer? If there a way to mingle fiber optics, electrical engineering, and entanglement to benefit together? I assume yes. But I imagine that it‚Äôs incredibly complicated, so much so that it‚Äôs nearly pointless. I think it will be a dead end Technology.",1,UgzVqO1z-EoMUe0m-l94AaABAg,[]

It would be as useful as telling someone that you either did or did not put a unique object like the Mona Lisa on a spaceship. If the Mona Lisa is observed on Earth after the ship has been sent to the Andromeda galaxy, then it's obvious that the Mona Lisa isn't on the spaceship, and vice versa.

However, as far as I know, the current theory is that you _can_ change the state of the photon and then the entangled photon will change its state as well, and if this is the case, then it is highly useful for long distance communication.


Due to confusions with different explanations and misunderstanding explanators, I am not sure which of these two is true. But considering the fact that scientists are actually using entangled photons to communicate and amazing inventions are being experimented on, I have taken an educated guess that it must be the theory that makes entangled photons actually useful instead of the one that makes them useless.",1,UgzVqO1z-EoMUe0m-l94AaABAg,[]

I will try and explain what I mean. 

If your guy in the other galaxy looks at his and its a wave, and you look at yours and its a proton, what's it matter? 

As soon as you look at it, you know the state of the other, I get that! But not you or the other guy will know until you look at it. 

So assuming you look at yours, its a proton. You know both states. But you have no way of knowing if the other guy looked at his. All you really know is that if he does it will be in a wave state. 

Your so far apart that communication, other then the ""state"" is not possible.... so what does this mean?

It means that there might as well only be one particle or wave, because the other wont matter! there is no practical way to make it useful whatsoever. You cannot change the state! 

You could live to be a billion years old, and have a friend in another galaxy, but you wont ever be able to actually communicate with him in all that time even if you could send him instantaneous states. 

it would be the same for me if I lived 100 years and had no friend and only one state! 

There is not way to get around it! And that's exactly my point. Entanglement cannot be used to communicate!  All you would know is the state of the other when you looked at it!",1,UgzVqO1z-EoMUe0m-l94AaABAg,[]

If the only information that can travel faster then light is entangled photons, you might as well only have one! Because there is no other way to display what state its in unless you look at it. If looking at a photon tells you the state of the other that's in another galaxy, its information would be completely irrelevant.

It would be exactly like only having one photon. Because it would take a million light years to communicate to the other guy just to see if he ever looked at it! The fact is you would never know if he did. The only thing that you would know for a fact is the state of your photon. the other may never even came to be witnessed. lol 

its quite literally as useful as having just one photon and cannot be any other way.

QM has many unexplained properties, that particles are 0-dimensional points, yet have properties such as spin, charge, and mass, described only as mathematically but not physically.

Keep in mind that ""Negative Probability"" or ""Imaginary Probability"" is not a real thing, it's just a convenient way of differentiating value in math. What we care about are the actual percentage and the property that you can't combine Imaginary Probability and Positive Probability into a single quantity.

Just like a hybrid approach to the human brain makes us who and what we are, a hybrid approach to computing will make a more interesting AI. 

For more information on how accurate we need to be to creating a digital twin or uploading, see the books:
How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed Ray Kurzweil
Connectome: How the Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are by Sebastian Seung.

Great video -  really like this quote: ‚ÄúIn the future, the sensible approach for quantum simulators as they develop and mature is to use them alongside these classical techniques in a kind of hybrid approach.  A bit like how we already use CPUs and GPUs in our in our normal computers.  
The real potential for quantum simulators is to solve those problems where the approximate techniques fail this would be in problems where even a small error in calculating the energy levels of a molecule or an atom leads to big errors in say the rate of a chemical reaction.‚Äù

‚ÄúA digital twin is a digital replica of a living or non-living physical entity. Digital twin refers to a digital replica of potential and actual physical assets, processes, people, places, systems and devices that can be used for various purposes.‚Äù ‚Äì Google

By 2026, a human digital twin avatar can be created of you by scanning you digital footprint (social media, texts) to be able to match your responses >95% of the time.
Your co-workers, friends and family will not be able to tell the difference of this communication >90% of the time.  (see https://www.soulmachines.com/)

I think a quantum computer could even be developed using frequencies from laser having a slight variance of frequency and combining them with other known variant frequency obtaining a frequency which could be of several different quanta of output. You would not have to make a processor at such a low temperature, and I believe that a consistent output of, lack of better word, quanta of frequency at room temperature.",0,,[]

One, Pretty sure there are a few other methods of creating what you would call quantum computing. A process that can take a photon, electron, etc input and output say four, six, eight statistically consistent outputs could be used as a computer. One example would be a petri dish of virus. Importantly you would need to know a method of consistantly providing the input and being able to understand the output. I do not think anyone would be able to make sense of the output and derive a programming language for the output is of 1677216 variables for a single variable input.
Two, The programmer is another handicap in creating logical output that would create an accurate representation of an actual outcome. Taking 2 x 2 and creating output of 4 is easy to represent in code and semiconductors. For example, taking a database of a billion 2;s and combining that with another database of a billion 2's for an outcome would be a nightmare for any programmer and then the end user is still not able to evaluate if the outcome is correct.",0,,[]

The CPU will still have SIMD processors but far fewer furthermore they might will use up compute time for the CPU so instead you pass to the GPU so the CPU can continue as normal.  I think we shouldn't forget that GPU's used to be video cards so that CPU's passed off information off to the Video Card to pass through hardware based algorithms.  It's when games started to have a lot of physics we decided to put that into the the Video card and call it a GPU instead of putting into the CPU, mainly because if people needed the extra video processing power they probably also needed the extra physics processing power.  Also modern CPU's do now include discrete video cards (called GPU's because SIMD of the CPU is placed in there now).

The reason these are often correlated is because when you increase the pressure of something, you are adding energy to the system which heats it up. But if you keep that thing at a higher pressure for a while it will gradually loose that heat energy to the environment and then be the same temperature as whatever it is in contact with.

So the heat in the Earth's core isn't caused by the pressure, but by some combination of residual heat from when it formed and a load of radioactivity. The pressure is a result of gravity.",1,Ugypz0Kft0mrJ8u2FXh4AaABAg,[]

In other words, it is not derived from first principles. As such, it is not as fundamental in nature as it comes out in this interview, even though of course it is a very big achievement in itself. Work by physicist T. Heimburg at the Niels Bohr Institute has shown that ions can permeate through a membrane even in the absence of membrane receptors. Which is pretty wild when the fundamental assumption of the Hodgkin-Huxley model is that receptors take the central roles of membrane gates.

What is the probability that something important and universal is being overlooked? One number in mathematics that, to me, does not get enough attention is the number, 2. Before jumping off into many worlds, I think, one must pass muster at two worlds. Time is the realm of dualism. Is there a counterpart of the Universe that is being omitted at our peril? Are two-verses implicit in reality, yet overlooked? What I think imaginary math expresses is despite the violation of logic, -1 x -1 = -1 ^2 is true math, but we do not know why.

Yet, applications of imaginary math enabled the finding of the positron, the development of quantum mechanics, developing and manipulating alternating current, and many more legitimate uses. So here are my questions: Since the legitimacy of using imaginary numbers is now well established, should we not explore more deeply why a minus times a minus is a minus? Isn't it true that the universe we recognize may have a counterpart? Should not it be likely that minus one in the realm of the counterpart universe be plus one, and a brand new, vast, realm then opens up for us to grow into? Quantum entities seem to me to be tailor-made to exist in a two-part universe. Gravity may not remain so mysterious, if we know what is its counterpart. Dark (invisible) matter may become visible, and maybe there is a counterpart to entanglement which, when known, will make a lot more sense than it does now.",0,,[]

If I then introduce a wall with some slits notched in it between the gun and target then shoot a large number of electrons inaccurately then it makes sense they would create a similar pattern as a wave would because the instrument wasn't accurate to begin with plus the slits would create dead zones on the target where it would be almost impossible for the electrons to strike, basically what the demonstration showed around 8:00.

For example that the light photon as it moves through space and time, every X Distance or X amount of time, the original photon ""Dies"" but at exact same instant duplicates or Readmits a duplicate photon with exact same ""Information"" and we are not realizing it.  What we see on other side of the Slit is simply the last ""transformation rebirth"" ""dot"" from this process, this ghost of particle ""Rain"" so to speak. So this would mean that light is not ""forever"" but a Self-Re-Propagating Re-emergence popping in and out of existence but for lack of a better word from our existence ""instantly""  and this effect has fluctuations that while the ""information"" is preserved the ""ghost"" Great great great times  500 to the power of whatever Grandchild that makes it to our eye or detector, is simply the final messenger that was ""pushed around"" by the Quantum fluctuations of its very existence.

In addition this would be able to explain Entangled photons for example - that as we catch one photons motion the mirror (think of one in our observation blinking into existence) while the ""other"" is blinking out of existence both ""instantly"" like a fine woven DNA helix of re-propagating information, again we don't realize this is what is going on because light as it is ""created"" is ""instantly at light speed"" there is no zero to light speed curve it just ""is"" from our point of view, even if it is a picosecond,   so these waves of reincarnated (so to speak) photons to us appear to be spooky - but all along have been in a dance that is not perfect and can be disrupted but never the less is not losing any ""real world"" experience of our reality - the MOON still looks like the Moon - not a Photo Copy corruption of it.

Real quantum mechanics is concerned with the development of particles to each other in terms of levels of material reality. Entanglement apparently demonstrates that entangled particles can communicate over distance without any form of material connection at any level - ie through empty space. So quantum theory attempts to discover how relationships between particle entities actually express some form of intentionality.

He (Ralf) was simply assuming and mistaking that what I wrote was my actual general knowledge or level of intelligence and information of the matter but I wrote what I wrote in a specific way to get someone to respond to something nobody has yet.  The point was the majority of people don't even know what instruments were used in the experiment or how the instruments were set up relative to each other, the conditions it was done in etc. Also you can and will actually get what would look like an interference pattern shooting ballistics through slits one at a time depending on the position of the instrument firing the ballistic in relation to the slits, the trajectory the ballistics would follow depending on the angle it's fired from, the distance of the barrier containing slits from the instrument firing and the final target, the accuracy of the instrument firing etc.  There are so many variables.  I actually have a small video which demonstrates it if you care to see it. 

I'm not denying quantum mechanics in any way, shape or form it's been the main study of my adult life but more was trying to point out that most people that think they get and understand what the double slit experiment was and the interpretations derived from it mean don't genuinely actually understand it at all.  I put out comments in a very simple way that comes across as an average person that has just stumbled into the subject to hopefully get the correct response to open a dialogue but it never happens... The problem is with peoples interpretation concerning the physical meaning of the wave function.  

I put forth a time-symmetric interpretation of quantum mechanics that does not stem from the wave properties of the particle. Rather it posits corpuscular properties along with nonlocal properties, all of which are deterministic. This change of perspective points to deterministic properties in the Heisenberg picture as primitive instead of the wave function, which remains an ensemble property. This way, within a double-slit experiment, the particle goes only through one of the slits. In addition, a nonlocal property originating from the other distant slit has been affected through the Heisenberg equations of motion. Under the assumption of nonlocality, uncertainty turns out to be crucial to preserve causality. Hence, a qualitative uncertainty principle can be derived rather than assumed.

The question of the meaning of the wave function is central to many controversies concerning the interpretation of quantum mechanics. I adopt neither the standard ontic nor the epistemic approaches to the meaning of the wave function. Rather, I consider the wave function to represent an ensemble property as opposed to a property of an individual system. This approach resonates with the ensemble interpretation of the wave function that was initiated by Born and further developed by Ballentine. According to this interpretation, the wave function is a statistical description of a hypothetical ensemble, from which the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics stems directly. It does not apply to individual systems. Ballentine justified an adherence to this interpretation by observing that it overcomes the measurement problem by not pretending to describe individual systems, it avoids having to account for state reduction (collapse). I concur with the conclusion by Ballentine but do not concur with his reasoning. Instead, I contend that the wave function is appropriate as an ontology for an ensemble rather than an ontology for an individual system. My principle justification for this is because the wave function can only be directly verified at the ensemble level. By ‚Äúdirectly verified‚Äù I mean measured to an arbitrary accuracy in an arbitrarily short time excluding practical and relativistic constraints.",1,UgxqK9np4z5NvQspGip4AaABAg,[]

As I interpret your points, the deep understanding of the ‚Äòthing‚Äô is not a pre-requisite for a person to conceptualise it in abstract thought. Rather; you can conceptualise the ‚Äòthing‚Äô and apply equally abstract thought using more intuitive methods. 

It is clear you agree that Mathematics is the best tool kit we have to deploy in order to model new concepts and quantify the unknown but serves no purpose for pure creation. 

Mathematics is something we use to discover things but in doings so we put constraints on the discovery.

Maybe. But space or space-time (depending how Newtonian or Einsteinian you dare to be when approaching quantum mechanics) is by default the ""field of fields"" and particles are nothing but fluctuations (obeying very specific mathematical laws, hence ""quantum"" and not ""whatever"") of fields that exist in space(-time). Rather than a photon as a ""ball"" you should think of photons as non-zero values in the photon field or electromagnetic field, bumps of sorts, that move at the speed of causality (or ""speed of light"") through it, usually many of them together, with the same or different phase, etc. 

I also think that space-time is fundamental but there are alternative models in which space ""emerges"" from quantum fluctuations (but time would still be fundamental, I guess, even if maybe it's just sequence, order of events, and not seamless all-pervading time). My take is that quantum fields are specific properties of space-time, and thus all particles are nothing but ""bumps"" not in space but in the corresponding field of space-time as fundamental fabric. This is an interpretation that somehow makes sense but it has not been resolved fully yet and quantum physicists seem to dislike it, because most don't like General Relativity too much (what is a pity, IMO). Quantum mechanics seems stuck in Newtonian concepts of space and time (separated) and seems very needed of linear time, even if IMO some quantum phenomena like the DCQE experiment could be explained by accepting relativistic time (that implies that photons don't ""subjectively"" experience time at all, even if they interact with the rest of the universe ""in real time"").",1,Ugz-u1PvBMCdGLbFq894AaABAg,[]

Photons are in essence just ""waves"" (""wavicles"", ""wave-like packages"") in the EM field (property) of space-time, much like sea waves are waves in the ""ocean field"", so to say. The exact nature beyond this is not well understood because no unified ""theory of everything"" exists yet.

Basically, the electric and the magnetic field are actually a part of the same field - the electromagnetic field. The field is constructed as such that changes in one side of the field cause changes in the other. So when you have a resting electric charge, it has the same potential energy, so there are no changes in the magnetic side of the field. When it starts to move, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy and this change is reflected in a ""response"" from the magnetic side of the field, creating the magnetic effects around a charge. 

This is also why magnetic fields induce electricity and how our modern electrical supply works. Changing potential in the magnetic field causes charged particles to transform their potential energy into kinetic energy and thus they start moving. It's a two way relationship that binds the two fields and charges are the ones responsible for changes in the field. Do note that the changing magnetic field I mentioned is caused by other charged particles moving, so you can't have free electricity out of nothing.",1,UgyO7yBg2cA999X6DUF4AaABAg,[]

Also, after some point, properties like mass cease to exist...Things become more or less tightly condensed. We are mass-less at the quantum level if you think too hard about, gluons merely give the pressurized force of attraction due to their confinement within an atomic nucleus.

This said I still find it a bit ""naive"" to state with certainty what can and can never happen. Nothing is 100% certain, that is how we progress. We adjust our theories as we acquire new data and so on. EG there are many scenarios in which someone living in a simulation can discovered the truth. Just think of the Matrix or the 13th floor I think it was called. We could even discover an underlining code or errors in the universe itself that would indicate a sort of written program (some are looking into actual experiments to test the simulation hypothesis). Same goes for the other examples you made, I can think of various ways around those issues off the top of my head and I am surely no scientist.

Just because we are ignorant to all the possibilities of the multiverse dues not mean that we can't have opinions based upon what we do know ..... There are certainties about which we can make absolute claims... Especially in mathematics.

You will NEVER know for certain that you are not a simulation or a brain in a jar.   Humans will never witness the big bang.

I would be very careful in saying that something can't be done or that a specific interpretation we have today can allow us to discard any conflicting hypothesis.

1. First of all, spins go opposite from one another. That means if Bob found that a particle is spin up, he should assume a spin down particle at Alice measurement. This is one thing I'm pretty sure you know.
2. While spin is very popular when we try to show EPR paradoxes, Quantum encryption in the real world uses photon polarization as a measurement with quantum properties in the real world. It's just much easier to keep polarization stable, in long distances, and if it's not a long distance, why would you use encryption?
3. While this method is powerful and interesting to look at, it cannot replace RSA. It can replace diffie hellman protocol, which is not a Public key scheme. It is a way for 2 distant participants to exchange private keys. and...
4. This is not a practical solution for the internet. If I wanted to use this on youtube, for example, I'd have to put an optic fiber from my place to youtube. If I won't do that, I can't imagine how I can keep a photon polarition state, without reading it. However, lets imaging that we created this smart router, that can transfer a photon state without measurement, this will not help us because...
5. This method does not solve the authentication problem. This is the big one.
Encryption is designed to solve several problems. Keeping secrets is one, but there are several others, and one is authentication. Imagine I used this method, and Eve decided that she wanted to hear this conversation. She's just go several meters from her and Bob's house, dig in, and put a device on the fiber. When the message comes from Alice, she's do the measurements, and keep the results to herself, while sending her own photons to Bob, pretending to be Alice. After that she'd have 2 keys: Alice to Eve key, and Eve to Bob key. None of them will ever know the've been hacked. 
As I said, this method replaces Diffie Helman protocol, that has the exact same problem. So how is it solved in the internet? Using RSA, that while it can be used to encrypt, his more important role is providing a signing scheme. However, as you said, RSA is not Quantom safe. There are sevral solution for this, but none emerged as an internet standard at the moment.",0,,"['UgwkWTE1vBWQm4ZO4Pl4AaABAg.9DnCFe4tdoe9Dp4H5W3aqC', 'UgwkWTE1vBWQm4ZO4Pl4AaABAg.9DnCFe4tdoe9DnK35M7RNA', 'UgwkWTE1vBWQm4ZO4Pl4AaABAg.9DnCFe4tdoe9DnHESFtGsR', 'UgwkWTE1vBWQm4ZO4Pl4AaABAg.9DnCFe4tdoe9DnDL1BooFn']"

1713,UgzIMoc6MrQu9__OUu14AaABAg,fLJ9mvTS68Y,2020-09-19T13:16:07Z,Jon Fuchs,YouTube,"I have a few comments:
0:32 : This is inaccurate- Secure network communication (HTTPS ) makes usage of the ""Transport Layer Security"", also known as TLS. This protocol indeed makes usage of asymmetric primitives such as RSA or ECC in order to establish a key session, similarly to how you described the usage of BB84. Once this key is established, a symmetric cipher (AES) is then used in order to both encrypt and authenticate the communication. This means that protocols that presently being used online are mostly hybrid protocols that makes usage of the advantages of both asymmetric and symmetric cryptography.

10:04 : You could mention that this key can then be used as a one-time pad or as a session key for symmetric primitives.

11:27 : HTTPS is the one keeping you safe while you browse the internet. NordVPN is only used to add an extra (unnecessary) layer of encryption on the public data of your browsing between you and the VPN's server. This means that NordVPN can still keep track of your browsing habits, and that they are not entirely anonymous either once they leave their server. 

11:30 : It most definitely rely on a key exchange protocol to be able to use AES - They even state it in their FAQ: ""The ciphers used to generate Phase1 keys are AES-256-GCM for encryption, coupled with SHA2-384 to ensure integrity, combined with PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) using 3072-bit Diffie Hellmann keys."" 

I don't know if you rushed this video or you omitted all of this to make the sponsor look more appealing but you are spreading misinformation regarding cybersecurity and cryptography in general.

*VPNs are useful only for very particular cases* - mostly, circumventing copyright restrictions (watching Netflix from another country, or not getting caught torrenting).

Suppose we have a double slit experiment setup where we shoot one high frequency photon through at a time. To my understanding (which could be completely wrong) the 'measurement problem' in this setup is that though the photon is a wave and interferes with itself, it still appears as only a single point on the detector screen.

Now I don't know exactly how the screen works, but I assume the photon would excite one of the electrons of one of the atoms and the photon would be registered as being detected at the location of that atom.

But if I understand correctly, then it should perfect sense that the photon is only detected at one place, because a single photon can only excite one electron at a time. We wouldn't be able to see it spread out over the screen because a photon cannot partially excite many electrons, it is the lowest denomination of energy transfer and thus is either entirely absorbed by one electron or it passes through. Also I assume that it is more likely for an electron to be excited wherever the electromagnetic field is stronger i.e the crests of the interfered photon wave, producing the overall interference pattern.

Sorry for rambling, but if someone could tell me what's wrong with what I said (because it has to be wrong), it would be great.",0,,"['Ugz1_4t7osKIS2azSex4AaABAg.9CO1j7799v99CP7UZE0AAF', 'Ugz1_4t7osKIS2azSex4AaABAg.9CO1j7799v99CODDulC3MZ']"

24:44 G-d alternates the night and the day. Indeed in that is a lesson for those who have vision.

What is a radian,  take a circle, take a radius distance, wrap this radius distance around the circle on top, 6.28 times, you return to the same spot, wraping it around 3.14 times, you return to the opposite where from you ascended 

Gematria is the jewish method, for calculating numerical value of words. The jews used it in some traditions. And still are using it. Its like sprinkles on top of their deductions of their teachings in the Torah, which G-d continuously teaches them- 

27:82 And when the word befalls them, We will bring forth for them a creature from the earth speaking to them, [saying] that the people were, of Our Signs, not certain [in faith].

I wrote a computer program, I inputed all 6236 verses in the Quran in that python program. I told the program to find me a verse in the Quran with 628 in gematria sum. It returned to me this verse, and only this verse 

96:8 ""And to your Lord is the Return"" gematria sum is 628 
""The Return"" gematria is 314 

So 628 centirad is two pi 360 degree, or 314 centirad is 180degree 

I decided to look at this verse 27.82 hours into the day, the earth rotates 1 cycle and 0.1591 days. This 0.1591 turn corresponds to the unit in which the wraping of earth in ascension in degree is 1 radian, or the unit for pi. This is proof here; 

1/0.1591 = 6.28 

6:28 But what they concealed before has [now] appeared to them. And even if they were returned, they would return to that which they were forbidden; and indeed, they are liars.

""Return"" here is pronounced as ""Rudiyuan"" or basic, letters, R, dah, so if no dialetical marks, it would sound like Radi, or the scientific concept of a radius, ascended on top of the circle. 
Says it again here;
62:8 Say, ""Indeed, the death from which you flee - indeed, it will meet you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you about what you used to do.""

See the rolling earth 
https://youtu.be/Aaor5arwP04 
https://youtu.be/BxwAPBxc0lU


Explains the concept of Radians here in detail by using distance, using words such as inner and outward, first and last;
Inside the chapter called ""The Iron"" which gematria is 57 same as the chapter number, and ""Iron"" is 26 same as the p number. 
The Iron is also solid sphere inside the radius inner part of the world. Ascending this distance on top of the circle as showin in P04 link above, suggests the angle formation of 57.3 degrees in degree format, or 1 radian, in radius format;

57:3 He is the First and The last, The inner and Outward. 

The Quran suggests that discussions are made by forces that swim and have swimming nature; these forces are mentioned as ""Devil"" and ""Angel"" they are both mentioned equally, notice the knots;  88 and 88 . Devils are mentioned 88 times, Malach are mentioned 88 times.  


113:4 And from the evil of the blowers in knots

That they come from all directions and settle and moves affairs; Who knows what perturbations that happens inside our minds, with these swimming knots of energy, waves, whatever it is; 

Winnowing winds;
51:1-4 By those scattering  dispersing. And those carrying a load . And those sailing with ease. And those [angels] apportioning [each] matter,
 
Could this be gravitation, what slopes in and what holds everything and settles matter, events around in specific times?
Similar language is here 
79:3-5 

This is weird stuff.  

The case for cosine, and sine  in the Quran 
53:9 he was at a distance of twobowlenghts or nearer 

""Fakana qaba qawsayni aw adna""
""Fakana qaba qaw""

When a particle hits the detection screen the uncertainty is resolved. Any attempt to measure or determine the path of the particle before it hits the detection screen counts as a detection and any uncertainty is resolved at that instant. Hence you either get the classic interference bar pattern, or a circle of decreasing brightness towards the edges if the photons are disturbed by any attempt at measurement during flight from the source to the detector screen. 
The classic interference pattern arises even if single photons are fired through a diffraction slit because each photon has a 50:50 chance of passing through either slit. Diffraction gratings need to be of the order of the wavelength of light in order to work. The photons of light are influenced by the diffraction grating as they pass through and it is this influence that creates the interference pattern that builds up over time. If any attempt is made to identify which slit photons are passing through, this also influences the photons and you just end up with a roughly circular pattern of intensity, bright in the middle and darker towards the edges, so roughly speaking a classic beam of light.

But this is what happens, so this should be the end of it: the photon was emitted and then it is absorbed. When there are equiprobable absorbers, the universe randomly chooses one of them. The deterministic evolution of the wave function according to the rules of the Schrodinger equation comes to an end and we get an indeterminate 'collapse' to a single outcome. The wave function and any superpositions disappear because they are waves of possibility and the possibility of the photon being elsewhere after it's absorbed is zero.",1,Ugz1_4t7osKIS2azSex4AaABAg,[]

Of course, it's an analogy, the particle never stops, the coin does. But stopping the coin is analogous to detecting the particle, not fully identical because the coin does not escape and continues flipping around, the particle does. 

It seems as if just because we can't capture particles in a cage they are hyper-mysterious, they are just elusive, a bit more elusive and self-energized than flipping coins, which will always be an analogy. 

The question is, as I see it:

1. The particle is in quantum uncertainty state, no interaction (decoherence) has happened yet.
2. When interacting with the measuring device, decoherence happens and the wavefunction becomes classical: 50% chance of either state (or whichever probabilities, a complex function in the case of position in the double slit experiment with photons/electrons shot one by one but a classical probability function anyway after impact).
3. Once we observe the result, we just see if it's heads or tails, if it hit this or that coordinate... the classical probability generated in step #2 becomes classical certainty. This last step seems trivial to me, yet for some reason it is what bugs Sabine and I don't understand why (and nope: your insistence on going back to step #1 does not help, it's also trivial).",1,Ugzti3ayCm6htqVi6QF4AaABAg,[]

The way I summarize it is that a quantum system will evolve according to the Schrodinger equation so long as it has avoided decoherence.  This means that it has maintained the original entanglement (if any) all the way, and when measured it will give the predicted probabilistic outcome.  Decoherence can be unwanted, such as a laboratory mistake, or this can simply be at the moment of measurement. Wen we measure, our equipment becomes entangled with the system we are measuring. So, we get a reading to record as data.  An outside observer would simply report that the quantum system decohered.  This is why the Many Worlds Interpretation marks decoherence as the mechanism by which the world is split.

Collapse of the wave function is either the moment of measurement (whatever that is) or the moment of decoherence when all entangled relationships among the particles are lost.

As others have pointed out, the actual physics of this (the mathematics) is extremely complicated and difficult.  That is just for a simple system.  Working this out for large systems even the size of a piece of dust is possible in theory but almost impossible in practice.

What is the THE MOON is necessarily invariant AND terrestrial (a LAND relation) in accordance with the fundamental fact that E=mc2 IS F=ma, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. So, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. Therefore, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution. Therefore, the Moon is moving AND not moving IN BALANCE in conjunction with invisible AND VISIBLE SPACE in fundamental equilibrium AND BALANCE; AS E=mc2 IS then F=ma. THE MOON is ALSO manifest or shaped in balance WITH THE EYE. The Moon IS THEN manifest ON BALANCE as what is ALMOST invisible in RELATION to/with the BLUE SKY, AS the dome of a person's EYE is ALSO visible on BALANCE. Magnificent. Notice that the shape or curvature of what is the Moon matches that of what is the EARTH/ground (given what is a clear horizon, of course). SO, the ORANGE SUN is CLEARLY proven to be FUNDAMENTALLY in accordance WITH the setting, WHITENED, AND fully illuminated Moon; AS the INVARIANT form of what is the TERRESTRIAL or LAND BASED Moon is then clearly proven ON BALANCE. It is CLEARLY predictable that there will then also be the experience of less gravity in relation to what is the Moon. Importantly, BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. ""Mass""/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS E=MC2 IS F=MA; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. So, it is also CLEARLY explained why objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Great !!! It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Notice that the Earth is also BLUE (as water), AND the Earth is also ORANGE (as lava). The composition of lunar rocks is, in fact, practically identical to that of Earth rocks. Notice the black space of what is THE EYE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!! (Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) SO, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY F=ma. I now have mathematically unified physics/physical experience. Time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. INDEED, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=mc2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma in a BALANCED fashion. Again, BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. So, I have successfully and consistently used time in order to to CLEARLY PROVE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy must be gravity; AS E=mc2 IS necessarily F=ma in what is a consistent and BALANCED FASHION. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Therefore, gravitational force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great. Again, notice that the DOME of a person's EYE is ALSO visible. So, consider what is balanced BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE. Magnificent. INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience, as E=mc2 IS F=ma.

The Moon is a universal reflection of the Earth/Sun BALANCE, as the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE AND the FULL DISTANCE in/of space are linked AND BALANCED; as gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; as E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. 

E=mc2 IS F=ma. ""Mass""/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The Earth AND the Sun are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great. Therefore, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON NECESSARILY matches it's revolution. Great. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY proven to be F=ma !!!! The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. GREAT !!!!! The EARTH and the Sun constitute and comprise the MIDDLE AND THE FULL DISTANCE in/of SPACE (IN BALANCE) in full and BALANCED compliance and conformity with the CLEAR and universal fact that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Great !!!!!! Hence, it is CLEARLY proven, in fact, that the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON NECESSARILY matches it's revolution. Great. Obviously, what is THE MOON is subject to and constitutive of both E=mc2 AND F=ma. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY proven to be F=ma. ""Mass""/energy involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma.

The following constitutes even further proof of the fact that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Very importantly, in dream experience, BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE is invisible AND VISIBLE IN BALANCE. Dream experience is/involves true/real QUANTUM GRAVITY, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; as E=mc2 IS F=ma.

The momentum of a photon is directly related to its wavelength, so you could use a prism or a grating to deflect the photon at a momentum-dependent angle, followed by a camera to measure the position where the photon lands and thus the momentum it had at the prism or grating. Note that once you measure the momentum, you lost all information about its position at the prism. You could say that at least it must have gone through the prism, which is true. However, the smaller the prism, the larger the uncertainty in the angle measurement (because the wave will spread out more on its way to the detector).

Other things: polarization of a photon (vertical<->horizontal), (diagonal<->antidiagonal), or (left circular<->right circular).

The setup is a few thousand ball bearings between two perspex sheets so they can move freely in two dimensions but not the third. The whole apparatus is being vibrated at 50 or 100 Hz, and the pattern develops from many small regions of aligned lattice to a few large regions. If you watch, you'll notice, not only do large chunks move into better alignment with each other, but also small regions where 3-4 balls are missing form a reasonably stable pattern that moves through a region that's otherwise a single lattice.

If you're looking at fifty transactions, it's a lot messier to say that fifty electrons each, in turn, move to produce neutral atoms, than to say a single hole makes fifty hops - in the former interpretation, you have fifty particles each doing a small thing, without an overarching story; with the latter, you have one object doing a connected series of things that form a coherent story.


It gets even more marked when you try tracking a dozen holes through fifty steps each - if you track electrons, you have maybe 400-500 individual electrons, some of which move once, some move twice or more, without much connection between them; if you track holes, you have a dozen holes moving through the same region and it all makes sense...",1,UgwLr-ICpFiJ8Gf-x3F4AaABAg,[]

Our Solar Sun is not white but yellow in its appearance as it's light passes through the Earth's atmosphere. Remember as a kid in art class when you painted the Sun yellow. Because the device is so bright and so close to the Earth and 93 million miles infront of our Solar Sun it is cloaking (hiding, or obfuscating ) our Solar Sun. The device¬† also has special lenses that bend light like a Prism causing a cloaking effect to our Solar Sun and other objects in space. Here is how to see both the Artificial Sun Simulator and our Solar Sun behind it. You will need three (3) pairs of 100% UV Sunglasses. If the lenses are darker on the top and lighter on the bottom, you will see it better. 400% UV sunglasses will not work.¬†¬† 1.) Place 1 pair of sunglasses over another pair and hold together with a twisty at the middle to keep glasses from slipping. Place the double pair on your face like wearing sunglasses. Close 1 eye.¬†¬† 2.)WHILE LOOKING AT THE SUN, hold the 3rd pair of sunglasses 10 inches in front of the other double pair that you have on.¬† Slowly bring the second pair closer towards your eye like a telescope. You will see two suns. 1 sun will be bright white; that is the Artificial Sun/Simulator Reflector. The other sun, which is our Solar Sun will not be as bright and will appear to be a different color depending on the tinted color on the sunglass lense. Raise the pair upward and you will see how the Sun Simulators brightness hides the view of our Solar Sun.¬† If you do this technique correctly, you will see both suns.",0,,[]

Can gravity may be LIGHT DIFFRACTION? have you seen how light from quasars gets turned back? this same effect is seen in many systems from all over the cosmos and as well in a dna picture.

Matter may be seen in 3 stataes and be compared with watter: PLASMA that is the bottom or the sea that make it stars and other systems, gaseous that is the light emmited by the stars and systems that may be seen as vapor, LIGHT REFRACTED that to me comes to be CMB and that can be seen as rain so with this 3 states of matter we may figure a cicle same as rain here in earth.  LIGHT goes up the systems and CMB comes down the systems so for this reason matter must to acomodate by different levels(planets) at a point where this light and cmb gets neutralized at different level cause light pushes up and cmb pushes down and sinse practicly planets float the gravity push does not need to be so grate pluss the entanglement from north to south helps to keep matter togather;    -     Matter atracts to matter but not just any matter with any matter, some matter repeals some matter whike some matter atracts to some matter and that is where GR finds it self in big deep problem that wont ever get out of it.

__
Subspace: +ve charge cells (charge quanta, base charge +1) held together by an ethereal sea of more free-flowing -ve charge.
Inertia: Energy lost by a free cell compressing the lattice and itself is returned with a kick by the lattice 'refreezing' (balancing) behind
Electron/Positron:  A free cell and/or the hole left behind vibrate the lattice. 2 that are more than 50% out of phase turn to lattice, else they form a neutrino
EM Charge: Electrons and Positrons have (loops) of continuous in-out flows of -ve charge or +ve charge cells (or both, certainly when bonded) 
Neutrino: More than 50% in phase Electron + Positron. Minimum 6 cells long
Proton: 2 positrons joined by 1 electron (subspace charge (free cell/hole) may be important)
Neutron: Proton + Electron. Electron joins to another proton in the nucleus, decays outside via centrifugal force on the dangling electron
++++: Chunks + holes of lattice of various sizes that quickly turn to smaller chunks and holes, until electrons, positrons, neutrinos/back to regular lattice
Gravity:  Free cells are a +ve warp so attracts -ve charge away from voids that repel more and expand. Higher -ve charge density compacts the lattice.  
Time: Local time/(charge outflow speed / wave frequency?)/Speed of Light slows with charge density (Time Dilation).
Velocity: Compresses the lattice=length contraction and higher charge density. 
Black holes: Drag the whole lattice round (frame dragging)
Tunnelling: The intrinsic radial energy of positron and electron charge flow directed in one direction for a brief time, possibly travelling at C2, or even C3..
Particle entanglement: Particles linked by charge flows.. Stopping a flow at any point in the network breaks entanglement
Spin: particles (and flows?) spin (anti)clockwise perpendicular to the direction of travel.  Could be due to substructure (6 ins + 6 outs e- / p+ model)
__
Light: Is one or more layers of lattice vibrating periodically, each lattice cell never breaking free, always returning to it's central balance point
Photon:  lower lattice layers move up/down more than peak ones. longer wavelength = smaller jumps and fewer hits/s. Peak = closer up and down hits
Photon Entanglement:  Subspace charge doing its thing....... I'm not sure.

Variations of this model can lead to Big Bang and Steady State Universes, Black Hole Universes in parent universes / The Multiverse... It is quite possible the universe is NOT EXPANDING, but condensed from a hydrogen cloud, perhaps by an empty black hole core universe taking a hit from a very small, but fast moving black hole that created a homogenous field of positrons and electrons or even hydrogen that reacted and collapsed into stars and galaxies with black holes at their centres... It is possible the lattice is compressed in a container (ie. black hole shell) so instead of voids expanding due to loss of The Force (-ve base charge) either gravity wells shrink more sharply or RED / BLUE SHIFT IS PROPORTIONAL TO GALAXY MASS, higher mass, more blue.... No void expansion from -ve base charge loss or big bang momentum.... blah, blah.
--
In the standard Big Bang model I don't see the problem with viewing the universe as as the ever-widening shell of an ever-growing sphere, with an ever growing empty core. If the initial explosion petered out over time, with the first ejected matter-energy having more speed and momentum than the last ejected matter-energy space would effectively be expanding. If you see that gravity will work more strongly laterally with other matter travelling at the same speed, in relative motion, you can see how the strands form, where gravity can then do its local centralising thing....",0,,"['UgwIMzB7fr_y6PF--UZ4AaABAg.99wKr98NTRR9NMlsi5zPae', 'UgwIMzB7fr_y6PF--UZ4AaABAg.99wKr98NTRR9BTh5iNF-_1', 'UgwIMzB7fr_y6PF--UZ4AaABAg.99wKr98NTRR9BTh41JIUXx', 'UgwIMzB7fr_y6PF--UZ4AaABAg.99wKr98NTRR9AYsJ5-SGB8']"

There was a man who asked all right questions and even come up with mathematical formula, not being able to test any of it, like his discovery was just another way of asking the same thing and not part of an answer it supposed to unveil. What bodies does? They attract each other with equal and opposite amount of force that drops at square of a distance rate away from objects and you can calculate this rate of change by generating two infinitely small x values that balance out exactly. But what cause this motion and why is universe like that, nobody can answer up to a present day. So calculus is just a good question, much the same as entire field of quantum mechanics, using same arcane rules of equal and opposite linearity nothing in this universe can disturb or influence in any way. And it's important since people like Einstein added more rules to that phenomena, by realizing force can't travel faster than up to a certain limit, therefore causal order of events also depend on that calculus magic x scheme. But what is x, can it be a thing, does is it have a dimension, this is what string theory is trying to define and contain in form of some applicable algorithm. It doesn't work, if it would, we could enjoy virtual reality beyond what anybody can imagine at present. Or maybe we will experience incredible simulations once quantum computers became a consumer products, same as modern computers are based on equations for Platonic solids in mathematically generated game worlds today.
Like always in history, we need new tools and ideas how to perpetuate quantum realms, so more people can engage in research, try many crazy, even insane ideas until enough information will lead to new way of thinking and visualizing about what is this world made of deep down, where we can't see what exist with our eyes no more.

He developed General Relativity to describe this fact.
Genreral Relativity tells us that spacetime is a layered manifold of 2-D layers described by the Calculus; and the Calculus of each layer indirectly associates to every other layer..
The manifold interecting within its layers  gives rise to energy and energy interacting with energy gives rise to mass, and all massive bodies are simply falling to and from and tangent to all other bodies and energy within the manifold.
The force than attracts particles together is electromagnetism and the force that binds them is surface tension which is also electromagnetism.

¬†@Joseph McGowan¬† 1. Okay so what I meant by ""multiple tunneling events"". Was basically that potentially, for a little while, the atom remains inside the beam. And while this is happening it may or may not have it's wave function collapse repeatedly.

2. Okay I thought that's what the answer would be. I know that the strong force is as it's name says. But also that given that it's a massive atom I thought a nucleon would tunnel before the whole atom would.

3. This actually helps me understand no2 a lot better. Thx a lot! 

4. So I understand that my description is terrible here. But essentially what it boils down to is I would like to know how your team was able to discard the potential effect that those inter-atomic have. You mentioned that the atom's momentum to be imaginary while in the barrier. And while that is true as the atom is a wave function at this point. This seems to imply that you see the entire beam as the barrier? Is that an okay assumption? After all don't particles also tunnel into walls not just through them?  Is it possible that the atom only really sees the outer edge of the beam as the barrier, and finds its wave function collapsing inside the beam?

And I guess 5. It seems you're using a the change in spin axis to extrapolate time. Did you also use an another clock as a control. What if the atom and an outside observer, disagree on how long the tunneling took.",1,UgxCGNjU6gRqjsylUzR4AaABAg,[]

I'm not sure what you mean by ""multiple tunnelling events"". In a given run of the experiment, we send a cloud of a few thousand atoms at the barrier, and depending on the velocity we get anywhere from a few thousand to less than 100 atoms on the other side. Measurements taken for the final atomic spin (and therefore time) are averaged over all the atoms in a given run and then over many runs. We can count atom number fairly accurately, to within tens of atoms.

We are dealing with a big heavy atom, but our barrier is thin enough and the atoms cold enough (1 nK, de Broglie wavelength of a few microns) that tunnelling becomes appreciable. At our lowest velocity data points, the transmission rate is a few percent. Tunnelling events also *decrease* with increasing laser power, because that increases the barrier height relative to the atomic energy. The atom stays together because the energies involved are all much smaller than the energy it would take to liberate an electron or a nucleon from any individual atom. 

The wave function of the atom interacts with a potential. The atom has no way of knowing or caring what creates that potential, whether it's a laser or EM interactions with other atoms in some kind of solid surface. All it sees is the shape of the potential.

This last question is the most finicky. Basically, quantum mechanics doesn't really let you think about trajectories in that way. Nowhere do we say ""the atom went in a straight line at some speed and therefore took some amount of time"" because you can't say that. All we can say is that the atom interacted with the barrier for some amount of time. Where in the barrier it spent that time and when is not really a knowable quantity, and the question sort of doesn't even make sense within the framework of quantum mechanics. However, the direction of the momentum does not affect the interaction with the ""magnetic field"" inside the barrier (though it's worth noting that the momentum inside the barrier is imaginary and so, again, it's a strange way to phrase things). Inter-atomic interactions could potentially play a role, but at the moment we work in a regime where we can neglect those interactions. The question of what would change if you increased the strength of the interactions is an interesting one, and one we hope to probe at some point, but the main tool used to do this (Feshbach resonances) is rather difficult to implement with this particular isotope of rubidium.",1,UgxCGNjU6gRqjsylUzR4AaABAg,[]

If so did you have a way of knowing how many events could have taken place. 

If you are dealing with a heavy atom that's super cooled and moving rather slow, then wouldn't tunneling events be rather rare? And I understand that this increases with the energy of the laser, but wouldn't individual nucleons want to tunnel befor the whole atom does?

How does a wave function differ when interacting with a laser rather a physical barrier like a wall? 

And if the atom could tunnel 'inside' the beam how would the atoms momentum affect the change in spin axis? For instance, and forgive me here because I don't have better way to describe this, what if an atom was to tunnel ""inside the beam and bounce around"".

>But if shape could change it why couldn‚Äôt the structure of the material also change it??
To be clear, by ""shape"" I mean shape of the potential. Quantum mechanics doesn't care what causes a potential, just what the function is. 
>While the nature may remain the same suppose the interaction does not as one is energy the other solid matter. 
Again, QM doesn't care where the potential comes from, whether it's from interactions with light or with the atoms of a wall (which are just individual atoms in a periodic potential interacting with each other). It's also worth noting that we're talking about individual atoms interacting with a wall of atoms; what seems like a solid wall to us (at macro scale) may not even seem like a wall to an atom, which is much much smaller. 
>For does not light pass easy through clear glass but is stopped by the wall??
This is well understood. Visible light passes through clear glass (which looks clear because visible light passes through it), but not through a wall. But lower frequency light, in the microwave and radio frequency ranges, passes easily through both glass and solid walls. Every material has a refractive index, which tells you what frequencies *of light* it lets through and which it does not. But the propagation of classical light is governed by different laws than the propagation of atomic wavefunctions.
>Is this not what science is about? Questioning until we arrive at truth?
Sometimes questions must be answered by experiments, but sometimes we already have the mathematical tools to answer a question without doing an experiment. We might guess that throwing a cat into the sun would make it turn into a blueberry muffin, but we have enough math at our disposal to be pretty confident that wouldn't happen. This is hyperbole, obviously, but a similar thing is true for what you're asking. We understand the math, we understand the physics well enough to already have the answer without needing to do the experiment.",1,UgytBD3ls_-AbOvlklJ4AaABAg,[]

It's probably not dark matter since that is expected to have a large positive mass. But some believe dark matter and dark energy are the same thing. Some believe dark matter is antimatter. IDK what to believe about that at this time but empty space definitely is dark energy IMO. It has a repulsive force. This gets into the ""gravity is a push"" ideas such as the haisch rueda and puthoff theory of gravity and inertia based on stochastic electrodynamics. It basically teaches that the ""light pressure"" from the cosmic microwave background radiation exerts a force which pushes masses together. Various explanations exist for why the repulsive force between two masses is weaker than on the opposite sides. But I personally believe it's because gravity causes time dilation. Time flows faster at a high altitude vs a lower altitude. Therefore the frequency of the CMB radiation is higher on the top of a bowling ball dropped from a height than on the bottom and so the light pressure of the CMB is greater on the top than on the bottom. This asymmetry in the light pressure of the CMB radiation causes the ball to be accellerated towards the ground. You see? So gravity is due to a repulsive force from empty space. The light pressure of virtual photons in empty space is dark energy and is related to the Casimir-Polder force.",1,UgymF1NukaCktS9nolt4AaABAg,[]

Measuring a particle's spin relative to an applied magnetic field results in an observation that the direction of the spin is either aligned with (up) or against (down) the applied field, but not in any arbitrary direction in between; up or down, the two-natured-ness.

When we measure a value like the position a particle is at at a given time what we are essentially doing is collapsing its waveform to get out those time-space coordinates. The collapse is because of the measurement. When we use waveform equations to describe situations like a particle heading towards a barrier, we add in terms that are time and/or space dependent that describe the nature of the barrier in way that effectively changes the potential energy the particle ""sees"" in that region of spacetime, changing. This means that the total waveform now includes the effect of the barrier while still being a description of the probability of a particle to be in a certain space at a certain time.

*CORONA VIRUS*
*THIS IS IT!* - Give this 'Problem', [The genetic code of China shared the new virus, also know as *""2019-nCoV""* ]
to a Quantum Computer, a problem that is taking lives FAST & is need of a solution in Days, not mths or yrs!
Dr. Gershon, I saw a WIRED video where you say these comps can Simulate Chemical Bonding!...If thats the case then you can make it a task to Simulate the chemical bonding of CORONA VIRUS, have the quantum Computer break it down not just into atoms and molecular makeup but also the molar Equation.

Then the Quantum Computer can work on Simulating the chemical structure and Bonding of CORONA VIRUS AKA  *""2019-nCoV""* , and then you guys can Simulate adding chemical Additives that can deconstruct the virus, into harmless substances on the other side of the equation such as CORONA VIRUS + C6H2O? + Avacados = Ether + H2O ....

or something, hopefully you get the drift of what I'm saying & gather with all the other great minds with access to Quantum computers. those at Google too, though they be your rivals for 'Quantum Supremacy'

Surely you guys can have a Healthy alternative to the 'CURRENT WAR'
Where instead of fighting to win host the Fair & win the race to Light the World at Night!

Instead

You guys can both FIGHT to save humanity from a disease of its own, with Quantum Computers
a device that can solve problems in seconds or days that no other person or device could even in yrs or months!

Please if you can get this across to the beautiful *Dr. Talia Gershon,*

& or those at  GOOGLE & Alphabet CEO *Sundar Pichai*

pls see if you can get these brilliant people to tackle real world problems with there 'Super Computers'

Therefore, if we really want to observe ourselves and find out what we are, we must recognize we are really beings of energy and vibration, radiating our own unique energy signature.

If you observed the composition of an atom with a microscope, you would see a small, invisible tornado-like vortex, with a number of infinitely small energy vortices called quarks and photons. These are what make up the structure of the atom. If you focused in closer on the structure of the atom, you would see nothing, a literal void. The atom has no physical structure, thus we have no physical structure, and physical things really don‚Äôt have any physical structure! Atoms are made out of invisible energy, not tangible matter.

From this, scientists have made all sorts of discoveries, including that we create our own realities.

‚ÄúA fundamental conclusion of the new physics also acknowledges that the observer creates the reality. As observers, we are personally involved with the creation of our own reality. Physicists are being forced to admit that the universe is a ‚Äúmental‚Äù construction. Pioneering physicist Sir James Jeans wrote: ‚ÄúThe stream of knowledge is heading toward a non-mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter, we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter.‚Äù
~ ~ ~Dr. R. C. Henry, ‚ÄúThe Mental Universe‚Äù; 

Quantum physics has also shown that the present can change the past, that time is an illusion, and that an after-life exists. Quantum mechanics is essentially the science of consciousness and spirituality, proving just how connected we are to everything in existence, which is all an illusion.

‚ÄúThe atoms of our bodies are traceable to stars that manufactured them in their cores and exploded these enriched ingredients across our galaxy, billions of years ago. For this reason, we are biologically connected to every other living thing in the world. We are chemically connected to all molecules on Earth. And we are atomically connected to all atoms in the universe. We are not figuratively, but literally stardust.‚Äù

Therefore, if we really want to observe ourselves and find out what we are, we must recognize we are really beings of energy and vibration, radiating our own unique energy signature.

If you observed the composition of an atom with a microscope, you would see a small, invisible tornado-like vortex, with a number of infinitely small energy vortices called quarks and photons. These are what make up the structure of the atom. If you focused in closer on the structure of the atom, you would see nothing, a literal void. The atom has no physical structure, thus we have no physical structure, and physical things really don‚Äôt have any physical structure! Atoms are made out of invisible energy, not tangible matter.

From this, scientists have made all sorts of discoveries, including that we create our own realities.

‚ÄúA fundamental conclusion of the new physics also acknowledges that the observer creates the reality. As observers, we are personally involved with the creation of our own reality. Physicists are being forced to admit that the universe is a ‚Äúmental‚Äù construction. Pioneering physicist Sir James Jeans wrote: ‚ÄúThe stream of knowledge is heading toward a non-mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter, we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter.‚Äù
~ ~ ~Dr. R. C. Henry, ‚ÄúThe Mental Universe‚Äù; 

Quantum physics has also shown that the present can change the past, that time is an illusion, and that an after-life exists. Quantum mechanics is essentially the science of consciousness and spirituality, proving just how connected we are to everything in existence, which is all an illusion.

‚ÄúThe atoms of our bodies are traceable to stars that manufactured them in their cores and exploded these enriched ingredients across our galaxy, billions of years ago. For this reason, we are biologically connected to every other living thing in the world. We are chemically connected to all molecules on Earth.

Oke so imagine the cristalline structure. We can compare that to a regular speaker membrane. Normally, we have a certain structure in any crystal, the lowest energy configuration. If we compare that to a speaker, that's when the dark circle (see my User-Picture ;) is in rest, no stress applied.

So...now there's a force pushing some atoms in the cristalline structure, deforming them, literally. Now the crystal generates electricity. If you do that with a speaker, it also generates electricity.

Therefore, if we really want to observe ourselves and find out what we are, we must recognize we are really beings of energy and vibration, radiating our own unique energy signature.

If you observed the composition of an atom with a microscope, you would see a small, invisible tornado-like vortex, with a number of infinitely small energy vortices called quarks and photons. These are what make up the structure of the atom. If you focused in closer on the structure of the atom, you would see nothing, a literal void. The atom has no physical structure, thus we have no physical structure, and physical things really don‚Äôt have any physical structure! Atoms are made out of invisible energy, not tangible matter.

From this, scientists have made all sorts of discoveries, including that we create our own realities.

‚ÄúA fundamental conclusion of the new physics also acknowledges that the observer creates the reality. As observers, we are personally involved with the creation of our own reality. Physicists are being forced to admit that the universe is a ‚Äúmental‚Äù construction. Pioneering physicist Sir James Jeans wrote: ‚ÄúThe stream of knowledge is heading toward a non-mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter, we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter.‚Äù
~ ~ ~Dr. R. C. Henry, ‚ÄúThe Mental Universe‚Äù; 

Quantum physics has also shown that the present can change the past, that time is an illusion, and that an after-life exists. Quantum mechanics is essentially the science of consciousness and spirituality, proving just how connected we are to everything in existence, which is all an illusion.

‚ÄúThe atoms of our bodies are traceable to stars that manufactured them in their cores and exploded these enriched ingredients across our galaxy, billions of years ago. For this reason, we are biologically connected to every other living thing in the world. We are chemically connected to all molecules on Earth. And we are atomically connected to all atoms in the universe. We are not figuratively, but literally stardust.‚Äù

without rest, but I believe that just as we have advanced in all aspects, such
as mechanical technology, etc. everything is going much faster than 50 years
ago, viruses and bacteria have also evolved. seen this covid19 has the ability
to mutate and there is a good chance that it will mutate as it pleases. To say
it somehow it is a smart virus.





If
possible, I think that this quantum computer could search millions of
solutions, and could perform millions of simulations in a very short time,
which right now is very valuable time for doctors and infected people.





Let's put
this quantum computer to the test





In my
opinion there is nothing impossible the cure we will find sooner or later but
if this were a tool that could find this cure faster than usual I think it is
time to use it",0,,[]

I studied this stuff for a year, and one of the really confusing things was going from sinusoidal wave functions for, say, a particle in a potential well, to Dirac notation and all that vector and inner product stuff. It was never really clear how a wave function could represent a vector, or what the vector space was. I got a shaky understanding later on that taking the inner product is the equivalent of certain types of integrals on the wave function, and that the vector representation can be explained with Fourier analysis.

What is the THE MOON is necessarily invariant AND terrestrial (a LAND relation) in accordance with the fundamental fact that E=mc2 IS F=ma, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. So, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. Therefore, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution. Therefore, the Moon is moving AND not moving IN BALANCE in conjunction with invisible AND VISIBLE SPACE in fundamental equilibrium AND BALANCE; AS E=mc2 IS then F=ma. THE MOON is ALSO manifest or shaped in balance WITH THE EYE. The Moon IS THEN manifest ON BALANCE as what is ALMOST invisible in RELATION to/with the BLUE SKY, AS the dome of a person's EYE is ALSO visible on BALANCE. Magnificent. Notice that the shape or curvature of what is the Moon matches that of what is the EARTH/ground (given what is a clear horizon, of course). SO, the ORANGE SUN is CLEARLY proven to be FUNDAMENTALLY in accordance WITH the setting, WHITENED, AND fully illuminated Moon; AS the INVARIANT form of what is the TERRESTRIAL or LAND BASED Moon is then clearly proven ON BALANCE. It is CLEARLY predictable that there will then also be the experience of less gravity in relation to what is the Moon. Importantly, BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. ""Mass""/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS E=MC2 IS F=MA; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. So, it is also CLEARLY explained why objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Great !!! It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Notice that the Earth is also BLUE (as water), AND the Earth is also ORANGE (as lava). The composition of lunar rocks is, in fact, practically identical to that of Earth rocks. Notice the black space of what is THE EYE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!! (Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) SO, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY F=ma. I now have mathematically unified physics/physical experience. Time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. INDEED, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=mc2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma in a BALANCED fashion. Again, BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. So, I have successfully and consistently used time in order to to CLEARLY PROVE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy must be gravity; AS E=mc2 IS necessarily F=ma in what is a consistent and BALANCED FASHION. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Therefore, gravitational force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great. Again, notice that the DOME of a person's EYE is ALSO visible. So, consider what is balanced BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE. Magnificent. INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience, as E=mc2 IS F=ma.

The Moon is a universal reflection of the Earth/Sun BALANCE, as the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE AND the FULL DISTANCE in/of space are linked AND BALANCED; as gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; as E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. 

E=mc2 IS F=ma. ""Mass""/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The Earth AND the Sun are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great. Therefore, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON NECESSARILY matches it's revolution. Great. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY proven to be F=ma !!!! The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. GREAT !!!!! The EARTH and the Sun constitute and comprise the MIDDLE AND THE FULL DISTANCE in/of SPACE (IN BALANCE) in full and BALANCED compliance and conformity with the CLEAR and universal fact that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Great !!!!!! Hence, it is CLEARLY proven, in fact, that the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON NECESSARILY matches it's revolution. Great. Obviously, what is THE MOON is subject to and constitutive of both E=mc2 AND F=ma. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY proven to be F=ma. ""Mass""/energy involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma.

The following constitutes even further proof of the fact that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Very importantly, in dream experience, BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE is invisible AND VISIBLE IN BALANCE. Dream experience is/involves true/real QUANTUM GRAVITY, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; as E=mc2 IS F=ma.

Historically speaking, physics has gotten more ""beautiful"" over the centuries.  Part of that is discovering new symmetries (which means we can merge two fields together) and part of it is simply notational improvements.

The real reason physicists chase 'beauty' so much these days is that we don't really have anything else to look for.  The LHC confirming the Higgs to be basically what we expected means we don't have any real leads for the next step to take.  We know there _is_ a next step because of the fundamental incompatibility between QM and GR, but we're not going to be able to directly probe those energy levels likely in the next few hundred years, if ever.  Short of a miracle new collider design or a complete fluke with some astronomical event, we're stuck with just poking around at the energy scales we have available and hoping to prod something out to give us a hint.

In the meantime physicists want to stay employed, and our only real ""hint"" for what's next is following the history of unification.  Maybe the planned LHC upgrades will prod out something new like those elusive SUSY particles we keep expecting, but really there's not much guarantee that anything exists between the Higgs and the energy levels where we expect GUT to occur, and even that is likely a good couple of collider generations (not just upgrades) away still.  Which could be a century or more given how long it takes to design, fund and build such immense projects.",1,UgxU_mxi1JesUgiGD7V4AaABAg,[]

Now back to yr comment, you made me realise what the ‚Äòbrick wall‚Äô in my learning was, time and time again I was mentally hitting this wall and now I know, through yr comment, what was causing this, it was simply due to the fact that I overlooked the word ‚Äúprobability‚Äô , ofcourse in QM this word is everywhere and I never took the time to understand the significance of this word , now though I‚Äôve grasped this concept, doh üòñ, of course the probability will change once you‚Äôve made a measurement , Doh üòñ, Doh üòñ & Doh üòñ.
How the hell have I missed this info , I‚Äôve probably (no pun intended) read it or watched it 100 x yet it hasn‚Äôt sunk in, till now.
Kudos to you , right now I‚Äôm having a ‚Äúmind meld‚Äù as everything is suddenly falling into place, this doesn‚Äôt mean I can suddenly grasp QM but I can now take my learning to another level , finally .

You can't have any more than probability because it would then include the impossible outcome.  Come to think of it probability distribution curves go out way into the skinny tails. But it's less and less likely. Like the probability of being able to pass a philosopher through a double slit experiment. It has a very small probability.,1,Ugz5ly5NW3-OLG5DGjF4AaABAg,[]

We cannot transfer information faster the light. 
Correct. 

What we do is to circumvent this impossibility. And 
this is how it works, right now in the lab in the first 
cautious steps. 

Photons coming from one source are entangled and 
radiated in two directions. The distance of the source 
to end point A and end point B is exactly adjusted. 

At end A, a signal is shown to the photons. The signal 
is seen at the same moment without any delay at 
the entangled photons of side B. 

Nothing happens beyond the speed of light. Although 
the two endpoints are spatially separated, the 
entangled photons are a single quantum system that 
exists regardless of the distance of its components. 

So, if your imprinted signal is your spoken language, 
you have a delay-free real-time dialogue.",0,,[]

I've looked down to the horizon when in a plane, even as a passenger on commercial and when in cockpit of light aircraft from around 5000 feet, though the latter takes more care to spot. But you've seen and heard all this.
My dear special little half wit, here are some facts from the real world. Earth is a slightly flattened globe. Jupiter is a big ball of colourful gas. The moon is rock samples of which were returned by astronauts over half a century ago and just the other day by an un crewed Chinese space craft. The sun is a bloody big ball of plasma a mere 6000K on the surface but damned hot in the middle. Clever people over the last couple of centuries or so have worked these things out and a lot more and explained things in terms that are understandable by anyone not suffering from extreme mental impairment. 
If you are being honest and truly cannot understand what I am explaining you need not be ashamed. Some people don't have legs for example, doesn't make them lesser. 
I'll bet anything you have a corresponding ability somewhere in you. Maybe you have a massive bodily intelligence allowing you to be an acrobat. 
Normal learning isn't the be all of human intelligence. But if you are weak in those areas I promise you that you are being fooled by the flat earth liars like RIley and Oakley and Dubay and all the rest of them. They are taking you.
IF you are giving them money, please stop - they're conning you.
On the other hand you could be one of the cons yourself. Frankly it strikes me a  low return con. But maybe that's your line. How am I to know if you are a scammer or a victim. Only you know that.
As I said if you're paying out to flat earth channels you should stop.For your own good.
If you're on the make then well all I can say is kindly eff orf.

The Pauli principle is not a definition, it is a consequence of the symmetrization postulate when applied to fermionic indistinguishable particles, which states that the overall state must be totally antisymmetric under particle exchange.

 Who is  Jesus? Not who is He to you. Rather, who is He really?

Jesus is the Son of God, who came to the world as a man. He lived a perfect and sinless life . Even though He was perfect and sinless, on the cross of Calvary God wrathfully punished Him for the sins of the world. 3 days later He rose from death. Now He is seated at the right hand of God, ruling as King over Heaven and Earth.
On the judgment day He will judge you, me and every human being that has ever lived. Those who believed in Him will enter eternal joy with Him, but those who did not believe in Jesus will be sent to eternal condemnation. 

So turn from your sins and believe in the Jesus, that you can be forgiven for all your sins, because of His death and resurrection.

Acts 15:11
‚ÄùOn the contrary, we believe it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.""
Ephesians 1:7
‚ÄùIn Him, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace""
Ephesians 2:8
‚ÄùFor it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God,‚Äù

John 11:25-26: ""Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?'
1 Corinthians 6:14: ""And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.""
Romans 6:9: ""We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.""",1,Ugy46PTkqVFK_GYVxHF4AaABAg,[]

Things going at light speed do not experience time, so you need a loop, with enough characters to have a message, that can be changed like a digital sign.  You need perfect mirrors to keep light going at light speed.  Perfect mirrors are not physical mirrors, they bend light with EMR.  In a vacuum, a message sent in code form, like Morse code or fax machine or whatever, would appear as it is programmed to, at every point in time in which it exists.  Whenever the message is changed, it changes At every Point in time in which it exists,  so if you change it today, it changes to that new message yesterday, and back until the day it was started, and changes the message it displays in the future until it ceases to exist.  That is my interpretation of quantum computing.  What the qubit adds to programming is not what I see to be like a supernatural advance, it is nice, but it doesn't make things faster than time itself.",0,,[]

Both agree there is spiritual substance which is called Brahman from which all matter is manifested . Impersonalists believes that Brahman is without variety and personalists concludes that there is supreme variety. There was big personality on side of personalists in 15th century called Caitanya Mahaprabhu who philosopically destroyed impersonalist. So if you are interested i am adding few sources which connecting teaching of Mahaprabhu  with recent science and it would be very blissfull if you try to apply it in your next video. https://prabhupadabooks.com/ej/1?d=1 (antimatterial worlds)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6T8cIJthGg&list=PLKVQRAZMT7-lGOfZ0XG4HBdhM-8p2yvYN  (theory of everything -vedantic perespective)

in ancient schools of philosophy of India(Sankya philosophy) there are two realities which is parallel to each other never reaching each other independently eternally exist 
they are Purusha (consciousness, self, god, soul,, male....) 
and Prakriti (nature female)
they coexist without interacting with each other. through mind Purusha can experince  Prakriti.
Prakriti or nature is consist of 1-kala 2-desha 3-vastu (1-time 2-space 3-causation [object made of information Akasha and energy Prana])
 what they mean by causation is there must be information Akasha so that energy Prana can dance according to this basis of information.
this was Sankya philosophy in Buddhism lord Buddha always speak about Prakriti and avoid talking about Purusha
"" impermanent impermanent everything is impermanent
momentary momentary everything is momentary
 void void everything is momentary""
claiming the emptiness is the ultimate reality. he also mentioned that sense of the self or the concept of ego is part of nature and therefor not real.  as far as I researched he most of the time avoid talking about  God or spoke in an enigmatic way.

We are AI in a simulation. The AI is the code, tasked to survive and propagate in the simulation by learning.

Descartes‚Äôs dualism seems to tell us that the interaction between the mental and the physical realms is impossible.The interaction problem isn‚Äôt just a gap in the theory. It‚Äôs a built-in refutation 
of the theory.Gottfried Leibniz offered a theory to explain how the two realms interect . According to his theory there is no real causal interaction between the two realms. 
‚óã But at the beginning of the creation, God wound up a physical clock that would carry forward the entire physical history of the universe. Beside it he wound up a clock of mental events to carry forward the mental history of the universe. 
‚óã In his wisdom, God designed the clocks so that they would run perfectly in parallel, side by side, despite the lack of any real link between them. 
It is known as Leibniz‚Äôs doctrine of pre-established harmony.
‚óè Both of these are attempts to live with the implications implicit in Cartesian dualism. If Leibniz‚Äôs theories seem like desperate 
measures, they‚Äôre an indication of the desperate measures that a full-blown dualism seems to require.",0,,"['UgyCvi6LqT3uO4LrWiV4AaABAg.9CcnM-uNFLK9Cml71OiI5n', 'UgyCvi6LqT3uO4LrWiV4AaABAg.9CcnM-uNFLK9CmigLzlDsk', 'UgyCvi6LqT3uO4LrWiV4AaABAg.9CcnM-uNFLK9Ce08GwU7NX', 'UgyCvi6LqT3uO4LrWiV4AaABAg.9CcnM-uNFLK9CdX43Vq5ta', 'UgyCvi6LqT3uO4LrWiV4AaABAg.9CcnM-uNFLK9CdKFgV0NRO']"

I don't like the ""qualia"" argument, and the thought experiment about the woman who lives in a room where she has never seen the color ""red"" is flawed at step one.

The premise is that she receives a printout of ""everything she could possibly know about the color red"".  That's implicitly not true.  The actual color itself is ""information about the color"". She never receives the color itself, so she does not have everything she could know about red.

To the extent I'm a dualist, I'm neither a qualia-type dualist, a Berkeleyan dualist or a Cartesian dualist.  Human relationships -- the interface between two emotionally intimate and emotionally available people -- are the thing that defines reality.  As fascinated as I am by modern pop physics, even quantum theory is just a story we tell ourselves about how the world works.  It's not ""important"" in anything close to the way intimacy is.  

And I don't mean anything sexual -- as Martin Buber describes in ""Between Man And Man"", you can have an emotionally intimate moment with someone you've never met, and it can happen with no words being exchanged.  It happens when you share a glance of recognition with another person and recognize the common humanity in each of us.

That is ""reality"".  The rest is just stories we tell ourselves about reality.",0,,['Ugz3VNJ3pEx0WnpZca94AaABAg.9Ccfv8T57kY9CcmkuMNzmC']

That's rather self-absorbed of humanity to think. We may actually have ended up at a stunted end of the consciousness where we didn't quite develop everything to perceive our surroundings at a state high enough since the only state we ever truly *need* is the state of survival. No situation on Earth has required more advanced brain function than predicting a few hours into the future and keeping track of a target out of your line of sight for more than five seconds (since by then, their location is uncertain and you must return to a vigilant state or prepared one, not a stuck expected one). 

What's interesting is that consciousness can be incredibly heavily altered by many different chemicals. I wonder if the more excited neurologically active state (ie, caffeine, fear, arousal) also includes more accurately fixated super-positioned states, if such an idea has grounds, which considering the neediness of myelinated neurons may not be totally there. That myelination may also be key; the speed of thought being so rapid we get the illusion of consciousness. Like we really are just monkeys that started to think fast enough to worry about what to wear for dinner. 

Not sure quantum entanglement can be proven by phosphorous without knowing every variable we're missing, and knowing the missing variables would solve it anyway, so woops. There may just be too many variables for our limited survival-geared consciousness. (The whether is the same across the world. Are they causally correlated? It may be coincidence, or we may just not have realized the predominant winds are similar in the areas, the amount of coastline is the same, and they're on the same latitude. 

An argument against smell and quantum consciousness being linked and relevant is that smell actually diminished greatly as Order primates were selected for survival in more recent epochs. Other animals without consciousness retained this strong sense of smell; which was the very first sensory organ (as we understand it) to develop in animals, and often is the strongest, though specializations are common. Sight and the distinguishing of the color spectrum more clearly is far more selected in our family Order, and we have a HUGE amount of reliance on our same consciousness to bring that smell to bear, rather than instinctual uses for it with the exception of sugar (scarce energy source pre-agriculture), . There is a man who can smell at drug dog levels, and he's pretty legit. Trials indicate that is indeed possible. Our brains required more and more support to both have stronger olfactory senses and keep our strengthening pre-frontal cortexes, sight developing in the back of our brain, amongst other things. 

For how much of our olfactory sense is garbage DNA code, we push a LOT of our brainpower into it, since memory is also inextricably linked to smell- when one has issues smelling correctly, it actually creates anxiety, since it always seems like something is wrong, or something is dead under your bed, or something else ridiculous. Anyone who has done a significant amount of drugs has likely experienced this without realizing as such. I think a counter-counter argument to neural processing limits is that as our brain got bigger for various reasons, if that superpositioned state is maintained, it would have to get more and more complex to stay supported.

     Prediction in science stem from models. Models are created with assumptions. If the assumptions hold the predictions can be highly accurate. The success of the model is not proof of the concept, because knowledge is always unfolding. As you know Popper's rule prevents any scientific theory from being taken as  ""the word of god"". If a theory cannot be tested then it isn't scientific. Why? Because, as Godel theorized, knowledge is incomplete. Scientific theories rely on some assumptions that are uncorroborateable.

You can remove this uncertainty (information, entropy) by continually taking measurements and 'averaging' the results, the averaging process is called prediction or syntropy -- target tracking or teleology.
You should study the Kalman filter algorithm if you want proof of what I have just said.
The Kalman filter algorithm is physical proof of syntropy and optimizing prediction.
Your brain organizes information into optimized predictions -- thinking, syntropy.
Certainty is dual to uncertainty -- Heisenberg.
Syntropy is dual to increasing entropy -- the 4th law of thermodynamics.
Thinking or syntropy is the continual process of trying to remove uncertainty from your measurements, this is a dual process to that of increasing entropy!
Teleological physics is dual to non-teleological physics.
Syntropy is teleological in nature or the final cause of Aristotle, a target or goal.

The 4 causes of Aristotle as applied to the shoemaker are 1) material cause - leather out of which a shoe is made 2) formal cause - design of shoe (sneaker, slippers..) 3) efficient cause - the designer or shoemaker 4) final cause - purpose or to protect the foot.
    Your application of the dialectic to the 4 causes are inappropriate. Your numbering of them first cause ...final cause is confusing.
    Your application of ""duality"" to measurement is intriguing however. A measurement in science can also be generalized as an observation. To assert that measurement is a synthesis of certainty and uncertainty seems false on its face. It would seem that the the synthesis of certainty and uncertainty should be statistics, which deals in percentages.
     Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle deals mainly with the limits of measurement. The point at which an observation no longer remains independent of the observer. The point where the observer ""interferes"" with the observation: where the measurement is no longer independent of the measurer. Measurement in science is only valid  if it is independent of which scientist is doing the measuring: or if every scientist gets the same measurement for the same experiment. This ""concensus"" lies at the heart of science and is the reason why science is considered reliable by so many, including religious folk.
     Statistics arise when there is more than one valid outcome. In such cases a methodology is required in order to make a binary (or dual) determination of an experiment. A classic example would be the determination of whether a river has been contaminated by a toxic spill. You take samples of water and test them for contaminants. But how many and where in the river? Depending on the methodology the determination becomes more or less valid.
     Some measurements in science do not require statistics they rely on apparatus to give extremely reliable measurements. Scales, voltmeters, temperature and pressure gages, etc.. There are 2 measurements however that are wholly dependent on the measurer, time and space. Indeed it would be precise to say they are imposed by the measurer.
     When we think of a measurement we imagine that it is not usually a thing made of parts. It is a unity not a ""duality"" or a ""variability"" or a statistic. Your weight, the temperature the time all have a single, unified meaning. But is this unity misleading? Similarly when we observe things we do not have a shifting understanding or experience  of things. A book, a tree, a person, a car crash a death all are unified facts in our minds.

However, there is an obvious objection to this thought experiment (also mentioned in the article), i.e. if we really remove _all_ the external sensory inputs and _all_ ""internal"" inputs like memory and imagination, there is really nothing left.

Besides the main senses like vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste, etc. there are other senses which he probably didn't think of back then, like proprioception, feeling of heat/cold, pain. Feeling tired, ill, hungry, thirsty, .. And then there are various emotions which can also be subjectively experienced: happy, sad, anxious, angry, frustrated, feeling affection, jealousy, envy, etc. If we take away all these stimuli I don't think we can speak of consciousness anymore becase there is _nothing to be conscious of._",1,UgyCvi6LqT3uO4LrWiV4AaABAg,[]

This person has no memories, having only just been created. Will his mind be a blank, devoid as it is of past or present sensory experience? No, says Avicenna. He will be aware of his own existence.

If the it didn't exist, there would be no ""cogito"". However all rest, all content of thoughts can be fake and its veracity doubted. Sensory input could be fake (like in Matrix, or in a dream).

I dont't see a problem with this but I also don't understand how people get mind-body dualism from this. Yes, the body you observe doesn't necessarily have to be your real body - it can be an ""avatar"" - but the real body (the thing which does the actual thinking) still has to exist somewhere (memory is stored somewhere, information is processed somewhere), even if we cannot perceive its true form. In the Matrix analogy it is outside of the simulation, jacked in. In the dream analogy we perceive a fake dream-reality during sleep while our real body lies motionless in a bed.

Plato's alegory of the cave maybe does a better job explaining this. As prisoners chained to a cave wall we can only observe the shadows of objects on the opposite wall. We cannot perceive the objects themselves as they really are. One of these shadows is supposedly the shadow cast by our body. But even if we have no way of fully verifying that because it is possible that our real body doesn't cast any shadow we still know it must exist.

Edit: After second read I see I probably missed the point of the ""cogito ergo sum"" criticism which seems to be that the ""cogito"" already includes the ""I"" (the sense of being a person) while in principle that can be faked as well? I.e. our sense of self is dependent on the exact content of the mind at any given moment, which includes a mix of memories and sensory information from our body. That's an interesting consideration, and begs a question - if we take away all the qualia, all the informational content from the mind - can we still talk about consciousness? I would argue that probably not.",1,UgyCvi6LqT3uO4LrWiV4AaABAg,[]

One thought has occurred to me in the past though that its possible that god simply wanted a species capable of understanding and fully appreciating what it had created. Kinda sucks making the coolest thing ever with no one to see it.

If we wish to map a brain as a model so we can predict what it will do next or why it made the choice it made we would have to know every process. So how many processes are we talking here...  well the brain is said to have 86 billion neurons, each neuron in theory can be connected to 10,000 other neurons, and having as many as 1 trillion synaptic connections, so taking that this model has then been subjected and programmed over years of interactions with electrical impulses of  sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch including every chemical mix that is going on in the body (blood pumping through it carrying every chemical mix going) we know drugs, food, everything that happens in the body affects how the brain reacts so hence this is also an effect over time as to how the brain functions.  so taking this as the brain model a choice it takes may be tracked back through time and hence is predictable if EVERY state and EVERY event is tracked over this time.   When i say complex boy are we talking complex lol....  and going forward as to the next choice lets take this idea and explore.. If we could clone a brain Exactly (every atom , string EVERYTHING and perfectly without error)  now put that brain in two bodies. the instance you do this the brains will start to absorb information from every sense , every chemical , over time and hence diverges of thought would take place and you would have two very different brains that would make the next choice differently.",1,Ugx2SM0r1S0lyLHWhul4AaABAg,[]

*CORONA VIRUS*
*THIS IS IT!* - Give this 'Problem', [The genetic code of China shared the new virus, also know as *""2019-nCoV""* ]
to a Quantum Computer, a problem that is taking lives FAST & is need of a solution in Days, not mths or yrs!
Dr. Gershon, I saw a WIRED video where you say these comps can Simulate Chemical Bonding!...If thats the case then you can make it a task to Simulate the chemical bonding of CORONA VIRUS, have the quantum Computer break it down not just into atoms and molecular makeup but also the molar Equation.

Then the Quantum Computer can work on Simulating the chemical structure and Bonding of CORONA VIRUS AKA  *""2019-nCoV""* , and then you guys can Simulate adding chemical Additives that can deconstruct the virus, into harmless substances on the other side of the equation such as CORONA VIRUS + C6H2O? + Avacados = Ester + H2O ....

An avacado has 1 general molecular formula that describes its constituents, so does an apple or the chemical drug Panadol. All well known drug additives & most natural fruits & remedies have 1 general molecular formula that describes them. there are basic computer programs that highschool

students and Universities use called *MathLAB* which has a library of mathematical formulae that help them solve a with range of mathematical & real world problems[wiki says MatLAB was developed since 1968]. there must be a program called ""ChemLAB"" or something similar,

that has an ever growing library of natural foods, herbs, drugs & their corresponding (1) general molecular & chemical formula. [ such as water=H2O Apple= etc,etc & so on & so on...]

hopefully you get the drift of what I'm saying & gather with all the other great minds with access to Quantum computers, & interface them with a suitable ""ChemLAB"" software & its vast library of molecular formulae for all the drugs & natural remedies of Earth...

so that the Quantum Computer [guided by doctors & Quantum Scientist] can run simulations adding combinations of these remedies to the molecular formula for ""COVID19"" until it breaks down into simple sugars or chemicals that the body can dispense of.

This way a real *Quantum Computer* that has achieved *""QUANTUM SUPREMACY""* should beable to *SOLVE Corona Virus* in a matter of Hours, not days or months.

 those at Google too, though they be your rivals for 'Quantum Supremacy'

Surely you guys can have a Healthy alternative to the 'CURRENT WAR'
Where instead of fighting to win host the Fair & win the race to Light the World at Night!
Instead

You guys can both FIGHT to save humanity from a disease of its own, with Quantum Computers
a device that can solve problems in seconds or days that no other person or device could even in yrs or months!

Please if you can get this across to the beautiful *Dr. Talia Gershon,*

& or those at  GOOGLE & Alphabet CEO *Sundar Pichai*

pls see if you can get these brilliant people to tackle real world problems with there 'Super Computers'

Assuming the star trek beam teleport technology exist today, if someone is infected with coronavirus, when they are beamed to the target location, is the virus beamed along with the person to the target location? sorry if this is a stupid question. but virus is such a tiny particle that keeps changing unpredictably, does teleportation only beam what is fixed and predictable particles? or can it handle unpredictably changing particles?

They give no scientific explanation, just ""it must of been"", with no math, examples, nothing. Here is all they have to assert:
""Counter-rotating gas streams are unstable, which means that clouds fall into the black hole faster than they do in a disk with a single rotation direction,"" said Impellizzeri. ""This could be a way in which a black hole can grow rapidly."" NGC 1068 (also known as Messier 77) is a spiral galaxy approximately 47 million light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Cetus. At its center is an active galactic nucleus, a supermassive black hole that is actively feeding itself from a thin, rotating disk of gas and dust, also known as an accretion disk.

Previous ALMA observations revealed that the black hole is not only gulping down material, but also spewing out gas at incredibly high speeds‚Äîup to 500 kilometers per second (more than one million miles per hour). This gas that gets expelled from the accretion disk likely contributes to hiding the region around the black hole from optical telescopes.

This non-local force was introduced by David Bohm who had discussed this with Einstein so I'm sure that as of now it does not conflict with SR.

Pointing in two directions has a meaning when physics is non-real. The spin property is then simply not single valued until it is measurement. Using reductio ad absurdum in physics or math is not a valid method of proving that something is inconsistent or wrong or whatever is tried to prove. The mysteriousness that follows from a non-real physics stops getting mysterious when you work and think about it, anyways it's not that mysterious for me as it used to be.

I really dislike the 'shut up and calculate' method of the universities especially when it is possible to 'derive' the Schrodinger equation and Born's probability rule in two lectures. My university gives a Master's course on different interpretations of QM such as the MWI, Bohmian mechanics and some others.

This is not correct.

There are indeed correlations, but there is no force, non-local or otherwise, ""causing"" those correlations.

Think of a pair of gloves, one left-handed and one right-handed, the observation of one of them to be, say, right-handed, does not ""influence"" the other by means of any 'force', non-local or otherwise. to become left-handed.

In fact ANY supraluminal influence is specifically precluded by special relativity.
(which is the reason WHY the correlations cannot be used to communicate information faster than light)

and secondly, where you say:
one can 

""drop the idea of a vector pointing in two directions if you introduce a non-local force but in practice you will still always use a vector pointing in two directions. There is still no way to tell one theory from the other...""

One MUST drop the PSEUDO-idea of a vector ""pointing in two directions"", because it is not even and idea! 
It is simply a bunch of words put together that can have no meaning. It doesn't MEAN anything!
If you think otherwise, try to examine what you yourself PERSONALLY understand by ...""pointing in two directions at the same time""...can you draw it? picture it? what exactly IS it that you YOURSELF mean when YOU use that phrase?

And what do you mean by: ""in practice you will still always use a vector pointing in two directions"". in practice? LOL

¬†in ""practice"" there is no need whatsoever to ""use""(whatever that means here) the meaningless pseudo-idea any more than there is any need to ""use"" it when merely thinking about or discussing the topic.

In PRACTICE, insofar as Bell Test experiments are concerned, there is no need to use anything except laboratory equipment and the simple linear mathematics of spin superposition.

And yes there IS a way to "" ...tell one ""theory"" from the other...""

You can do it the same way you can prove the square-root of two to be irrational!
In other words by ""reductio ad absurdum"", that is by logical contradiction. 

Specifically, the ""theory"" (which isn't a theory really,  its just a non-understanding of superposition), which claims that a spin can be pointing both up and down simultaneously, 
couldn't possibly be correct 
precisely BECAUSE 
implicit in what is meant by ""down"" is ""not-UP"", 
and it is not possible for a spin to be UP and not-UP at the same instant, 
since the meaning of one contradicts the meaning of the other.

There IS no ""mysterious way we don't yet understand"" in which a spin can be both pointing ""UP"" and pointing ""not-UP"" at the same instant. 

Its not ""mysterious"" it's simply without meaning!

A magician may appear to mysteriously levitate someone on stage, contravening the laws of physics, but its only ""mysterious"" until you understand how the trick is done!

LIkewise the Bell test experimental correlations require no faster than light signalling and is equally easy to understand once you see how THAT trick is done!

But you are unlikely to understand it as long as you insist that perhaps the person really IS being levitated on stage !
As long as you are content with the illusion you will not see how the trick is done.

Unfortunately, every course in every university that teaches quantum mechanics, teaches also the mantra ""shut up and calculate"". Students are told that it is not understood, and they grow up to be professors who insist that THEIR students likewise should not even try to understand it.

They cannot impart any such understanding to their students, because they themselves do not understand it, not because it is ""difficult"" (it isn't, its really simple! ) but simply because they themselves were never taught it!

All it requires is a simple clarifying tweak to the way we understand the simple concept of a ""vector"", and the Bell results, entanglement etc all follow with such obviousness you'll wonder how the heck you ever thought this stuff was even in the least bit mysterious!",1,Ugya2wZyL4EJLpuzTI14AaABAg,[]

In the interpretation that is used physics is non-real and a property such as position, velocity or spin is simply can have multiple values (non-real). If you say that that is bs then that leaves you the option of a well defined spin, position and velocity but with physics that can be non-local. 

For example if you have two entangled particles A and B, then a measurement of A influences the measurement of particle B by means of a non-local force. This leads to non-local correlations and this has been measured by several universities. But these correlations cannot be used to transmit information which is very important.

Personally, I like the non-local force over the non-real theory but the non-real theory is more advanced. So any physicist will use the non-real and spooky one because it is more powerful. Besides, if there is no falsification of the non-real theory then all I can do is accept its hypotheses (with all the verified predictions in mind too of course).

 ""When you say pointing into two direction then you already have made  the assumption that an electron is a classical (particle)""

I am NOT. I am saying that the very NOTION of a vector pointing two different directions simultaneously, is nonsense. 
Its not a statement about particles, classical or otherwise, its a statement about what we mean when we use the verb ""to point"". What does ""to point"" mean? what do we mean by ""direction""?

secondly. to say that something is inaccurate because it applies to ""classical"" particles.. is (in this instance) to tacitly imply that things might be different for ""quantum"" particles. But this is just a kind of circular arguement which can be more easily seen if you just substitute the word ""magical"" for the word ""quantum"".

In other words, the use of the word ""quantum"" in no way makes self-contradiction one iota more acceptable.

eg. saying something like ""a classical vector cannot point in two different directions at the same time..... but ""quantum"" vectors CAN...because the ""quantum"" world is ""different"".

Is simply using the word ""quantum"" as a synonym for the word""magical"" and using THAT to excuse yourself from logical thought!

The concepts of ""direction"" and ""point"" have nothing to do per se with ""quantum"" OR ""classical"" physics. they are rather concepts in which we THINK!

Specifically, Œîx * Œîp ‚â• ƒß/2, which in English means ""the product of the uncertainty in position and the uncertainty in momentum is always greater than or equal to half Planck's proportionality constant"".

Since it's a product, if you have an arbitrarily large uncertainty in momentum, Œîp tends toward infinity, and the Œîx term can become arbitrarily small (as close to 0 uncertainty as you like).

This change, from a spread-out wave function to a tightly peaked wave function of arbitrary precision or narrowness, whatever your interpretation describes it as, is experimentally verified as being completely real. If you measure the location to such arbitrary precision, and then measure it again very soon after that, and again very soon after that, you will continue to find it in the same place each time; the wave function does immediately begin to spread out again from that sharp peak, but if you measure it quickly enough again, it won't have had time to spread very far, and the probability of finding it in the same place each time will remain arbitrarily close to 1.

Whether that means, as you asked, that ""the particle actually takes an exact position at the time we made the measurement"" depends on what interpretation you like best. In Copenhagen, the answer is unambiguously ""yes"", which seems good at first, until you realize that by defining that answer to be 'yes', you've now almost irrevocably lost your definition for what ""measurement"" means, in a sort of linguistic uncertainty relationship. XD

In Many Worlds, the answer is ""no, but the part of you that you're aware of will find itself in a part/branch of the wave function of the universe in which you observed it to be in an exact and precise position"".

In Pilot Wave Theory, the answer is ""No, the particle always had an exact position, guided by the wave function, and you just measured it to be there because it was, in fact, really there at that time regardless of whether or not you measured it.""

In Spontaneous Collapse theories, the answer is, ""Well... yes, but not _because_ you made a measurement, or at least, not because _you_ made a measurement; decoherence/collapse happens all the time, so maybe it would've collapsed just then without the measurement, or maybe not, but yes, it really is there at that time.""

To do the position measurement you have to bombard the particle you are measuring with another particle, and the ""measuring"" particle has some frequency/energy. The higher the frequency of the particle you are measuring with, the better defined your position measurement is, meaning that an x-ray photon can better localize an electron than a microwave photon can. So no, the wavefunction of a collapsed particle never has zero width (a good thing, since this would correspond to potentially infinite momentum & energy!)


Actually, it is possible to measure the position of a particle *without* bombarding it, using electric fields or similar.

And yet, perhaps infuriatingly, when you combine all of our best models and analyses of both QED and QCD, what pops out is the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and there you have particles all over again. Reality sucks like that sometimes. XD

On a more serious note, there is a sense in which particles are somewhat unavoidable in pure quantum field theories, because those particular disturbances/oscillations in the electron field, the quark field, etc, happen to be remarkably stable, self-sustaining, and move and act very much like particles, so... it just makes sense to model them as particles sometimes, hence the Standard Model.",1,Ugwc3_oVJ6_rZGUxZ6F4AaABAg,[]

For example, the virtual photons exchanged between two electrons repelling each other are not the ""real"" massless, light-speed-traveling photons you know and love, but rather sort of ""heavy"" photons with non-zero mass (sometimes quite a lot of non-zero mass).

How ""real"" you personally feel those virtual particles to be is obviously a matter of some debate. Like the wave function itself, you'll never _observe_ a virtual particle... yet you can infer their... I hesitate to say 'existence'... from the fact that particles do in fact interact via the electromagnetic field.

I think it would be more accurate to say that those discrete 'chunks' that we consider real, observable particles to come in are overwhelmingly the most likely and most stable configurations that disturbances in the relevant fields can take... but the fields themselves, at least as far as I understand, are not quantized, but rather are smoothly evolving with any value throughout spacetime, and coupled to each other in many interesting ways.

As Dr. Carroll insinuated, there is nothing ""inherently quantum"" about electromagnetic waves or the particles they represent; rather it is the boundary conditions of specific systems that creates the quantization, such as the string in the box, or the electrons near an atomic nucleus.

So like Paul Bartrum said, ""Neither"" is the correct answer, I'm just pointing out some nuance. Well... depending on your interpretations of QM. In De Broglie-Bohm Pilot Wave Theory, for example, the answer would be ""kind of the latter"", since in that theory, particles are actual discrete objects, _and_ the wave function is fundamental and real, with the particles interacting with the wave like buoys bobbing on the surface of the sea.",1,Ugye7PvtHVxaevKtKeR4AaABAg,[]

Time doesn't appear as an explicit variable in the rule as it is the same for all time. But it holds for a whole history. In the contrast you could imagine a situation where the green box doesn't move to ""keep the rule in place"". You could still say that the rule describes the starting configuration but doesn't describe later configurations. If I don't know whether the description bridges time I don't know from the starting configuration whether the green box is dodgey or not.
If I have a history it will have a time derivate (if it is smooth enough) regarless if I know the behavioural rules. And if I know the behavioural rules then I can deduce the history from a snapshot.

To my knowledge, spin has nothing to do with how electrons emit light, other than that it helps determine what orbits electrons can assume. Spin cannot ""accelerate"" as such; it has only two values (or rather, one value that can point in multiple directions): 1/2 and -1/2. That isn't tied to frequency of light in any way I'm aware of; spin is a magnetic property, while light is caused by the change in the electromagnetic field caused by the electron's electric charge moving, especially in an oscillatory fashion.

Additionally, electrons may or may not even have physical size; to the best of our ability to tell thus far, they are point-like. This makes the idea of them being capable of ""tension"" or ""deformation"" dubious at best; indeed, if they did, and that could be confirmed, those would be new degrees of freedom that, to my knowledge, we are fairly certain electrons do not have.

As for how light is emitted... there are a variety of answers that go into a variety of levels of detail, but in essence, the particle/wave entity in the electron field that we call an electron, through the electron field's strong coupling to the electromagnetic field (which we call its electric charge), sets up a sympathetic vibration in the electromagnetic field as it oscillates.

Decoherence is ""a solution"" in the sense that ""trusses"" are ""a solution"" to how to build a strong and light structure. You still have to define what exactly you mean by decoherence, when you think it happens, why you think it happens, etc.

In Many Worlds, the answers to those questions are something like ""By decoherence we mean the process by which the wave function of the system you're interested in becomes entangled with the rest of the wave function of the universe""; it happens extremely quickly but not instantaneously, and we don't know whether it happens everywhere at once at the same time, or propagates outward at the speed of light; and it happens because things near each other in spacetime simply tend to become entangled with each other, which is in a sense what we _mean_ by ""near each other in spacetime"".

In Spontaneous Collapse interpretations, the answers are instead, ""By decoherence we mean that there is some 'critical point' of entanglement at which the wave function of the system you're interested in _really does collapse_ into a definite observational outcome, but this _does not_ depend on 'consciousness' or 'observers', but rather just happens all the time""; it happens at inherently unpredictable time intervals related to the complexity of the system and its environment and the entanglements therein, with specific theories having very different answers for how often that tends to occur; and it happens because of similar reasons to what I stated above for Many Worlds.

Theories that utilize decoherence tend to be ones that treat the wave function as inherently and fundamentally real. But it isn't enough to _only_ say ""decoherence solves the measurement problem""; you have to go into a little more depth than that, just like if you're building a bridge you have to decide what kind of truss you'll use, where it goes, and what kinds of forces you intend for it to deal with, i.e. under-truss, over-truss, trussed arches beneath the bridge, a bridge suspended from a trussed arch, etc.",1,UgyrE5qmfzMC3UNhO-R4AaABAg,[]

If this is the case, then I don't see how any explanation other than many-worlds could make any sense. I think what I was missing from the other lectures of yours that I've seen is that there is a sort of propagating conditional probability getting built from the microscopic up to the macroscopic so that the worlds where the particle was in each possible location will have become sufficiently distinct so that a macroscopic observer could only ever observe it as a point.",1,UgyLgoNEHh8HcR_GHbV4AaABAg,[]

(If you fully understand all the nuances of the jargon he used, like 'operator', 'state', 'observable', and 'property', I can't say he's 'incorrect', but as with most things in modern science, the answer just isn't that simple.) Position and momentum are definitely _not_ properties, but rather observational outcomes we assign names to. As for spin, charge, mass (meaning fundamental Higgs-derived mass, which is less than 1% of your mass), color charge, etc... that's not something we really 'know' in any meaningful way.

We don't even know *what* ""an electron"" actually is, for example. We can describe it as ""a fundamental particle of mass = 0.511 MeV, electrical charge = -1, color charge = 0, and spin = ¬±1/2"", but are those ""properties""? Or just more observational outcomes? Frankly, we don't know. We can't even answer the questions ""Does an electron have a non-zero size, or is it a point mass?"" and ""If it has non-zero size, is it a little sphere, is it a little loop of string, is it one end of a string whose bulk is in curled-up extra dimensions, or is it a little winky-tongue emoji left as an easter-egg by the programmer of this simulation?"" So given that we can't answer the question ""what is an electron?"", we _definitely_ cannot answer ""what is 'spin', and is it a property or an observable?"" I've heard respected physicists describe an electron's spin as ""literally like the angular momentum of a spinning ball, but it can only take on two values because reasons"", or as ""nothing like the angular momentum of a spinning ball, in fact it's best to think of it sort of like a fundamental property of the electron as a hyper-sphere in four-or-higher-dimensional space"", or as ""basically a description of one vibrational mode of the string that makes up the electron"", or, perhaps most commonly, ""who cares what it is, it creates a magnetic moment of -9.3*10^-24 J/T, now shut up and calculate"".

So to say with confidence that ""all quantum properties can be described by a wavefunction"" is a bit bold, to me. After all, in many of the most compelling interpretations of QM, even the meaning of ""a wavefunction"" isn't at all clear (such as in Everettian QM in which there is only _one_ wave function: that of the entire universe, including all of its branches).",1,UgwA0NeM4vySRP_0myd4AaABAg,[]

Maybe I should ask them...

Seeker how about expanding your field of coverage with experimental scientific theories that base itself on cutting edge quantum physics knowledge we know or experience today or even can't explain today since we rely on observed pyshical phenomenons...

First, your model is not falsifiable,  but that doesn't made it true automatically. Second is a form of extreme solipsism, where you neglect almost all reality because our brain and senses works to interpret the material medium. In that manner, why are physical measurements that are not related with our natural perception but are already true? why something that is immeasurable via classical methods or via our senses should be more valid than a thing that are far away of our normal experiences?
This is a weird form of extreme skepticism, it's clear that our <<physical body>> has limitations on how senses the world, so we must to believe, at least in some manner to our senses. So, if our world is a build from the brain and their interpretations, why there are phenomena that is not intuitive, but true, like the relativistic mechanics (that is a classical theory) or the quantum mechanics that is so unique that is not common to anybody, but there are consensus over their existence. The weird part comes from that you neglect the classical part, that is <<natural>> and know to our common experiences, for the quantum one that is all but non intuitive. 
In another part, one of the first thing that you study on quantum mechanics, its that most of the phenomena  appears on certain conditions, very low temperatures, high energies, involving a lot of bodies on certain medium, or at very low scales, so also when you do the math, the results usually tends to the classical limit. [The quantization of the system occur only if the system has any kind of physical restriction.] (The experiments presented in this video are very interesting to me, because is a kind of hiatus in the frontier of quantum an classical world, a sort of change of phase.) 
Also there is a problem with the analogy between computers and biology, because a difference of the computers, the biological systems have a more intricate form-function relation. 
In other hand, a classical theory is less valid than a classical one? No, because there are their respective fields of application where both theories are successful, why you want, for example, use  relativistic fluid dynamics to build the pipes system of your home, when is enough using a basic set of classical fluids formulas to do the work, is like use a sword on a surgery, it's not the tool needed. The interesting things happen there the models begin to show failures, in that case we need to develop a new set of tools to have a more complete description of the phenomena, but ultimately must cover and lead to the same results on the already know. 
There's more, if you don't believe in things, but you believe in your model, then you contradict yourself. 

In this sense, i recommend both, the lecture of <<Fashionable Nonsense>> from Sokal, at least their epilogue, where are described certain recommendations  about when and when not is valid to use certain scientific language. I'm not a science's philosopher, to go deeper in this themes, but in not of the idea of been a skeptic extremist nor a ingenuous been.

Look up how magic tricks are performed and the psychology they employ and you will have your answer.

Science of any kind is an ever evolving thing and most things you learn in science are technically hypotheses... not laws of nature. COULD things we think are facts be proved false in 100 years?

So an Object only ""Radiates"" heat if it's Environment is colder than the object.

Regarding the Experiment Mentioned in the Video. They measured the Heat of the Entire System, in Classical mechanics that would be All objects, and the Medium they're in(Such as Air).

Thank you for the amazing explanation. 
However, I was expecting more elaboration on the kernel matrix interpretation.
The kernel plotting doesn't seem obvious to me. It is a 2D plotting, where is the increased dimension? And do the colors encode different features?",0,,[]
