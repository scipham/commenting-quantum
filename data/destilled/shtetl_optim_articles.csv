But if experience has taught me anything, it’s that the quantum hype train never slows down. In the past 24 hours, at least four people have emailed to ask me about a new paper entitled “Factoring integers with sublinear resources on a superconducting quantum processor.” Even the security expert Bruce Schneier, while skeptical, took the paper surprisingly seriously.
The paper claims … well, it’s hard to pin down what it claims, but it’s certainly given many people the impression that there’s been a decisive advance on how to factor huge integers, and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem, using a near-term quantum computer. Not by using Shor’s Algorithm, mind you, but by using the deceptively similarly named Schnorr’s Algorithm. The latter is a classical algorithm based on lattices, which the authors then “enhance” using the heuristic quantum optimization method called QAOA.
For those who don’t care to read further, here is my 3-word review:
No. Just No.
And here’s my slightly longer review:
Schnorr ≠ Shor. Yes, even when Schnorr’s algorithm is dubiously “enhanced” using QAOA—a quantum algorithm that, incredibly, for all the hundreds of papers written about it, has not yet been convincingly argued to yield any speedup for any problem whatsoever (besides, as it were, the problem of reproducing its own pattern of errors) (one possible recent exception from Sami Boulebnane and Ashley Montanaro).
In the new paper, the authors spend page after page saying-without-saying that it might soon become possible to break RSA-2048, using a NISQ (i.e., non-fault-tolerant) quantum computer. They do so via two time-tested strategems:
- the detailed exploration of irrelevancies (mostly, optimization of the number of qubits, while ignoring the number of gates), and
- complete silence about the one crucial point.
Then, finally, they come clean about the one crucial point in a single sentence of the Conclusion section:
It should be pointed out that the quantum speedup of the algorithm is unclear due to the ambiguous convergence of QAOA.
“Unclear” is an understatement here. It seems to me that a miracle would be required for the approach here to yield any benefit at all, compared to just running the classical Schnorr’s algorithm on your laptop. And if the latter were able to break RSA, it would’ve already done so.
All told, this is one of the most actively misleading quantum computing papers I’ve seen in 25 years, and I’ve seen … many. Having said that, this actually isn’t the first time I’ve encountered the strange idea that the exponential quantum speedup for factoring integers, which we know about from Shor’s algorithm, should somehow “rub off” onto quantum optimization heuristics that embody none of the actual insights of Shor’s algorithm, as if by sympathetic magic. Since this idea needs a name, I’d hereby like to propose Cargo Cult Quantum Factoring.
And with that, I feel I’ve adequately discharged my duties here to sanity and truth.

1,6871,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6871,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2022-12-02,Scott Aaronson,"Google’s Sycamore chip: no wormholes, no superfast classical simulation either","Update (Dec. 6): I’m having a blast at the Workshop on Spacetime and Quantum Information at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. I’m learning a huge amount from the talks and discussions here—and also simply enjoying being back in Princeton, to see old friends and visit old haunts like the Bent Spoon. Tomorrow I’ll speak about my recent work with Jason Pollack on polynomial-time AdS bulk reconstruction. [New: click here for video of my talk!]
But there’s one thing, relevant to this post, that I can’t let pass without comment. Tonight, David Nirenberg, Director of the IAS and a medieval historian, gave an after-dinner speech to our workshop, centered around how auspicious it was that the workshop was being held a mere week after the momentous announcement of a holographic wormhole on a microchip (!!)—a feat that experts were calling the first-ever laboratory investigation of quantum gravity, and a new frontier for experimental physics itself. Nirenberg asked whether, a century from now, people might look back on the wormhole achievement as today we look back on Eddington’s 1919 eclipse observations providing the evidence for general relativity.
I confess: this was the first time I felt visceral anger, rather than mere bemusement, over this wormhole affair. Before, I had implicitly assumed: no one was actually hoodwinked by this. No one really, literally believed that this little 9-qubit simulation opened up a wormhole, or helped prove the holographic nature of the real universe, or anything like that. I was wrong.
To be clear, I don’t blame Professor Nirenberg at all. If I were a medieval historian, everything he said about the experiment’s historic significance might strike me as perfectly valid inferences from what I’d read in the press. I don’t blame the It from Qubit community—most of which, I can report, was grinding its teeth and turning red in the face right alongside me. I don’t even blame most of the authors of the wormhole paper, such as Daniel Jafferis, who gave a perfectly sober, reasonable, technical talk at the workshop about how he and others managed to compress a simulation of a variant of the SYK model into a mere 9 qubits—a talk that eschewed all claims of historic significance and of literal wormhole creation.
But it’s now clear to me that, between
(1) the It from Qubit community that likes to explore speculative ideas like holographic wormholes, and
(2) the lay news readers who are now under the impression that Google just did one of the greatest physics experiments of all time,
something went terribly wrong—something that risks damaging trust in the scientific process itself. And I think it’s worth reflecting on what we can do to prevent it from happening again.
This is going to be one of the many Shtetl-Optimized posts that I didn’t feel like writing, but was given no choice but to write.
News, social media, and my inbox have been abuzz with two claims about Google’s Sycamore quantum processor, the one that now has 72 superconducting qubits.
The first claim is that Sycamore created a wormhole (!)—a historic feat possible only with a quantum computer. See for example the New York Times and Quanta and Ars Technica and Nature (and of course, the actual paper), as well as Peter Woit’s blog and Chad Orzel’s blog.
The second claim is that Sycamore’s pretensions to quantum supremacy have been refuted. The latter claim is based on this recent preprint by Dorit Aharonov, Xun Gao, Zeph Landau, Yunchao Liu, and Umesh Vazirani. No one—least of all me!—doubts that these authors have proved a strong new technical result, solving a significant open problem in the theory of noisy random circuit sampling. On the other hand, it might be less obvious how to interpret their result and put it in context. See also a YouTube video of Yunchao speaking about the new result at this week’s Simons Institute Quantum Colloquium, and of a panel discussion afterwards, where Yunchao, Umesh Vazirani, Adam Bouland, Sergio Boixo, and your humble blogger discuss what it means.
On their face, the two claims about Sycamore might seem to be in tension. After all, if Sycamore can’t do anything beyond what a classical computer can do, then how exactly did it bend the topology of spacetime?
I submit that neither claim is true. On the one hand, Sycamore did not “create a wormhole.” On the other hand, it remains pretty hard to simulate with a classical computer, as far as anyone knows. To summarize, then, our knowledge of what Sycamore can and can’t do remains much the same as last week or last month!
Let’s start with the wormhole thing. I can’t really improve over how I put it in Dennis Overbye’s NYT piece:
“The most important thing I’d want New York Times readers to understand is this,” Scott Aaronson, a quantum computing expert at the University of Texas in Austin, wrote in an email. “If this experiment has brought a wormhole into actual physical existence, then a strong case could be made that you, too, bring a wormhole into actual physical existence every time you sketch one with pen and paper.”
More broadly, Overbye’s NYT piece explains with admirable clarity what this experiment did and didn’t do—leaving only the question “wait … if that’s all that’s going on here, then why is it being written up in the NYT??” This is a rare case where, in my opinion, the NYT did a much better job than Quanta, which unequivocally accepted and amplified the “QC creates a wormhole” framing.
Alright, but what’s the actual basis for the “QC creates a wormhole” claim, for those who don’t want to leave this blog to read about it? Well, the authors used 9 of Sycamore’s 72 qubits to do a crude simulation of something called the SYK (Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev) model. SYK has become popular as a toy model for quantum gravity. In particular, it has a holographic dual description, which can indeed involve a spacetime with one or more wormholes. So, they ran a quantum circuit that crudely modelled the SYK dual of a scenario with information sent through a wormhole. They then confirmed that the circuit did what it was supposed to do—i.e., what they’d already classically calculated that it would do.
So, the objection is obvious: if someone simulates a black hole on their classical computer, they don’t say they thereby “created a black hole.” Or if they do, journalists don’t uncritically repeat the claim. Why should the standards be different just because we’re talking about a quantum computer rather than a classical one?
Did we at least learn anything new about SYK wormholes from the simulation? Alas, not really, because 9 qubits take a mere 29=512 complex numbers to specify their wavefunction, and are therefore trivial to simulate on a laptop. There’s some argument in the paper that, if the simulation were scaled up to (say) 100 qubits, then maybe we would learn something new about SYK. Even then, however, we’d mostly learn about certain corrections that arise because the simulation was being done with “only” n=100 qubits, rather than in the n→∞ limit where SYK is rigorously understood. But while those corrections, arising when n is “neither too large nor too small,” would surely be interesting to specialists, they’d have no obvious bearing on the prospects for creating real physical wormholes in our universe.
And yet, this is not a sensationalistic misunderstanding invented by journalists. Some prominent quantum gravity theorists themselves—including some of my close friends and collaborators—persist in talking about the simulated SYK wormhole as “actually being” a wormhole. What are they thinking?
Daniel Harlow explained the thinking to me as follows (he stresses that he’s explaining it, not necessarily endorsing it). If you had two entangled quantum computers, one on Earth and the other in the Andromeda galaxy, and if they were both simulating SYK, and if Alice on Earth and Bob in Andromeda both uploaded their own brains into their respective quantum simulations, then it seems possible that the simulated Alice and Bob could have the experience of jumping into a wormhole and meeting each other in the middle. Granted, they couldn’t get a message back out from the wormhole, at least not without “going the long way,” which could happen only at the speed of light—so only simulated-Alice and simulated-Bob themselves could ever test this prediction. Nevertheless, if true, I suppose some would treat it as grounds for regarding a quantum simulation of SYK as “more real” or “more wormholey” than a classical simulation.
Of course, this scenario depends on strong assumptions not merely about quantum gravity, but also about the metaphysics of consciousness! And I’d still prefer to call it a simulated wormhole for simulated people.
For completeness, here’s Harlow’s passage from the NYT article:
Daniel Harlow, a physicist at M.I.T. who was not involved in the experiment, noted that the experiment was based on a model of quantum gravity that was so simple, and unrealistic, that it could just as well have been studied using a pencil and paper.
“So I’d say that this doesn’t teach us anything about quantum gravity that we didn’t already know,” Dr. Harlow wrote in an email. “On the other hand, I think it is exciting as a technical achievement, because if we can’t even do this (and until now we couldn’t), then simulating more interesting quantum gravity theories would CERTAINLY be off the table.” Developing computers big enough to do so might take 10 or 15 years, he added.
Alright, let’s move on to the claim that quantum supremacy has been refuted. What Aharonov et al. actually show in their new work, building on earlier work by Gao and Duan, is that Random Circuit Sampling, with a constant rate of noise per gate and no error-correction, can’t provide a scalable approach to quantum supremacy. Or more precisely: as the number of qubits n goes to infinity, and assuming you’re in the “anti-concentration regime” (which in practice probably means: the depth of your quantum circuit is at least ~log(n)), there’s a classical algorithm to approximately sample the quantum circuit’s output distribution in poly(n) time (albeit, not yet a practical algorithm).
Here’s what’s crucial to understand: this is 100% consistent with what those of us working on quantum supremacy had assumed since at least 2016! We knew that if you tried to scale Random Circuit Sampling to 200 or 500 or 1000 qubits, while you also increased the circuit depth proportionately, the signal-to-noise ratio would become exponentially small, meaning that your quantum speedup would disappear. That’s why, from the very beginning, we targeted the “practical” regime of 50-100 qubits: a regime where
- you can still see explicitly that you’re exploiting a 250– or 2100-dimensional Hilbert space for computational advantage, thereby confirming one of the main predictions of quantum computing theory, but
- you also have a signal that (as it turned out) is large enough to see with heroic effort.
To their credit, Aharonov et al. explain all this perfectly clearly in their abstract and introduction. I’m just worried that others aren’t reading their paper as carefully as they should be!
So then, what’s the new advance in the Aharonov et al. paper? Well, there had been some hope that circuit depth ~log(n) might be a sweet spot, where an exponential quantum speedup might both exist and survive constant noise, even in the asymptotic limit of n→∞ qubits. Nothing in Google’s or USTC’s actual Random Circuit Sampling experiments depended on that hope, but it would’ve been nice if it were true. What Aharonov et al. have now done is to kill that hope, using powerful techniques involving summing over Feynman paths in the Pauli basis.
Stepping back, what is the current status of quantum supremacy based on Random Circuit Sampling? I would say it’s still standing, but more precariously than I’d like—underscoring the need for new and better quantum supremacy experiments. In more detail, Pan, Chen, and Zhang have shown how to simulate Google’s 53-qubit Sycamore chip classically, using what I estimated to be 100-1000X the electricity cost of running the quantum computer itself (including the dilution refrigerator!). Approaching from the problem from a different angle, Gao et al. have given a polynomial-time classical algorithm for spoofing Google’s Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (LXEB)—but their algorithm can currently achieve only about 10% of the excess in LXEB that Google’s experiment found.
So, though it’s been under sustained attack from multiple directions these past few years, I’d say that the flag of quantum supremacy yet waves. The Extended Church-Turing Thesis is still on thin ice. The wormhole is still open. Wait … no … that’s not what I meant to write…

2,6830,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6830,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2022-11-23,Scott Aaronson,Dismantling Quantum Hype with Tim Nguyen,"Happy Thanksgiving to my American readers! While I enjoy a family holiday-week vacation in exotic Dallas—and yes, I will follow up on my old JFK post by visiting Dealey Plaza—please enjoy the following Thanksgiving victuals:
I recently recorded a 3-hour (!) YouTube video with Timothy Nguyen, host of the Cartesian Cafe. Our episode is entitled Quantum Computing: Dismantling the Hype. In it, I teach a sort of extremely compressed version of my undergraduate Intro to Quantum Information Science course, unburdening myself about whatever Tim prompts me to explain: the basic rules of quantum information, quantum circuits, the quantum black-box model, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, BQP and its relationship to classical complexity classes, and sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments. This is a lot more technical than an average podcast, a lot less technical than an actual course, and hopefully just right for some nonempty subset of readers.
Outside of his podcasting career, some of you might recognize Nguyen as the coauthor, with Theo Polya, of a rebuttal of “Geometric Unity.” This latter is the proposal by the financier, podcaster, and leading “Intellectual Dark Web” figure Eric Weinstein for a unified theory of particle physics. Now, I slightly know Weinstein, and have even found him fascinating, eloquent, and correct about various issues. So, in an addendum to the main video, Nguyen chats with me about his experience critiquing Weinstein’s theory, and also about something where my knowledge is far greater: namely, my 2002 rebuttal of some of the central claims in Stephen Wolfram’s A New Kind of Science, and whether there are any updates to that story twenty years later.

3,6784,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6784,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2022-10-31,Scott Aaronson,"Oh right, quantum computing","These days, I often need to remind myself that, as an undergrad, grad student, postdoc, or professor, I’ve now been doing quantum computing research for a quarter-century—i.e., well over half of the subject’s existence. As a direct result, when I feel completely jaded about a new development in QC, it might actually be exciting. When I feel moderately excited, it might actually be the most exciting thing for years.
With that in mind:
(1) Last week National Public Radio’s Marketplace interviewed me, John Martinis, and others about the current state of quantum computing. While the piece wasn’t entirely hype-free, I’m pleased to report that my own views were represented accurately! To wit:
“There is a tsunami of hype about what quantum computers are going to revolutionize,” said Scott Aaronson, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin. “Quantum computing has turned into a word that venture capitalists or people seeking government funding will sprinkle on anything because it sounds good.”
Aaronson warned we can’t be certain that these computers will in fact revolutionize machine learning and finance and optimization problems. “We can’t prove that there’s not a quantum algorithm that solves all these problems super fast, but we can’t even prove there’s not an algorithm for a conventional computer that does it,” he said. [In the recorded version, they replaced this by a simpler but also accurate thought: namely, that we can’t prove one way or the other whether there’s a useful quantum advantage for these tasks.]
(2) I don’t like to use this blog to toot my own research horn, but on Thursday my postdoc Jason Pollack and I released a paper, entitled Discrete Bulk Reconstruction. And to be honest, I’m pretty damned excited about it. It represents about 8 months of Jason—a cosmologist and string theorist who studied under Sean Carroll—helping me understand AdS/CFT in the language of the undergraduate CS curriculum, like min-cuts on undirected graphs, so that we could then look for polynomial-time algorithms to implement the holographic mapping from boundary quantum states to the spatial geometry in the bulk. We drew heavily on previous work in the same direction, especially the already-seminal 2015 holographic entropy cone paper by Ning Bao et al. But I’d like to think that, among other things, our work represents a new frontier in just how accessible AdS/CFT itself can be made to CS and discrete math types. Anyway, here’s the abstract if you’re interested:
According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the geometries of certain spacetimes are fully determined by quantum states that live on their boundaries — indeed, by the von Neumann entropies of portions of those boundary states. This work investigates to what extent the geometries can be reconstructed from the entropies in polynomial time. Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani (2019) argued that the AdS/CFT map can be exponentially complex if one wants to reconstruct regions such as the interiors of black holes. Our main result provides a sort of converse: we show that, in the special case of a single 1D boundary, if the input data consists of a list of entropies of contiguous boundary regions, and if the entropies satisfy a single inequality called Strong Subadditivity, then we can construct a graph model for the bulk in linear time. Moreover, the bulk graph is planar, it has O(N2) vertices (the information-theoretic minimum), and it’s “universal,” with only the edge weights depending on the specific entropies in question. From a combinatorial perspective, our problem boils down to an “inverse” of the famous min-cut problem: rather than being given a graph and asked to find a min-cut, here we’re given the values of min-cuts separating various sets of vertices, and need to find a weighted undirected graph consistent with those values. Our solution to this problem relies on the notion of a “bulkless” graph, which might be of independent interest for AdS/CFT. We also make initial progress on the case of multiple 1D boundaries — where the boundaries could be connected via wormholes — including an upper bound of O(N4) vertices whenever a planar bulk graph exists (thus putting the problem into the complexity class NP).
(3) Anand Natarajan and Chinmay Nirkhe posted a preprint entitled A classical oracle separation between QMA and QCMA, which makes progress on a problem that’s been raised on this blog all the way back to its inception. A bit of context: QMA, Quantum Merlin-Arthur, captures what can be proven using a quantum state with poly(n) qubits as the proof, and a polynomial-time quantum algorithm as the verifier. QCMA, or Quantum Classical Merlin-Arthur, is the same as QMA except that now the proof has to be classical. A fundamental problem of quantum complexity theory, first raised by Aharonov and Naveh in 2002, is whether QMA=QCMA. In 2007, Greg Kuperberg and I introduced the concept of quantum oracle separation—that is, a unitary that can be applied in a black-box manner—in order to show that there’s a quantum oracle relative to which QCMA≠QMA. In 2015, Fefferman and Kimmel improved this, to show that there’s a “randomized in-place” oracle relative to which QCMA≠QMA. Natarajan and Nirkhe now remove the “in-place” part, meaning the only thing still “wrong” with their oracle is that it’s randomized. Derandomizing their construction would finally settle this 20-year-old open problem (except, of course, for the minor detail of whether QMA=QCMA in the “real,” unrelativized world!).

I don’t personally know Aspect or Clauser, but Zeilinger extremely graciously hosted me and my wife Dana when we visited Vienna in 2012, even bringing us to the symphony (he knows the director and has front-row seats), and somehow making me feel more cultured rather than less.
As usual, the recipe for winning the Nobel Prize in Physics is this:
(1) Do something where anyone who knows about it is like, “why haven’t they given the Nobel Prize in Physics for that yet?”
(2) Live long enough.
Huge congratulations to Aspect, Clauser, and Zeilinger!
Elham Kashefi, my quantum complexity theory colleague and treasured friend for more than 20 years, brought to my attention a Statement of Solidarity with Students in Iran from the International Academic Community.

I urge you to sign the statement as well. If enough Shtetl-Optimized readers disapprove of their brutal repression, surely the mullahs will reconsider!

5,6685,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6685,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2022-08-31,Scott Aaronson,My Quantum Information Science II Lecture Notes: The wait is over!,"They’re 155 pages of awesome—for a certain extremely specific definition of “awesome”—which I’m hereby offering to the world free of charge (for noncommercial use only, of course). They cover material that I taught, for the first time, in my Introduction to Quantum Information Science II undergrad course at UT Austin in Spring 2022.
The new notes pick up exactly where my older QIS I lecture notes left off, and they presuppose familiarity with the QIS I material. So, if you’re just beginning your quantum information journey, then please start with my QIS I notes, which presuppose only linear algebra and a bit of classical algorithms (e.g., recurrence relations and big-O notation), and which self-containedly explain all the rules of QM, moving on to (e.g.) quantum circuits, density matrices, entanglement entropy, Wiesner’s quantum money, QKD, quantum teleportation, the Bell inequality, interpretations of QM, the Shor 9-qubit code, and the algorithms of Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon, Shor, and Grover. Master all that, and you’ll be close to the quantum information research frontier of circa 1996.
My new QIS II notes cover a bunch of topics, but the main theme is “perspectives on quantum computing that go beyond the bare quantum circuit model, and that became increasingly central to the field from the late 1990s onwards.” Thus, it covers:
- Hamiltonians, ground states, the adiabatic algorithm, and the universality of adiabatic QC
- The stabilizer formalism, the 1996 Gottesman-Knill Theorem on efficient classical simulation of stabilizer QC, my and Gottesman’s 2004 elaborations, boosting up to universality via “magic states,” transversal codes, and the influential 2016 concept of stabilizer rank
- Bosons and fermions: the formalism of Fock space and of creation and annihilation operators, connection to the permanents and determinants of matrices, efficient classical simulation of free fermionic systems (Valiant’s 2002 “matchcircuits”), the 2001 Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) theorem on universal optical QC, BosonSampling and its computational complexity, and the current experimental status of BosonSampling
- Cluster states, Raussendorf and Briegel’s 2000 measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), and Gottesman and Chuang’s 1999 “gate teleportation” trick
- Matrix product states, and Vidal’s 2003 efficient classical simulation of “slightly entangled” quantum computations
Extra bonus topics include:
- The 2007 Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi (BFK) protocol for blind and authenticated QC; brief discussion of later developments including Reichardt-Unger-Vazirani 2012 and Mahadev 2018
- Basic protocols for quantum state tomography
- My 2007 work on PAC-learnability of quantum states
- The “dessert course”: the black hole information problem, and the Harlow-Hayden argument on the computational hardness of decoding Hawking radiation
Master all this, and hopefully you’ll have the conceptual vocabulary to understand a large fraction of what people in quantum computing and information care about today, how they now think about building scalable QCs, and what they post to the quant-ph arXiv.
Note that my QIS II course is complementary to my graduate course on quantum complexity theory, for which the lecture notes are here. There’s very little overlap between the two (and even less overlap between QIS II and Quantum Computing Since Democritus).
The biggest, most important topic related to the QIS II theme that I didn’t cover was topological quantum computing. I’d wanted to, but it quickly became clear that topological QC begs for a whole course of its own, and that I had neither the time nor the expertise to do it justice. In retrospect, I do wish I’d at least covered the Kitaev surface code.
Crucially, these lecture notes don’t represent my effort alone. I worked from draft scribe notes prepared by the QIS II students, who did a far better job than I had any right to expect (including creating the beautiful figures). My wonderful course TA and PhD student Daniel Liang, along with students Ethan Tan, Samuel Ziegelbein, and Steven Han, then assembled everything, fixed numerous errors, and compiled the bibliography. I’m grateful to all of them. At the last minute, we had a LaTeX issue that none of us knew how to fix—but, in response to a plea, Shtetl-Optimized reader Pablo Cingolani generously volunteered to help, completed the work by the very next day (I’d imagined it taking a month!), and earned a fruit basket from me in gratitude.
Anyway, let me know of any mistakes you find!

Thanks for the kind words about my blog, and for your piece, which I just read. There’s a great deal of truth in what you write, but I also take issue with a few points. You say:
A convincing strategy for overcoming these errors has not yet been demonstrated, making it unclear as to when — if ever — it will become possible to build a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer.
In one sense this is tautologically true — the only fully convincing and clear demonstration that something is possible is to do it, as with the Wright brothers or the Trinity nuclear test. In other sense, though, we’ve known the “strategy” since the 1990s. It’s just that the fault-tolerance theorem called for gate fidelities 5-6 orders of magnitude better than anything achievable at the time. In the 25 years since, about 3 of those orders of magnitude have been achieved, so it doesn’t take any great imagination to foresee that the remainder could be as well. A layperson reading your piece might not understand this.
As for applications, my position has always been that if there were zero applications, it would still be at least as scientifically important to try to build QCs as it was to build the LHC, LIGO, or the James Webb telescope. If there are real applications, such as simulating chemical dynamics, or certifiable randomness — and there very well might be — then those are icing on the cake. This, of course, radically differs from the vision that now gets presented to investors and the press (hence all the railing on my blog!), but it also differs from what a reader of your piece would take away.
Anyway, thanks again for sharing!
Best,

The notes will be freely shared on this blog. But the bibliographies for the various lectures need to be merged, and we don’t know how. Would any TeXpert like to help us, in exchange for a generous acknowledgment? A reader named Pablo Cingolani has now graciously taken care of this. Thanks so much, Pablo!
I returned last week from the NSF Workshop on Quantum Advantage and Next Steps at the University of Chicago. Thanks so much to Chicago CS professor (and my former summer student) Bill Fefferman and the other organizers for making this workshop a reality. Given how vividly I remember the situation 12 years ago, when the idea of sampling-based quantum supremacy was the weird obsession of me and a few others, it was particularly special to attend a workshop on the topic with well over a hundred participants, some in-person and some on Zoom, delayed by covid but still excited by the dramatic experimental progress of the past few years.
Of course there’s a lot still to do. Many of the talks drew an exclamation point on something I’ve been saying for the past couple years: that there’s an urgent need for better quantum supremacy experiments, which will require both theoretical and engineering advances. The experiments by Google and USTC and now Xanadu represent a big step forward for the field, but since they started being done, the classical spoofing attacks have also steadily improved, to the point that whether “quantum computational supremacy” still exists depends on exactly how you define it.
Briefly: if you measure by total operations, energy use, or CO2 footprint, then probably yes, quantum supremacy remains. But if you measure by number of seconds, then it doesn’t remain, not if you’re willing to shell out for enough cores on AWS or your favorite supercomputer. And even the quantum supremacy that does remain might eventually fall to, e.g., further improvements of the algorithm due to Gao et al. For more details, see, e.g., the now-published work of Pan, Chen, and Zhang, or this good popular summary by Adrian Cho for Science.
If the experimentalists care enough, they could easily regain the quantum lead, at least for a couple more years, by (say) repeating random circuit sampling with 72 qubits rather than 53-60, and hopefully circuit depth of 30-40 rather than just 20-25. But the point I made in my talk was that, as long as we remain in the paradigm of sampling experiments that take ~2n time to verify classically and also ~2n time to spoof classically (where n is the number of qubits), all quantum speedups that we can achieve will be fragile and contingent, however interesting and impressive. As soon as we go way beyond what classical computers can keep up with, we’ve also gone way beyond where classical computers can check what was done.
I argued that the only solution to this problem is to design new quantum supremacy experiments: ones where some secret has been inserted in the quantum circuit that lets a classical computer efficiently verify the results. The fundamental problem is that we need three properties—
- implementability on near-term quantum computers,
- efficient classical verifiability, and
- confidence that quantum computers have a theoretical asymptotic advantage,
and right now we only know how to get any two out of the three. We can get 1 and 2 with QAOA and various other heuristic quantum algorithms, 1 and 3 with BosonSampling and Random Circuit Sampling, or 2 and 3 with Shor’s algorithm or Yamakawa-Zhandry or recent interactive protocols. To get all three, there are three obvious approaches:
- Start with the heuristic algorithms and find a real advantage from them,
- Start with BosonSampling or Random Circuit Sampling or the like and figure out how to make them efficiently verifiable classically, or
- Start with protocols like Kahanamoku-Meyer et al.’s and figure out how to run them on near-term devices.
At the Chicago workshop, I’d say that the most popular approach speakers talked about was 3, although my own focus was more on 2.
Anyway, until a “best-of-all-worlds” quantum supremacy experiment is discovered, there’s plenty to do in the meantime: for example, better understand the classical hardness of spoofing Random Circuit Sampling with a constant or logarithmic number of gate layers. Understand the best that classical algorithms can do to spoof the Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark for BosonSampling, and build on Grier et al. to understand the power of BosonSampling with a linear number of modes.
I’ll be flying back with my family to Austin today after seven weeks at the Jersey shore, but I’ll try to field any questions about the state of quantum supremacy in general or this workshop in particular in the comments!",4882,"['8391457244493b071b1bf674e2d569cff583722b7a7f12602c11c4f4bae40dff', '605910cf93ca0c26799f1f441c4138f0c7c6d67af6652ebd45bca5db913522b6', '7b01a931784fc794e433503243935ea81920b807465e3fceda098389fcb20349', 'ada911b260ae3ceda78b5864f4a57763ad7145eb6feec3d971751ebab81bec41', 'f4f635fdabae03baf52317b3e5d339810399b89f5db83e8186d06bdfe509080d', 'f47950fb11f9bb6fe5585628fe27d989df27cb35b40d5b26e8a5dfd17d643f57', 'a5ab8f56320620f3470906b59561606dd4aa68dd4204b3f38d8641aa154ca551', '4ba7c68238255f3c3c57c6b0a11f4fc63172ea4236f0149b454f6be14a32a65d', '277b19a17e029fee5b7c53268f8605b74c1cc9592bd2667dcdc60f45ee3f6783', 'd2eb5a938257c812fb19d8308b392c95f30a6234bcb78ef7c3e9a3b8fae86492', '062f5b1746f82fff9d0eb7003a6c44bc44532c33a71e03719bbba2b21ed41e7f', '62518a380beabebc0deb81cf2b4550f98781f8368907c9075138687e33a56e52', '0261c4a7efa794990c21b3b8cf674c460936e4c3cea2b4b58edaa04ae8a2e2b9', '388d62bf6ac51f84d197c58a1040e64cc25c7d663e6aef458e9c6ce1bde7d296', 'ff92966c75d4e656d708d906026c9f6ea28a2e56afe095b0d38e8fdf6612381d', 'd7cf0cbe89539c550f68b315336439b7374ee5eee761cfe9e4fc965e2aa0e54b']"

Not much new for regular readers, but I’m very happy with how it came out—thanks so much to Robert Davis and Olivia Lanes for making it happen! My only quibble is with the sketch of my face, which might create the inaccurate impression that I no longer have teeth.
- Boaz Barak pointed me to a Twitter thread of DALL-E paintings of people using quantum computers, in the styles of many of history’s famous artists. While the motifs are unsurprising (QCs look like regular computers but glowing, or maybe like giant glowing atoms), highly recommended as another demonstration of the sort of thing DALL-E does best.
- Dan Spielman asked me to announce that the National Academy of Sciences is seeking nominations for the Held Prize in combinatorial and discrete optimization. The deadline is October 3.
- I’m at the NSF Workshop on Quantum Advantage and Next Steps at the University of Chicago. My talk yesterday was entitled “Verifiable Quantum Advantage: What I Hope Will Be Done” (yeah yeah, I decided to call it “advantage” rather than “supremacy” in deference to the name of the workshop). My PowerPoint slides are here. Meanwhile, this morning was the BosonSampling session. The talk by Chaoyang Lu, leader of USTC’s experimental BosonSampling effort, was punctuated by numerous silly memes and videos, as well as the following striking sentence: “only by putting the seven dragon balls together can you unlock the true quantum computational power.”
- Gavin Leech lists and excerpts his favorite writings of mine over the past 25 years, while complaining that I spend “a lot of time rebutting fleeting manias” and “obsess[ing] over political flotsam.”

I promise you: this post is going to tell a scientifically coherent story that involves all five topics listed in the title. Not one can be omitted.
My story starts with a Zoom talk that the one and only Lenny Susskind delivered for the Simons Institute for Theory of Computing back in May. There followed a panel discussion involving Lenny, Edward Witten, Geoffrey Penington, Umesh Vazirani, and your humble shtetlmaster.
Lenny’s talk led up to a gedankenexperiment involving an observer, Alice, who bravely jumps into a specially-prepared black hole, in order to see the answer to a certain computational problem in her final seconds before being ripped to shreds near the singularity. Drawing on earlier work by Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani, Lenny speculated that the computational problem could be exponentially hard even for a (standard) quantum computer. Despite this, Lenny repeatedly insisted—indeed, he asked me again to stress here—that he was not claiming to violate the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis (QECTT), the statement that all of nature can be efficiently simulated by a standard quantum computer. Instead, he was simply investigating how the QECTT needs to be formulated in order to be a true statement.
I didn’t understand this, to put it mildly. If what Lenny was saying was right—i.e., if the infalling observer could see the answer to a computational problem not in BQP, or Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time—then why shouldn’t we call that a violation of the QECTT? Just like we call Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm a likely violation of the classical Extended Church-Turing Thesis, the thesis saying that nature can be efficiently simulated by a classical computer? Granted, you don’t have to die in order to run Shor’s algorithm, as you do to run Lenny’s experiment. But why should such implementation details matter from the lofty heights of computational complexity?
Alas, not only did Lenny never answer that in a way that made sense to me, he kept trying to shift the focus from real, physical black holes to “silicon spheres” made of qubits, which would be programmed to simulate the process of Alice jumping into the black hole (in a dual boundary description). Say what? Granting that Lenny’s silicon spheres, being quantum computers under another name, could clearly be simulated in BQP, wouldn’t this still leave the question about the computational powers of observers who jump into actual black holes—i.e., the question that we presumably cared about in the first place?
Confusing me even further, Witten seemed almost dismissive of the idea that Lenny’s gedankenexperiment raised any new issue for the QECTT—that is, any issue that wouldn’t already have been present in a universe without gravity. But as to Witten’s reasons, the most I understood from his remarks was that he was worried about various “engineering” issues with implementing Lenny’s gedankenexperiment, involving gravitational backreaction and the like. Ed Witten, now suddenly the practical guy! I couldn’t even isolate the crux of disagreement between Susskind and Witten, since after all, they agreed (bizarrely, from my perspective) that the QECTT wasn’t violated. Why wasn’t it?
Anyway, shortly afterward I attended the 28th Solvay Conference in Brussels, where one of the central benefits I got—besides seeing friends after a long COVID absence and eating some amazing chocolate mousse—was a dramatically clearer understanding of the issues in Lenny’s gedankenexperiment. I owe this improved understanding to conversations with many people at Solvay, but above all Daniel Gottesman and Daniel Harlow. Lenny himself wasn’t there, other than in spirit, but I ran the Daniels’ picture by him afterwards and he assented to all of its essentials.
The Daniels’ picture is what I want to explain in this post. Needless to say, I take sole responsibility for any errors in my presentation, as I also take sole responsibility for not understanding (or rather: not doing the work to translate into terms that I understood) what Susskind and Witten had said to me before.
The first thing you need to understand about Lenny’s gedankenexperiment is that it takes place entirely in the context of AdS/CFT: the famous holographic duality between two types of physical theories that look wildly different. Here AdS stands for anti-de-Sitter: a quantum theory of gravity describing a D-dimensional universe with a negative cosmological constant (i.e. hyperbolic geometry), one where black holes can form and evaporate and so forth. Meanwhile, CFT stands for conformal field theory: a quantum field theory, with no apparent gravity (and hence no black holes), that lives on the (D-1)-dimensional boundary of the D-dimensional AdS space. The staggering claim of AdS/CFT is that every physical question about the AdS bulk can be translated into an equivalent question about the CFT boundary, and vice versa, with a one-to-one mapping from states to states and observables to observables. So in that sense, they’re actually the same theory, just viewed in two radically different ways. AdS/CFT originally came out of string theory, but then notoriously “swallowed its parent,” to the point where nowadays, if you go to what are still called “string theory” meetings, you’re liable to hear vastly more discussion of AdS/CFT than of actual strings.
Thankfully, the story I want to tell won’t depend on fine details of how AdS/CFT works. Nevertheless, you can’t just ignore the AdS/CFT part as some technicality, in order to get on with the vivid tale of Alice jumping into a black hole, hoping to learn the answer to a beyond-BQP computational problem in her final seconds of existence. The reason you can’t ignore it is that the whole beyond-BQP computational problem we’ll be talking about, involves the translation (or “dictionary”) between the AdS bulk and the CFT boundary. If you like, then, it’s actually the chasm between bulk and boundary that plays the starring role in this story. The more familiar chasm within the bulk, between the interior of a black hole and its exterior (the two separated by an event horizon), plays only a subsidiary role: that of causing the AdS/CFT dictionary to become exponentially complex, as far as anyone can tell.
Pause for a minute. Previously I led you to believe that we’d be talking about an actual observer Alice, jumping into an actual physical black hole, and whether Alice could see the answer to a problem that’s intractable even for quantum computers in her last moments before hitting the singularity, and if so whether we should take that to refute the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis. What I’m saying now is so wildly at variance with that picture, that it had to be repeated to me about 10 times before I understood it. Once I did understand, I then had to repeat it to others about 10 times before they understood. And I don’t care if people ridicule me for that admission—how slow Scott and his friends must be, compared to string theorists!—because my only goal right now is to get you to understand it.
To say it again: Lenny has not proposed a way for Alice to surpass the complexity-theoretic power of quantum computers, even for a brief moment, by crossing the event horizon of a black hole. If that was Alice’s goal when she jumped into the black hole, then alas, she probably sacrificed her life for nothing! As far as anyone knows, Alice’s experiences, even after crossing the event horizon, ought to continue to be described extremely well by general relativity and quantum field theory (at least until she nears the singularity and dies), and therefore ought to be simulatable in BQP. Granted, we don’t actually know this—you can call it an open problem if you like—but it seems like a reasonable guess.
In that case, though, what beyond-BQP problem was Lenny talking about, and what does it have to do with black holes? Building on the Bouland-Fefferman-Vazirani paper, Lenny was interested in a class of problems of the following form: Alice is given as input a pure quantum state |ψ⟩, which encodes a boundary CFT state, which is dual to an AdS bulk universe that contains a black hole. Alice’s goal is, by examining |ψ⟩, to learn something about what’s inside the black hole. For example: does the black hole interior contain “shockwaves,” and if so how many and what kind? Does it contain a wormhole, connecting it to a different black hole in another universe? If so, what’s the volume of that wormhole? (Not the first question I would ask either, but bear with me.)
Now, when I say Alice is “given” the state |ψ⟩, this could mean several things: she could just be physically given a collection of n qubits. Or, she could be given a gigantic table of 2n amplitudes. Or, as a third possibility, she could be given a description of a quantum circuit that prepares |ψ⟩, say from the all-0 initial state |0n⟩. Each of these possibilities leads to a different complexity-theoretic picture, and the differences are extremely interesting to me, so that’s what I mostly focused on in my remarks in the panel discussion after Lenny’s talk. But it won’t matter much for the story I want to tell in this post.
However |ψ⟩ is given to Alice, the prediction of AdS/CFT is that |ψ⟩ encodes everything there is to know about the AdS bulk, including whatever is inside the black hole—but, and this is crucial, the information about what’s inside the black hole will be pseudorandomly scrambled. In other words, it works like this: whatever simple thing you’d like to know about parts of the bulk that aren’t hidden behind event horizons—is there a star over here? some gravitational lensing over there? etc.—it seems that you could not only learn it by measuring |ψ⟩, but learn it in polynomial time, the dictionary between bulk and boundary being computationally efficient in that case. (As with almost everything else in this subject, even that hasn’t been rigorously proven, though my postdoc Jason Pollack and I made some progress this past spring by proving a piece of it.) On the other hand, as soon as you want to know what’s inside an event horizon, the fact that there are no probes that an “observer at infinity” could apply to find out, seems to translate into the requisite measurements on |ψ⟩ being exponentially complex to apply. (Technically, you’d have to measure an ensemble of poly(n) identical copies of |ψ⟩, but I’ll ignore that in what follows.)
In more detail, the relevant part of |ψ⟩ turns into a pseudorandom, scrambled mess: a mess that it’s plausible that no polynomial-size quantum circuit could even distinguish from the maximally mixed state. So, while in principle the information is all there in |ψ⟩, getting it out seems as hard as various well-known problems in symmetric-key cryptography, if not literally NP-hard. This is way beyond what we expect even a quantum computer to be able to do efficiently: indeed, after 30 years of quantum algorithms research, the best quantum speedup we know for this sort of task is typically just the quadratic speedup from Grover’s algorithm.
So now you understand why there was some hope that Alice, by jumping into a black hole, could solve a problem that’s exponentially hard for quantum computers! Namely because, once she’s inside the black hole, she can just see the shockwaves, or the volume of the wormhole, or whatever, and no longer faces the exponentially hard task of decoding that information from |ψ⟩. It’s as if the black hole has solved the problem for her, by physically instantiating the otherwise exponentially complex transformation between the bulk and boundary descriptions of |ψ⟩.
Having now gotten your hopes up, the next step in the story is to destroy them.
Here’s the fundamental problem: |ψ⟩ does not represent the CFT dual of a bulk universe that contains the black hole with the shockwaves or whatever, and that also contains Alice herself, floating outside the black hole, and being given |ψ⟩ as an input. Indeed, it’s unclear what the latter state would even mean: how do we get around the circularity in its definition? How do we avoid an infinite regress, where |ψ⟩ would have to encode a copy of |ψ⟩ which would have to encode a copy of … and so on forever? Furthermore, who created this |ψ⟩ to give to Alice? We don’t normally imagine that an “input state” contains a complete description of the body and brain of the person whose job it is to learn the output.
By contrast, a scenario that we can define without circularity is this: Alice is given (via physical qubits, a giant table of amplitudes, an obfuscated quantum circuit, or whatever) a pure quantum state |ψ⟩, which represents the CFT dual of a hypothetical universe containing a black hole. Alice wants to learn what shockwaves or wormholes are inside the black hole, a problem plausibly conjectured not to have any ordinary polynomial-size quantum circuit that takes copies of |ψ⟩ as input. To “solve” the problem, Alice sets into motion the following sequence of events:
- Alice scans and uploads her own brain into a quantum computer, presumably destroying the original meat brain in the process! The QC represents Alice, who now exists only virtually, via a state |φ⟩.
- The QC performs entangling operations on |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩, which correspond to inserting Alice into the bulk of the universe described by |ψ⟩, and then having her fall into the black hole.
- Now in simulated form, “Alice” (or so we assume, depending on our philosophical position) has the subjective experience of falling into the black hole and observing what’s inside. Success! Given |ψ⟩ as input, we’ve now caused “Alice” (for some definition of “Alice”) to have observed the answer to the beyond-BQP computational problem.
In the panel discussion, I now model Susskind as having proposed scenario 1-3, Witten as going along with 1-2 but rejecting 3 or not wanting to discuss it, and me as having made valid points about the computational complexity of simulating Alice’s experience in 1-3, yet while being radically mistaken about what the scenario was (I still thought an actual black hole was involved).
An obvious question is whether, having learned the answer, “Alice” can now get the answer back out to the “real, original” world. Alas, the expectation is that this would require exponential time. Why? Because otherwise, this whole process would’ve constituted a subexponential-time algorithm for distinguishing random from pseudorandom states using an “ordinary” quantum computer! Which is conjectured not to exist.
And what about Alice herself? In polynomial time, could she return from “the Matrix,” back to a real-world biological body? Sure she could, in principle—if, for example, the entire quantum computation were run in reverse. But notice that reversing the computation would also make Alice forget the answer to the problem! Which is not at all a coincidence: if the problem is outside BQP, then in general, Alice can know the answer only while she’s “inside the Matrix.”
Now that hopefully everything is crystal-clear and we’re all on the same page, what can we say about this scenario? In particular: should it cause us to reject or modify the QECTT itself?
Daniel Gottesman, I thought, offered a brilliant reductio ad absurdum of the view that the simulated black hole scenario should count as a refutation of the QECTT. Well, he didn’t call it a “reductio,” but I will.
For the reductio, let’s forget not only about quantum gravity but even about quantum mechanics itself, and go all the way back to classical computer science. A fully homomorphic encryption scheme, the first example of which was discovered by Craig Gentry 15 years ago, lets you do arbitrary computations on encrypted data without ever needing to decrypt it. It has both an encryption key, for encrypting the original plaintext data, and a separate decryption key, for decrypting the final answer.
Now suppose Alice has some homomorphically encrypted top-secret emails, which she’d like to read. She has the encryption key (which is public), but not the decryption key.
If the homomorphic encryption scheme is secure against quantum computers—as the schemes discovered by Gentry and later researchers currently appear to be—and if the QECTT is true, then Alice’s goal is obviously infeasible: decrypting the data will take her exponential time.
Now, however, a classical version of Lenny comes along, and explains to Alice that she simply needs to do the following:
- Upload her own brain state into a classical computer, destroying the “meat” version in the process (who needed it?).
- Using the known encryption key, homomorphically encrypt a computer program that simulates (and thereby, we presume, enacts) Alice’s consciousness.
- Using the homomorphically encrypted Alice-brain, together with the homomorphically encrypted input data, do the homomorphic computations that simulate the process of Alice’s brain reading the top-secret emails.
The claim would now be that, inside the homomorphic encryption, the simulated Alice has the subjective experience of reading the emails in the clear. Aha, therefore she “broke” the homomorphic encryption scheme! Therefore, assuming that the scheme was secure even against quantum computers, the QECTT must be false!
According to Gottesman, this is almost perfectly analogous to Lenny’s black hole scenario. In particular, they share the property that “encryption is easy but decryption is hard.” Once she’s uploaded her brain, Alice can efficiently enter the homomorphically encrypted world to see the solution to a hard problem, just like she can efficiently enter the black hole world to do the same. In both cases, however, getting back to her normal world with the answer would then take Alice exponential time. Note that in the latter case, the difficulty is not so much about “escaping from a black hole,” as it is about inverting the AdS/CFT dictionary.
Going further, we can regard the AdS/CFT dictionary for regions behind event horizons as, itself, an example of a fully homomorphic encryption scheme—in this case, of course, one where the ciphertexts are quantum states. This strikes me as potentially an important insight about AdS/CFT itself, even if that wasn’t Gottesman’s intention. It complements many other recent connections between AdS/CFT and theoretical computer science, including the view of AdS/CFT as a quantum error-correcting code, and the connection between AdS/CFT and the Max-Flow/Min-Cut Theorem (see also my talk about my work with Jason Pollack).
So where’s the reductio? Well, when it’s put so starkly, I suspect that not many would regard Gottesman’s classical homomorphic encryption scenario as a “real” challenge to the QECTT. Or rather, people might say: yes, this raises fascinating questions for the philosophy of mind, but at any rate, we’re no longer talking about physics. Unlike with (say) quantum computing, no new physical phenomenon is being brought to light that lets an otherwise intractable computational problem be solved. Instead, it’s all about the user herself, about Alice, and which physical systems get to count as instantiating her.
It’s like, imagine Alice at the computer store, weighing which laptop to buy. Besides weight, battery life, and price, she definitely does care about processing power. She might even consider a quantum computer, if one is available. Maybe even a computer with a black hole, wormhole, or closed timelike curve inside: as long as it gives the answers she wants, what does she care about the innards? But a computer whose normal functioning would (pessimistically) kill her or (optimistically) radically change her own nature, trapping her in a simulated universe that she can escape only by forgetting the computer’s output? Yeah, I don’t envy the computer salesman.
Anyway, if we’re going to say this about the homomorphic encryption scenario, then shouldn’t we say the same about the simulated black hole scenario? Again, from an “external” perspective, all that’s happening is a giant BQP computation. Anything beyond BQP that we consider to be happening, depends on adopting the standpoint of an observer who “jumps into the homomorphic encryption on the CFT boundary”—at which point, it would seem, we’re no longer talking about physics but about philosophy of mind.
So, that was the story! I promised you that it would integrally involve black holes, holography, the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis, fully homomorphic encryption, and brain uploading, and I hope to have delivered on my promise.
Of course, while this blog post has forever cleared up all philosophical confusions about AdS/CFT and the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis, many questions of a more technical nature remain. For example: what about the original scenario? can we argue that the experiences of bulk observers can be simulated in BQP, even when those observers jump into black holes? Also, what can we say about the complexity class of problems to which the simulated Alice can learn the answers? Could she even solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time this way, or at least invert one-way functions? More broadly, what’s the power of “BQP with an oracle for applying the AdS/CFT dictionary”—once or multiple times, in one direction or both directions?
Lenny himself described his gedankenexperiment as exploring the power of a new complexity class that he called “JI/poly,” where the JI stands for “Jumping In” (to a black hole, that is). The nomenclature is transparently ridiculous—“/poly” means “with polynomial-size advice,” which we’re not talking about here—and I’ve argued in this post that the “JI” is rather misleading as well. If Alice is “jumping” anywhere, it’s not into a black hole per se, but into a quantum computer that simulates a CFT that’s dual to a bulk universe containing a black hole.
In a broader sense, though, to contemplate these questions at all is clearly to “jump in” to … something. It’s old hat by now that one can start in physics and end up in philosophy: what else is the quantum measurement problem, or the Boltzmann brain problem, or anthropic cosmological puzzles like whether (all else equal) we’re a hundred times as likely to find ourselves in a universe with a hundred times as many observers? More recently, it’s also become commonplace that one can start in physics and end in computational complexity theory: quantum computing itself is the example par excellence, but over the past decade, the Harlow-Hayden argument about decoding Hawking radiation and the complexity = action proposal have made clear that it can happen even in quantum gravity.
Lenny’s new gedankenexperiment, however, is the first case I’ve seen where you start out in physics, and end up embroiled in some of the hardest questions of philosophy of mind and computational complexity theory simultaneously.",22979,"['1a95c7660a374f7cef559ac41a6cc1fc6de99e6d7241e1621c6535a98696f24b', '51d5748008ebf50b2536da6b0cf8b22c18fe7e66617a8db0aedd2bfb8c79e0bf', '23286542d1ff62acb41af5f356ac4ae3901a4ce144786295b2233aea3b913220', 'd1962cf7b7ce6dfabacc5016e197f3508db48a6411fe75b9c9fe5b24b752803c', '58105e719151c930d73eb88e71ce2ab73ac7f7c393698c5b6c69a84a85f46e0c', '44fa6ef0f29b99cca1afbf0deb553aeaa8d1eb9f4951b5d21ad194583228b746', 'b43f48d78dfe2439dd30026e5fae65d30f49a5173a711c60a4fb2a45fd9a98d9', '3aa75723502d203c9b5ac6a395d0f6c89f2c39e13e59b26291225e739cf8f566', 'cbb44a681f294e81accc09c4de96891b0e4b36cc87b477ccc56d3e1cb7510eed', '898e4ca6d0b8f9cb0898cb7256ac4d1daba10b43abc7ab4ed4d689f00d6b4cbc', '6ad0206ee7e0e7395191bab827efba209e4280e5e8befa5a921330e870cfed82', 'bb76958a6b66604d535f04c738d95658d25ffc33899db5b36ab821b3db8b4f16', '27d9a948795d2d9554bba4b839868f842e523afa970c4df93017d7c0a441c8c0', '4cabe087e603a79191f15f5bcaddb4aeb87f9aa982a5ce3e88058a36ccf0ab47', '42c9e7ceb25c089f76da8ee8988985649cc7027746edfc5582053633f9d85abb', 'c098c56ad8798592f5ca5554cd64c15d0f4d07e6c4e3d0e45a36b34b8a392642', 'd4416ac3d63ce537af7060a71b41edf5c23842728b9660eef5751b84f1a99db4', 'bcfb69bf83e2bb56d7daddd6e917d0fc3f178adecb2f658e4eeebbf6704c25dd', 'b6ee5a5e16c726cf4861a829f0bfeb423a6aedeb22fd878328a2df99111a8be1', 'a69d98abe0ecd7f9e9b9e5a44e5d71fa08e0ad70da122e30ee9efd9ddbab678d', 'cc8535b75407d93d6423f592e99be637d3372cd96bfcb313e3ba5aae2a94d5d7', '0bbc7b1737443715b724e9dd7254b75b3894f79b4112a943c76569bbccee9097', 'ef96ca82f0ffc97291a76aa49b93b5b1f53cb6422bb4a6ea670dd436650cb83c', '749d83c2769be91407ae49db3204a0799e44fcaf9f4e2815e93ec5d9b1b12d0b', 'cc6dba5e994d4db861ab97040aa2d4672d977ea8affa59ac3d6f430c2dc3b919', 'd04c1d68f34ff6f95fc9db90f62aebceb5b6effe45ee479b23a6e58b333d563e', 'b83ea7341577d4e7356066fdc62580a34c86b206e4dd17f532ea64f67cff16ce', 'c806cabd870342171726b09098b9c2eacac4ab4e5acdc161b1d71e6d6beace61', 'da776376005d3dd6fdf7f69fedd9b836b387c22f894da0b3a49c623a9318f772', '977d06adc14f6972e06ddf16dd69d49b21a609de8fedaf4cea8d4169fad7dcee', 'eaa094031d74a0291ca09f16b89f4a51f022bfebda2bf09010454cafd44e3875', '194d4945f35cdad0e1a5178357b050f3e03194ee8ba97ed311f58a6af2c30cc7', '8f204b78b437b4b54d1c934f49265b17e77aab610bbe07d6dbf93d21b6e9837f', 'b168e1ebbac8f32648732000b04f48c0c13d9c5bf58fd6e7d5ed9ae040c470e5', '5e32743a8435210e96bc68741141dce0e426fe359ef49683ba7816ea9e93ce35', 'b23c92ac82905ea97d4322b6ccb609ea0a22f723477e7670442a1554539a1800', '7e093e52c696bd96be7f0d2dee9c1d45657f9a726421652779e08a3fdc8e9a32', '82da10bb5c0d59d4ce7cc90754e50a439519a5616eb0a7d06dd2aa4fceb0872f', '98405e3c0b1aab4f4bab98924d3825278a438bcbe28967dbd8d3f0a4cdc905da', 'e01c808f80b31deb230f6bd621eb1fc774c05cfd4c48d83a82aee85e87d9d70d', 'c4b143cd59ad24f30e1c963711d4b9dfe569f30ca2b80b86215c5d3c04bb204b', '1ff1d870738c69978cce1b745c2bfeccc035e0cc42ed45e4e55827bc5980689c', '070d7cc390319a0c7002141d282d037b0027145f57f4850f013945e0dec9730d', 'fe19d82f741a28a82ee8bf66cd8681e0b5927fec8b042592f84a3f0ef1a5d3b7', 'b6a48114d472d209fb2eb91cc2862a8b3bad38d7180d7f88a705ffbf2829f2a4', '10d88c8f1e55bdd5e96f182c02bcd20b78766f0367184828c1d9ae90bc0e6cc7', '23e7d0cc7f66294600f840288a744bce17bd7a1d463dea4fa779d4b213ea88a6', '6e045a6e47d07a62e18c95537b1683fe0e88fef4c4c7f6a60aa1e752073ed24b', 'e8438f52cf714f725da129c02fd14057c83533105a25d704232de3d6d1e89467', '103b387eb0008886626a910e91b4b3462db0a081e11422cc4c09d8e28554cd7d', 'dd5104660c4f1ba808f844b3c8e1935cb4aa61f6f6b6ab3d2fe5f2fe8f2d1009', '47377d877c6d5cbf28452cb5663d431a5a155f9f307c7f46205f707f9b61ef24', 'daac8025cf9d6f3a24022f5b6461d05e2acb726770a6512c67dceddeb9abd3dd', '7595480db84aefc1e7a260887b9911f75d7b58f34092f2d7696c133459c95ec3', '3ec74ab5d741874b4dace6b7dd3423929dafda6b76cfdbee08bf91560881e5da', '17749f60c62d99a36c41d92a48d4faf9f2c3c3d019e5117e9ca64a2a5217578e', 'bdaf44c394c342859931f4723423393d4dbe7bd22c1be562e986861b82248efc', '010332406ad35aa573fc89305bf837afc649fa030c29201672a4931766fe5764', '9a6ce307cf53cc20de8ca262c7928cb390bccee6190de664703f2a6ec2121d5e', 'c4d9b721b5999308a4fd8b7bbbac3846e6d80ea3dc632dcacd6ece84cdc60e4b', '5c8705e0f0010d0215139ee28569eace833b298ee0021c55e7b9ee8e57ef6844', '4d723be5b8577052457e0081b436a9933042c327f556a7bd158cee8653d51571', '25dc43d0273bb3d80c7ec191ba5cb75e1528ce3fe49e305feb9ab40f07aae898', '2baba84b404892e9d001efcb4964801210e3ad8d7165c64819d5cad60cd2bac7', '3506091d15ef0f499ef87f3e5acba5f90eff4b4e180137d63d0addba9a231032', '5bfdb17a606b69e7b0a3391c85543b407448ec718f03f9e5ad65e526dec78433', '2fb95f677fbf276883cfe3f8ab48b7688c99b2c5de617b9914b85e4788b0c0e3', '37b8345b7f4b28a2118422bb9446190556d696c12a2f4fbfdaa7f247a77bb77c', '72a973f3434944d1f2a0ccf786db4a8ac5496d0bc88805a76c58cfffd9748e11', 'a1a467cc013a81d85f51bb33fe450751aef702b0af5114245447f41c048e9b7a']"
10,6957,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6957,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2023-01-05,Scott Aaronson,Cargo Cult Quantum Factoring,"Just days after we celebrated my wife’s 40th birthday, she came down with COVID, meaning she’s been isolating and I’ve been spending almost all my time dealing with our kids.
But if experience has taught me anything, it’s that the quantum hype train never slows down. In the past 24 hours, at least four people have emailed to ask me about a new paper entitled “Factoring integers with sublinear resources on a superconducting quantum processor.” Even the security expert Bruce Schneier, while skeptical, took the paper surprisingly seriously.
The paper claims … well, it’s hard to pin down what it claims, but it’s certainly given many people the impression that there’s been a decisive advance on how to factor huge integers, and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem, using a near-term quantum computer. Not by using Shor’s Algorithm, mind you, but by using the deceptively similarly named Schnorr’s Algorithm. The latter is a classical algorithm based on lattices, which the authors then “enhance” using the heuristic quantum optimization method called QAOA.
For those who don’t care to read further, here is my 3-word review:
No. Just No.
And here’s my slightly longer review:
Schnorr ≠ Shor. Yes, even when Schnorr’s algorithm is dubiously “enhanced” using QAOA—a quantum algorithm that, incredibly, for all the hundreds of papers written about it, has not yet been convincingly argued to yield any speedup for any problem whatsoever (besides, as it were, the problem of reproducing its own pattern of errors) (one possible recent exception from Sami Boulebnane and Ashley Montanaro).
In the new paper, the authors spend page after page saying-without-saying that it might soon become possible to break RSA-2048, using a NISQ (i.e., non-fault-tolerant) quantum computer. They do so via two time-tested strategems:
- the detailed exploration of irrelevancies (mostly, optimization of the number of qubits, while ignoring the number of gates), and
- complete silence about the one crucial point.
Then, finally, they come clean about the one crucial point in a single sentence of the Conclusion section:
It should be pointed out that the quantum speedup of the algorithm is unclear due to the ambiguous convergence of QAOA.
“Unclear” is an understatement here. It seems to me that a miracle would be required for the approach here to yield any benefit at all, compared to just running the classical Schnorr’s algorithm on your laptop. And if the latter were able to break RSA, it would’ve already done so.
All told, this is one of the most actively misleading quantum computing papers I’ve seen in 25 years, and I’ve seen … many. Having said that, this actually isn’t the first time I’ve encountered the strange idea that the exponential quantum speedup for factoring integers, which we know about from Shor’s algorithm, should somehow “rub off” onto quantum optimization heuristics that embody none of the actual insights of Shor’s algorithm, as if by sympathetic magic.

I’m learning a huge amount from the talks and discussions here—and also simply enjoying being back in Princeton, to see old friends and visit old haunts like the Bent Spoon. Tomorrow I’ll speak about my recent work with Jason Pollack on polynomial-time AdS bulk reconstruction. [New: click here for video of my talk!]
But there’s one thing, relevant to this post, that I can’t let pass without comment. Tonight, David Nirenberg, Director of the IAS and a medieval historian, gave an after-dinner speech to our workshop, centered around how auspicious it was that the workshop was being held a mere week after the momentous announcement of a holographic wormhole on a microchip (!!)—a feat that experts were calling the first-ever laboratory investigation of quantum gravity, and a new frontier for experimental physics itself. Nirenberg asked whether, a century from now, people might look back on the wormhole achievement as today we look back on Eddington’s 1919 eclipse observations providing the evidence for general relativity.
I confess: this was the first time I felt visceral anger, rather than mere bemusement, over this wormhole affair. Before, I had implicitly assumed: no one was actually hoodwinked by this. No one really, literally believed that this little 9-qubit simulation opened up a wormhole, or helped prove the holographic nature of the real universe, or anything like that. I was wrong.
To be clear, I don’t blame Professor Nirenberg at all. If I were a medieval historian, everything he said about the experiment’s historic significance might strike me as perfectly valid inferences from what I’d read in the press. I don’t blame the It from Qubit community—most of which, I can report, was grinding its teeth and turning red in the face right alongside me. I don’t even blame most of the authors of the wormhole paper, such as Daniel Jafferis, who gave a perfectly sober, reasonable, technical talk at the workshop about how he and others managed to compress a simulation of a variant of the SYK model into a mere 9 qubits—a talk that eschewed all claims of historic significance and of literal wormhole creation.
But it’s now clear to me that, between
(1) the It from Qubit community that likes to explore speculative ideas like holographic wormholes, and
(2) the lay news readers who are now under the impression that Google just did one of the greatest physics experiments of all time,
something went terribly wrong—something that risks damaging trust in the scientific process itself. And I think it’s worth reflecting on what we can do to prevent it from happening again.
This is going to be one of the many Shtetl-Optimized posts that I didn’t feel like writing, but was given no choice but to write.
News, social media, and my inbox have been abuzz with two claims about Google’s Sycamore quantum processor, the one that now has 72 superconducting qubits.
The first claim is that Sycamore created a wormhole (!)—a historic feat possible only with a quantum computer. See for example the New York Times and Quanta and Ars Technica and Nature (and of course, the actual paper), as well as Peter Woit’s blog and Chad Orzel’s blog.
The second claim is that Sycamore’s pretensions to quantum supremacy have been refuted. The latter claim is based on this recent preprint by Dorit Aharonov, Xun Gao, Zeph Landau, Yunchao Liu, and Umesh Vazirani. No one—least of all me!—doubts that these authors have proved a strong new technical result, solving a significant open problem in the theory of noisy random circuit sampling. On the other hand, it might be less obvious how to interpret their result and put it in context. See also a YouTube video of Yunchao speaking about the new result at this week’s Simons Institute Quantum Colloquium, and of a panel discussion afterwards, where Yunchao, Umesh Vazirani, Adam Bouland, Sergio Boixo, and your humble blogger discuss what it means.
On their face, the two claims about Sycamore might seem to be in tension. After all, if Sycamore can’t do anything beyond what a classical computer can do, then how exactly did it bend the topology of spacetime?
I submit that neither claim is true. On the one hand, Sycamore did not “create a wormhole.” On the other hand, it remains pretty hard to simulate with a classical computer, as far as anyone knows. To summarize, then, our knowledge of what Sycamore can and can’t do remains much the same as last week or last month!
Let’s start with the wormhole thing. I can’t really improve over how I put it in Dennis Overbye’s NYT piece:
“The most important thing I’d want New York Times readers to understand is this,” Scott Aaronson, a quantum computing expert at the University of Texas in Austin, wrote in an email. “If this experiment has brought a wormhole into actual physical existence, then a strong case could be made that you, too, bring a wormhole into actual physical existence every time you sketch one with pen and paper.”
More broadly, Overbye’s NYT piece explains with admirable clarity what this experiment did and didn’t do—leaving only the question “wait … if that’s all that’s going on here, then why is it being written up in the NYT??” This is a rare case where, in my opinion, the NYT did a much better job than Quanta, which unequivocally accepted and amplified the “QC creates a wormhole” framing.
Alright, but what’s the actual basis for the “QC creates a wormhole” claim, for those who don’t want to leave this blog to read about it? Well, the authors used 9 of Sycamore’s 72 qubits to do a crude simulation of something called the SYK (Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev) model. SYK has become popular as a toy model for quantum gravity. In particular, it has a holographic dual description, which can indeed involve a spacetime with one or more wormholes. So, they ran a quantum circuit that crudely modelled the SYK dual of a scenario with information sent through a wormhole. They then confirmed that the circuit did what it was supposed to do—i.e., what they’d already classically calculated that it would do.
So, the objection is obvious: if someone simulates a black hole on their classical computer, they don’t say they thereby “created a black hole.” Or if they do, journalists don’t uncritically repeat the claim. Why should the standards be different just because we’re talking about a quantum computer rather than a classical one?
Did we at least learn anything new about SYK wormholes from the simulation? Alas, not really, because 9 qubits take a mere 29=512 complex numbers to specify their wavefunction, and are therefore trivial to simulate on a laptop. There’s some argument in the paper that, if the simulation were scaled up to (say) 100 qubits, then maybe we would learn something new about SYK. Even then, however, we’d mostly learn about certain corrections that arise because the simulation was being done with “only” n=100 qubits, rather than in the n→∞ limit where SYK is rigorously understood. But while those corrections, arising when n is “neither too large nor too small,” would surely be interesting to specialists, they’d have no obvious bearing on the prospects for creating real physical wormholes in our universe.
And yet, this is not a sensationalistic misunderstanding invented by journalists. Some prominent quantum gravity theorists themselves—including some of my close friends and collaborators—persist in talking about the simulated SYK wormhole as “actually being” a wormhole. What are they thinking?
Daniel Harlow explained the thinking to me as follows (he stresses that he’s explaining it, not necessarily endorsing it). If you had two entangled quantum computers, one on Earth and the other in the Andromeda galaxy, and if they were both simulating SYK, and if Alice on Earth and Bob in Andromeda both uploaded their own brains into their respective quantum simulations, then it seems possible that the simulated Alice and Bob could have the experience of jumping into a wormhole and meeting each other in the middle. Granted, they couldn’t get a message back out from the wormhole, at least not without “going the long way,” which could happen only at the speed of light—so only simulated-Alice and simulated-Bob themselves could ever test this prediction. Nevertheless, if true, I suppose some would treat it as grounds for regarding a quantum simulation of SYK as “more real” or “more wormholey” than a classical simulation.
Of course, this scenario depends on strong assumptions not merely about quantum gravity, but also about the metaphysics of consciousness! And I’d still prefer to call it a simulated wormhole for simulated people.
For completeness, here’s Harlow’s passage from the NYT article:
Daniel Harlow, a physicist at M.I.T. who was not involved in the experiment, noted that the experiment was based on a model of quantum gravity that was so simple, and unrealistic, that it could just as well have been studied using a pencil and paper.
“So I’d say that this doesn’t teach us anything about quantum gravity that we didn’t already know,” Dr. Harlow wrote in an email. “On the other hand, I think it is exciting as a technical achievement, because if we can’t even do this (and until now we couldn’t), then simulating more interesting quantum gravity theories would CERTAINLY be off the table.” Developing computers big enough to do so might take 10 or 15 years, he added.
Alright, let’s move on to the claim that quantum supremacy has been refuted. What Aharonov et al. actually show in their new work, building on earlier work by Gao and Duan, is that Random Circuit Sampling, with a constant rate of noise per gate and no error-correction, can’t provide a scalable approach to quantum supremacy. Or more precisely: as the number of qubits n goes to infinity, and assuming you’re in the “anti-concentration regime” (which in practice probably means: the depth of your quantum circuit is at least ~log(n)), there’s a classical algorithm to approximately sample the quantum circuit’s output distribution in poly(n) time (albeit, not yet a practical algorithm).
Here’s what’s crucial to understand: this is 100% consistent with what those of us working on quantum supremacy had assumed since at least 2016! We knew that if you tried to scale Random Circuit Sampling to 200 or 500 or 1000 qubits, while you also increased the circuit depth proportionately, the signal-to-noise ratio would become exponentially small, meaning that your quantum speedup would disappear. That’s why, from the very beginning, we targeted the “practical” regime of 50-100 qubits: a regime where
- you can still see explicitly that you’re exploiting a 250– or 2100-dimensional Hilbert space for computational advantage, thereby confirming one of the main predictions of quantum computing theory, but
- you also have a signal that (as it turned out) is large enough to see with heroic effort.
To their credit, Aharonov et al. explain all this perfectly clearly in their abstract and introduction. I’m just worried that others aren’t reading their paper as carefully as they should be!
So then, what’s the new advance in the Aharonov et al. paper? Well, there had been some hope that circuit depth ~log(n) might be a sweet spot, where an exponential quantum speedup might both exist and survive constant noise, even in the asymptotic limit of n→∞ qubits. Nothing in Google’s or USTC’s actual Random Circuit Sampling experiments depended on that hope, but it would’ve been nice if it were true. What Aharonov et al. have now done is to kill that hope, using powerful techniques involving summing over Feynman paths in the Pauli basis.
Stepping back, what is the current status of quantum supremacy based on Random Circuit Sampling? I would say it’s still standing, but more precariously than I’d like—underscoring the need for new and better quantum supremacy experiments. In more detail, Pan, Chen, and Zhang have shown how to simulate Google’s 53-qubit Sycamore chip classically, using what I estimated to be 100-1000X the electricity cost of running the quantum computer itself (including the dilution refrigerator!). Approaching from the problem from a different angle, Gao et al. have given a polynomial-time classical algorithm for spoofing Google’s Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (LXEB)—but their algorithm can currently achieve only about 10% of the excess in LXEB that Google’s experiment found.
So, though it’s been under sustained attack from multiple directions these past few years, I’d say that the flag of quantum supremacy yet waves. The Extended Church-Turing Thesis is still on thin ice. The wormhole is still open. Wait … no … that’s not what I meant to write…

12,6830,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6830,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2022-11-23,Scott Aaronson,Dismantling Quantum Hype with Tim Nguyen,"Happy Thanksgiving to my American readers! While I enjoy a family holiday-week vacation in exotic Dallas—and yes, I will follow up on my old JFK post by visiting Dealey Plaza—please enjoy the following Thanksgiving victuals:
I recently recorded a 3-hour (!) YouTube video with Timothy Nguyen, host of the Cartesian Cafe. Our episode is entitled Quantum Computing: Dismantling the Hype. In it, I teach a sort of extremely compressed version of my undergraduate Intro to Quantum Information Science course, unburdening myself about whatever Tim prompts me to explain: the basic rules of quantum information, quantum circuits, the quantum black-box model, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, BQP and its relationship to classical complexity classes, and sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments. This is a lot more technical than an average podcast, a lot less technical than an actual course, and hopefully just right for some nonempty subset of readers.
Outside of his podcasting career, some of you might recognize Nguyen as the coauthor, with Theo Polya, of a rebuttal of “Geometric Unity.” This latter is the proposal by the financier, podcaster, and leading “Intellectual Dark Web” figure Eric Weinstein for a unified theory of particle physics. Now, I slightly know Weinstein, and have even found him fascinating, eloquent, and correct about various issues. So, in an addendum to the main video, Nguyen chats with me about his experience critiquing Weinstein’s theory, and also about something where my knowledge is far greater: namely, my 2002 rebuttal of some of the central claims in Stephen Wolfram’s A New Kind of Science, and whether there are any updates to that story twenty years later.

13,6784,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6784,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2022-10-31,Scott Aaronson,"Oh right, quantum computing","These days, I often need to remind myself that, as an undergrad, grad student, postdoc, or professor, I’ve now been doing quantum computing research for a quarter-century—i.e., well over half of the subject’s existence. As a direct result, when I feel completely jaded about a new development in QC, it might actually be exciting. When I feel moderately excited, it might actually be the most exciting thing for years.
With that in mind:
(1) Last week National Public Radio’s Marketplace interviewed me, John Martinis, and others about the current state of quantum computing. While the piece wasn’t entirely hype-free, I’m pleased to report that my own views were represented accurately! To wit:
“There is a tsunami of hype about what quantum computers are going to revolutionize,” said Scott Aaronson, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin. “Quantum computing has turned into a word that venture capitalists or people seeking government funding will sprinkle on anything because it sounds good.”
Aaronson warned we can’t be certain that these computers will in fact revolutionize machine learning and finance and optimization problems. “We can’t prove that there’s not a quantum algorithm that solves all these problems super fast, but we can’t even prove there’s not an algorithm for a conventional computer that does it,” he said. [In the recorded version, they replaced this by a simpler but also accurate thought: namely, that we can’t prove one way or the other whether there’s a useful quantum advantage for these tasks.]
(2) I don’t like to use this blog to toot my own research horn, but on Thursday my postdoc Jason Pollack and I released a paper, entitled Discrete Bulk Reconstruction. And to be honest, I’m pretty damned excited about it. It represents about 8 months of Jason—a cosmologist and string theorist who studied under Sean Carroll—helping me understand AdS/CFT in the language of the undergraduate CS curriculum, like min-cuts on undirected graphs, so that we could then look for polynomial-time algorithms to implement the holographic mapping from boundary quantum states to the spatial geometry in the bulk. We drew heavily on previous work in the same direction, especially the already-seminal 2015 holographic entropy cone paper by Ning Bao et al. But I’d like to think that, among other things, our work represents a new frontier in just how accessible AdS/CFT itself can be made to CS and discrete math types. Anyway, here’s the abstract if you’re interested:
According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the geometries of certain spacetimes are fully determined by quantum states that live on their boundaries — indeed, by the von Neumann entropies of portions of those boundary states. This work investigates to what extent the geometries can be reconstructed from the entropies in polynomial time. Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani (2019) argued that the AdS/CFT map can be exponentially complex if one wants to reconstruct regions such as the interiors of black holes. Our main result provides a sort of converse: we show that, in the special case of a single 1D boundary, if the input data consists of a list of entropies of contiguous boundary regions, and if the entropies satisfy a single inequality called Strong Subadditivity, then we can construct a graph model for the bulk in linear time. Moreover, the bulk graph is planar, it has O(N2) vertices (the information-theoretic minimum), and it’s “universal,” with only the edge weights depending on the specific entropies in question. From a combinatorial perspective, our problem boils down to an “inverse” of the famous min-cut problem: rather than being given a graph and asked to find a min-cut, here we’re given the values of min-cuts separating various sets of vertices, and need to find a weighted undirected graph consistent with those values. Our solution to this problem relies on the notion of a “bulkless” graph, which might be of independent interest for AdS/CFT. We also make initial progress on the case of multiple 1D boundaries — where the boundaries could be connected via wormholes — including an upper bound of O(N4) vertices whenever a planar bulk graph exists (thus putting the problem into the complexity class NP).
(3) Anand Natarajan and Chinmay Nirkhe posted a preprint entitled A classical oracle separation between QMA and QCMA, which makes progress on a problem that’s been raised on this blog all the way back to its inception. A bit of context: QMA, Quantum Merlin-Arthur, captures what can be proven using a quantum state with poly(n) qubits as the proof, and a polynomial-time quantum algorithm as the verifier. QCMA, or Quantum Classical Merlin-Arthur, is the same as QMA except that now the proof has to be classical. A fundamental problem of quantum complexity theory, first raised by Aharonov and Naveh in 2002, is whether QMA=QCMA. In 2007, Greg Kuperberg and I introduced the concept of quantum oracle separation—that is, a unitary that can be applied in a black-box manner—in order to show that there’s a quantum oracle relative to which QCMA≠QMA. In 2015, Fefferman and Kimmel improved this, to show that there’s a “randomized in-place” oracle relative to which QCMA≠QMA. Natarajan and Nirkhe now remove the “in-place” part, meaning the only thing still “wrong” with their oracle is that it’s randomized. Derandomizing their construction would finally settle this 20-year-old open problem (except, of course, for the minor detail of whether QMA=QCMA in the “real,” unrelativized world!).

I don’t personally know Aspect or Clauser, but Zeilinger extremely graciously hosted me and my wife Dana when we visited Vienna in 2012, even bringing us to the symphony (he knows the director and has front-row seats), and somehow making me feel more cultured rather than less.
As usual, the recipe for winning the Nobel Prize in Physics is this:
(1) Do something where anyone who knows about it is like, “why haven’t they given the Nobel Prize in Physics for that yet?”
(2) Live long enough.
Huge congratulations to Aspect, Clauser, and Zeilinger!
Elham Kashefi, my quantum complexity theory colleague and treasured friend for more than 20 years, brought to my attention a Statement of Solidarity with Students in Iran from the International Academic Community.

I urge you to sign the statement as well. If enough Shtetl-Optimized readers disapprove of their brutal repression, surely the mullahs will reconsider!

They cover material that I taught, for the first time, in my Introduction to Quantum Information Science II undergrad course at UT Austin in Spring 2022.
The new notes pick up exactly where my older QIS I lecture notes left off, and they presuppose familiarity with the QIS I material. So, if you’re just beginning your quantum information journey, then please start with my QIS I notes, which presuppose only linear algebra and a bit of classical algorithms (e.g., recurrence relations and big-O notation), and which self-containedly explain all the rules of QM, moving on to (e.g.) quantum circuits, density matrices, entanglement entropy, Wiesner’s quantum money, QKD, quantum teleportation, the Bell inequality, interpretations of QM, the Shor 9-qubit code, and the algorithms of Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon, Shor, and Grover. Master all that, and you’ll be close to the quantum information research frontier of circa 1996.
My new QIS II notes cover a bunch of topics, but the main theme is “perspectives on quantum computing that go beyond the bare quantum circuit model, and that became increasingly central to the field from the late 1990s onwards.” Thus, it covers:
- Hamiltonians, ground states, the adiabatic algorithm, and the universality of adiabatic QC
- The stabilizer formalism, the 1996 Gottesman-Knill Theorem on efficient classical simulation of stabilizer QC, my and Gottesman’s 2004 elaborations, boosting up to universality via “magic states,” transversal codes, and the influential 2016 concept of stabilizer rank
- Bosons and fermions: the formalism of Fock space and of creation and annihilation operators, connection to the permanents and determinants of matrices, efficient classical simulation of free fermionic systems (Valiant’s 2002 “matchcircuits”), the 2001 Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) theorem on universal optical QC, BosonSampling and its computational complexity, and the current experimental status of BosonSampling
- Cluster states, Raussendorf and Briegel’s 2000 measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), and Gottesman and Chuang’s 1999 “gate teleportation” trick
- Matrix product states, and Vidal’s 2003 efficient classical simulation of “slightly entangled” quantum computations
Extra bonus topics include:
- The 2007 Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi (BFK) protocol for blind and authenticated QC; brief discussion of later developments including Reichardt-Unger-Vazirani 2012 and Mahadev 2018
- Basic protocols for quantum state tomography
- My 2007 work on PAC-learnability of quantum states
- The “dessert course”: the black hole information problem, and the Harlow-Hayden argument on the computational hardness of decoding Hawking radiation
Master all this, and hopefully you’ll have the conceptual vocabulary to understand a large fraction of what people in quantum computing and information care about today, how they now think about building scalable QCs, and what they post to the quant-ph arXiv.
Note that my QIS II course is complementary to my graduate course on quantum complexity theory, for which the lecture notes are here. There’s very little overlap between the two (and even less overlap between QIS II and Quantum Computing Since Democritus).
The biggest, most important topic related to the QIS II theme that I didn’t cover was topological quantum computing. I’d wanted to, but it quickly became clear that topological QC begs for a whole course of its own, and that I had neither the time nor the expertise to do it justice. In retrospect, I do wish I’d at least covered the Kitaev surface code.
Crucially, these lecture notes don’t represent my effort alone. I worked from draft scribe notes prepared by the QIS II students, who did a far better job than I had any right to expect (including creating the beautiful figures). My wonderful course TA and PhD student Daniel Liang, along with students Ethan Tan, Samuel Ziegelbein, and Steven Han, then assembled everything, fixed numerous errors, and compiled the bibliography. I’m grateful to all of them. At the last minute, we had a LaTeX issue that none of us knew how to fix—but, in response to a plea, Shtetl-Optimized reader Pablo Cingolani generously volunteered to help, completed the work by the very next day (I’d imagined it taking a month!), and earned a fruit basket from me in gratitude.
Anyway, let me know of any mistakes you find!

Thanks for the kind words about my blog, and for your piece, which I just read. There’s a great deal of truth in what you write, but I also take issue with a few points. You say:
A convincing strategy for overcoming these errors has not yet been demonstrated, making it unclear as to when — if ever — it will become possible to build a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer.
In one sense this is tautologically true — the only fully convincing and clear demonstration that something is possible is to do it, as with the Wright brothers or the Trinity nuclear test. In other sense, though, we’ve known the “strategy” since the 1990s. It’s just that the fault-tolerance theorem called for gate fidelities 5-6 orders of magnitude better than anything achievable at the time. In the 25 years since, about 3 of those orders of magnitude have been achieved, so it doesn’t take any great imagination to foresee that the remainder could be as well. A layperson reading your piece might not understand this.
As for applications, my position has always been that if there were zero applications, it would still be at least as scientifically important to try to build QCs as it was to build the LHC, LIGO, or the James Webb telescope. If there are real applications, such as simulating chemical dynamics, or certifiable randomness — and there very well might be — then those are icing on the cake. This, of course, radically differs from the vision that now gets presented to investors and the press (hence all the railing on my blog!), but it also differs from what a reader of your piece would take away.
Anyway, thanks again for sharing!
Best,

The notes will be freely shared on this blog. But the bibliographies for the various lectures need to be merged, and we don’t know how. Would any TeXpert like to help us, in exchange for a generous acknowledgment? A reader named Pablo Cingolani has now graciously taken care of this. Thanks so much, Pablo!
I returned last week from the NSF Workshop on Quantum Advantage and Next Steps at the University of Chicago. Thanks so much to Chicago CS professor (and my former summer student) Bill Fefferman and the other organizers for making this workshop a reality. Given how vividly I remember the situation 12 years ago, when the idea of sampling-based quantum supremacy was the weird obsession of me and a few others, it was particularly special to attend a workshop on the topic with well over a hundred participants, some in-person and some on Zoom, delayed by covid but still excited by the dramatic experimental progress of the past few years.
Of course there’s a lot still to do. Many of the talks drew an exclamation point on something I’ve been saying for the past couple years: that there’s an urgent need for better quantum supremacy experiments, which will require both theoretical and engineering advances. The experiments by Google and USTC and now Xanadu represent a big step forward for the field, but since they started being done, the classical spoofing attacks have also steadily improved, to the point that whether “quantum computational supremacy” still exists depends on exactly how you define it.
Briefly: if you measure by total operations, energy use, or CO2 footprint, then probably yes, quantum supremacy remains. But if you measure by number of seconds, then it doesn’t remain, not if you’re willing to shell out for enough cores on AWS or your favorite supercomputer. And even the quantum supremacy that does remain might eventually fall to, e.g., further improvements of the algorithm due to Gao et al. For more details, see, e.g., the now-published work of Pan, Chen, and Zhang, or this good popular summary by Adrian Cho for Science.
If the experimentalists care enough, they could easily regain the quantum lead, at least for a couple more years, by (say) repeating random circuit sampling with 72 qubits rather than 53-60, and hopefully circuit depth of 30-40 rather than just 20-25. But the point I made in my talk was that, as long as we remain in the paradigm of sampling experiments that take ~2n time to verify classically and also ~2n time to spoof classically (where n is the number of qubits), all quantum speedups that we can achieve will be fragile and contingent, however interesting and impressive. As soon as we go way beyond what classical computers can keep up with, we’ve also gone way beyond where classical computers can check what was done.
I argued that the only solution to this problem is to design new quantum supremacy experiments: ones where some secret has been inserted in the quantum circuit that lets a classical computer efficiently verify the results. The fundamental problem is that we need three properties—
- implementability on near-term quantum computers,
- efficient classical verifiability, and
- confidence that quantum computers have a theoretical asymptotic advantage,
and right now we only know how to get any two out of the three. We can get 1 and 2 with QAOA and various other heuristic quantum algorithms, 1 and 3 with BosonSampling and Random Circuit Sampling, or 2 and 3 with Shor’s algorithm or Yamakawa-Zhandry or recent interactive protocols. To get all three, there are three obvious approaches:
- Start with the heuristic algorithms and find a real advantage from them,
- Start with BosonSampling or Random Circuit Sampling or the like and figure out how to make them efficiently verifiable classically, or
- Start with protocols like Kahanamoku-Meyer et al.’s and figure out how to run them on near-term devices.
At the Chicago workshop, I’d say that the most popular approach speakers talked about was 3, although my own focus was more on 2.
Anyway, until a “best-of-all-worlds” quantum supremacy experiment is discovered, there’s plenty to do in the meantime: for example, better understand the classical hardness of spoofing Random Circuit Sampling with a constant or logarithmic number of gate layers. Understand the best that classical algorithms can do to spoof the Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark for BosonSampling, and build on Grier et al. to understand the power of BosonSampling with a linear number of modes.
I’ll be flying back with my family to Austin today after seven weeks at the Jersey shore, but I’ll try to field any questions about the state of quantum supremacy in general or this workshop in particular in the comments!",4882,"['8391457244493b071b1bf674e2d569cff583722b7a7f12602c11c4f4bae40dff', '605910cf93ca0c26799f1f441c4138f0c7c6d67af6652ebd45bca5db913522b6', '7b01a931784fc794e433503243935ea81920b807465e3fceda098389fcb20349', 'ada911b260ae3ceda78b5864f4a57763ad7145eb6feec3d971751ebab81bec41', 'f4f635fdabae03baf52317b3e5d339810399b89f5db83e8186d06bdfe509080d', 'f47950fb11f9bb6fe5585628fe27d989df27cb35b40d5b26e8a5dfd17d643f57', 'a5ab8f56320620f3470906b59561606dd4aa68dd4204b3f38d8641aa154ca551', '4ba7c68238255f3c3c57c6b0a11f4fc63172ea4236f0149b454f6be14a32a65d', '277b19a17e029fee5b7c53268f8605b74c1cc9592bd2667dcdc60f45ee3f6783', 'd2eb5a938257c812fb19d8308b392c95f30a6234bcb78ef7c3e9a3b8fae86492', '062f5b1746f82fff9d0eb7003a6c44bc44532c33a71e03719bbba2b21ed41e7f', '62518a380beabebc0deb81cf2b4550f98781f8368907c9075138687e33a56e52', '0261c4a7efa794990c21b3b8cf674c460936e4c3cea2b4b58edaa04ae8a2e2b9', '388d62bf6ac51f84d197c58a1040e64cc25c7d663e6aef458e9c6ce1bde7d296', 'ff92966c75d4e656d708d906026c9f6ea28a2e56afe095b0d38e8fdf6612381d', 'd7cf0cbe89539c550f68b315336439b7374ee5eee761cfe9e4fc965e2aa0e54b']"

Not much new for regular readers, but I’m very happy with how it came out—thanks so much to Robert Davis and Olivia Lanes for making it happen! My only quibble is with the sketch of my face, which might create the inaccurate impression that I no longer have teeth.
- Boaz Barak pointed me to a Twitter thread of DALL-E paintings of people using quantum computers, in the styles of many of history’s famous artists. While the motifs are unsurprising (QCs look like regular computers but glowing, or maybe like giant glowing atoms), highly recommended as another demonstration of the sort of thing DALL-E does best.
- Dan Spielman asked me to announce that the National Academy of Sciences is seeking nominations for the Held Prize in combinatorial and discrete optimization. The deadline is October 3.
- I’m at the NSF Workshop on Quantum Advantage and Next Steps at the University of Chicago. My talk yesterday was entitled “Verifiable Quantum Advantage: What I Hope Will Be Done” (yeah yeah, I decided to call it “advantage” rather than “supremacy” in deference to the name of the workshop). My PowerPoint slides are here. Meanwhile, this morning was the BosonSampling session. The talk by Chaoyang Lu, leader of USTC’s experimental BosonSampling effort, was punctuated by numerous silly memes and videos, as well as the following striking sentence: “only by putting the seven dragon balls together can you unlock the true quantum computational power.”
- Gavin Leech lists and excerpts his favorite writings of mine over the past 25 years, while complaining that I spend “a lot of time rebutting fleeting manias” and “obsess[ing] over political flotsam.”

I promise you: this post is going to tell a scientifically coherent story that involves all five topics listed in the title. Not one can be omitted.
My story starts with a Zoom talk that the one and only Lenny Susskind delivered for the Simons Institute for Theory of Computing back in May. There followed a panel discussion involving Lenny, Edward Witten, Geoffrey Penington, Umesh Vazirani, and your humble shtetlmaster.
Lenny’s talk led up to a gedankenexperiment involving an observer, Alice, who bravely jumps into a specially-prepared black hole, in order to see the answer to a certain computational problem in her final seconds before being ripped to shreds near the singularity. Drawing on earlier work by Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani, Lenny speculated that the computational problem could be exponentially hard even for a (standard) quantum computer. Despite this, Lenny repeatedly insisted—indeed, he asked me again to stress here—that he was not claiming to violate the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis (QECTT), the statement that all of nature can be efficiently simulated by a standard quantum computer. Instead, he was simply investigating how the QECTT needs to be formulated in order to be a true statement.
I didn’t understand this, to put it mildly. If what Lenny was saying was right—i.e., if the infalling observer could see the answer to a computational problem not in BQP, or Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time—then why shouldn’t we call that a violation of the QECTT? Just like we call Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm a likely violation of the classical Extended Church-Turing Thesis, the thesis saying that nature can be efficiently simulated by a classical computer? Granted, you don’t have to die in order to run Shor’s algorithm, as you do to run Lenny’s experiment. But why should such implementation details matter from the lofty heights of computational complexity?
Alas, not only did Lenny never answer that in a way that made sense to me, he kept trying to shift the focus from real, physical black holes to “silicon spheres” made of qubits, which would be programmed to simulate the process of Alice jumping into the black hole (in a dual boundary description). Say what? Granting that Lenny’s silicon spheres, being quantum computers under another name, could clearly be simulated in BQP, wouldn’t this still leave the question about the computational powers of observers who jump into actual black holes—i.e., the question that we presumably cared about in the first place?
Confusing me even further, Witten seemed almost dismissive of the idea that Lenny’s gedankenexperiment raised any new issue for the QECTT—that is, any issue that wouldn’t already have been present in a universe without gravity. But as to Witten’s reasons, the most I understood from his remarks was that he was worried about various “engineering” issues with implementing Lenny’s gedankenexperiment, involving gravitational backreaction and the like. Ed Witten, now suddenly the practical guy! I couldn’t even isolate the crux of disagreement between Susskind and Witten, since after all, they agreed (bizarrely, from my perspective) that the QECTT wasn’t violated. Why wasn’t it?
Anyway, shortly afterward I attended the 28th Solvay Conference in Brussels, where one of the central benefits I got—besides seeing friends after a long COVID absence and eating some amazing chocolate mousse—was a dramatically clearer understanding of the issues in Lenny’s gedankenexperiment. I owe this improved understanding to conversations with many people at Solvay, but above all Daniel Gottesman and Daniel Harlow. Lenny himself wasn’t there, other than in spirit, but I ran the Daniels’ picture by him afterwards and he assented to all of its essentials.
The Daniels’ picture is what I want to explain in this post. Needless to say, I take sole responsibility for any errors in my presentation, as I also take sole responsibility for not understanding (or rather: not doing the work to translate into terms that I understood) what Susskind and Witten had said to me before.
The first thing you need to understand about Lenny’s gedankenexperiment is that it takes place entirely in the context of AdS/CFT: the famous holographic duality between two types of physical theories that look wildly different. Here AdS stands for anti-de-Sitter: a quantum theory of gravity describing a D-dimensional universe with a negative cosmological constant (i.e. hyperbolic geometry), one where black holes can form and evaporate and so forth. Meanwhile, CFT stands for conformal field theory: a quantum field theory, with no apparent gravity (and hence no black holes), that lives on the (D-1)-dimensional boundary of the D-dimensional AdS space. The staggering claim of AdS/CFT is that every physical question about the AdS bulk can be translated into an equivalent question about the CFT boundary, and vice versa, with a one-to-one mapping from states to states and observables to observables. So in that sense, they’re actually the same theory, just viewed in two radically different ways. AdS/CFT originally came out of string theory, but then notoriously “swallowed its parent,” to the point where nowadays, if you go to what are still called “string theory” meetings, you’re liable to hear vastly more discussion of AdS/CFT than of actual strings.
Thankfully, the story I want to tell won’t depend on fine details of how AdS/CFT works. Nevertheless, you can’t just ignore the AdS/CFT part as some technicality, in order to get on with the vivid tale of Alice jumping into a black hole, hoping to learn the answer to a beyond-BQP computational problem in her final seconds of existence. The reason you can’t ignore it is that the whole beyond-BQP computational problem we’ll be talking about, involves the translation (or “dictionary”) between the AdS bulk and the CFT boundary. If you like, then, it’s actually the chasm between bulk and boundary that plays the starring role in this story. The more familiar chasm within the bulk, between the interior of a black hole and its exterior (the two separated by an event horizon), plays only a subsidiary role: that of causing the AdS/CFT dictionary to become exponentially complex, as far as anyone can tell.
Pause for a minute. Previously I led you to believe that we’d be talking about an actual observer Alice, jumping into an actual physical black hole, and whether Alice could see the answer to a problem that’s intractable even for quantum computers in her last moments before hitting the singularity, and if so whether we should take that to refute the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis. What I’m saying now is so wildly at variance with that picture, that it had to be repeated to me about 10 times before I understood it. Once I did understand, I then had to repeat it to others about 10 times before they understood. And I don’t care if people ridicule me for that admission—how slow Scott and his friends must be, compared to string theorists!—because my only goal right now is to get you to understand it.
To say it again: Lenny has not proposed a way for Alice to surpass the complexity-theoretic power of quantum computers, even for a brief moment, by crossing the event horizon of a black hole. If that was Alice’s goal when she jumped into the black hole, then alas, she probably sacrificed her life for nothing! As far as anyone knows, Alice’s experiences, even after crossing the event horizon, ought to continue to be described extremely well by general relativity and quantum field theory (at least until she nears the singularity and dies), and therefore ought to be simulatable in BQP. Granted, we don’t actually know this—you can call it an open problem if you like—but it seems like a reasonable guess.
In that case, though, what beyond-BQP problem was Lenny talking about, and what does it have to do with black holes? Building on the Bouland-Fefferman-Vazirani paper, Lenny was interested in a class of problems of the following form: Alice is given as input a pure quantum state |ψ⟩, which encodes a boundary CFT state, which is dual to an AdS bulk universe that contains a black hole. Alice’s goal is, by examining |ψ⟩, to learn something about what’s inside the black hole. For example: does the black hole interior contain “shockwaves,” and if so how many and what kind? Does it contain a wormhole, connecting it to a different black hole in another universe? If so, what’s the volume of that wormhole? (Not the first question I would ask either, but bear with me.)
Now, when I say Alice is “given” the state |ψ⟩, this could mean several things: she could just be physically given a collection of n qubits. Or, she could be given a gigantic table of 2n amplitudes. Or, as a third possibility, she could be given a description of a quantum circuit that prepares |ψ⟩, say from the all-0 initial state |0n⟩. Each of these possibilities leads to a different complexity-theoretic picture, and the differences are extremely interesting to me, so that’s what I mostly focused on in my remarks in the panel discussion after Lenny’s talk. But it won’t matter much for the story I want to tell in this post.
However |ψ⟩ is given to Alice, the prediction of AdS/CFT is that |ψ⟩ encodes everything there is to know about the AdS bulk, including whatever is inside the black hole—but, and this is crucial, the information about what’s inside the black hole will be pseudorandomly scrambled. In other words, it works like this: whatever simple thing you’d like to know about parts of the bulk that aren’t hidden behind event horizons—is there a star over here? some gravitational lensing over there? etc.—it seems that you could not only learn it by measuring |ψ⟩, but learn it in polynomial time, the dictionary between bulk and boundary being computationally efficient in that case. (As with almost everything else in this subject, even that hasn’t been rigorously proven, though my postdoc Jason Pollack and I made some progress this past spring by proving a piece of it.) On the other hand, as soon as you want to know what’s inside an event horizon, the fact that there are no probes that an “observer at infinity” could apply to find out, seems to translate into the requisite measurements on |ψ⟩ being exponentially complex to apply. (Technically, you’d have to measure an ensemble of poly(n) identical copies of |ψ⟩, but I’ll ignore that in what follows.)
In more detail, the relevant part of |ψ⟩ turns into a pseudorandom, scrambled mess: a mess that it’s plausible that no polynomial-size quantum circuit could even distinguish from the maximally mixed state. So, while in principle the information is all there in |ψ⟩, getting it out seems as hard as various well-known problems in symmetric-key cryptography, if not literally NP-hard. This is way beyond what we expect even a quantum computer to be able to do efficiently: indeed, after 30 years of quantum algorithms research, the best quantum speedup we know for this sort of task is typically just the quadratic speedup from Grover’s algorithm.
So now you understand why there was some hope that Alice, by jumping into a black hole, could solve a problem that’s exponentially hard for quantum computers! Namely because, once she’s inside the black hole, she can just see the shockwaves, or the volume of the wormhole, or whatever, and no longer faces the exponentially hard task of decoding that information from |ψ⟩. It’s as if the black hole has solved the problem for her, by physically instantiating the otherwise exponentially complex transformation between the bulk and boundary descriptions of |ψ⟩.
Having now gotten your hopes up, the next step in the story is to destroy them.
Here’s the fundamental problem: |ψ⟩ does not represent the CFT dual of a bulk universe that contains the black hole with the shockwaves or whatever, and that also contains Alice herself, floating outside the black hole, and being given |ψ⟩ as an input. Indeed, it’s unclear what the latter state would even mean: how do we get around the circularity in its definition? How do we avoid an infinite regress, where |ψ⟩ would have to encode a copy of |ψ⟩ which would have to encode a copy of … and so on forever? Furthermore, who created this |ψ⟩ to give to Alice? We don’t normally imagine that an “input state” contains a complete description of the body and brain of the person whose job it is to learn the output.
By contrast, a scenario that we can define without circularity is this: Alice is given (via physical qubits, a giant table of amplitudes, an obfuscated quantum circuit, or whatever) a pure quantum state |ψ⟩, which represents the CFT dual of a hypothetical universe containing a black hole. Alice wants to learn what shockwaves or wormholes are inside the black hole, a problem plausibly conjectured not to have any ordinary polynomial-size quantum circuit that takes copies of |ψ⟩ as input. To “solve” the problem, Alice sets into motion the following sequence of events:
- Alice scans and uploads her own brain into a quantum computer, presumably destroying the original meat brain in the process! The QC represents Alice, who now exists only virtually, via a state |φ⟩.
- The QC performs entangling operations on |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩, which correspond to inserting Alice into the bulk of the universe described by |ψ⟩, and then having her fall into the black hole.
- Now in simulated form, “Alice” (or so we assume, depending on our philosophical position) has the subjective experience of falling into the black hole and observing what’s inside. Success! Given |ψ⟩ as input, we’ve now caused “Alice” (for some definition of “Alice”) to have observed the answer to the beyond-BQP computational problem.
In the panel discussion, I now model Susskind as having proposed scenario 1-3, Witten as going along with 1-2 but rejecting 3 or not wanting to discuss it, and me as having made valid points about the computational complexity of simulating Alice’s experience in 1-3, yet while being radically mistaken about what the scenario was (I still thought an actual black hole was involved).
An obvious question is whether, having learned the answer, “Alice” can now get the answer back out to the “real, original” world. Alas, the expectation is that this would require exponential time. Why? Because otherwise, this whole process would’ve constituted a subexponential-time algorithm for distinguishing random from pseudorandom states using an “ordinary” quantum computer! Which is conjectured not to exist.
And what about Alice herself? In polynomial time, could she return from “the Matrix,” back to a real-world biological body? Sure she could, in principle—if, for example, the entire quantum computation were run in reverse. But notice that reversing the computation would also make Alice forget the answer to the problem! Which is not at all a coincidence: if the problem is outside BQP, then in general, Alice can know the answer only while she’s “inside the Matrix.”
Now that hopefully everything is crystal-clear and we’re all on the same page, what can we say about this scenario? In particular: should it cause us to reject or modify the QECTT itself?
Daniel Gottesman, I thought, offered a brilliant reductio ad absurdum of the view that the simulated black hole scenario should count as a refutation of the QECTT. Well, he didn’t call it a “reductio,” but I will.
For the reductio, let’s forget not only about quantum gravity but even about quantum mechanics itself, and go all the way back to classical computer science. A fully homomorphic encryption scheme, the first example of which was discovered by Craig Gentry 15 years ago, lets you do arbitrary computations on encrypted data without ever needing to decrypt it. It has both an encryption key, for encrypting the original plaintext data, and a separate decryption key, for decrypting the final answer.
Now suppose Alice has some homomorphically encrypted top-secret emails, which she’d like to read. She has the encryption key (which is public), but not the decryption key.
If the homomorphic encryption scheme is secure against quantum computers—as the schemes discovered by Gentry and later researchers currently appear to be—and if the QECTT is true, then Alice’s goal is obviously infeasible: decrypting the data will take her exponential time.
Now, however, a classical version of Lenny comes along, and explains to Alice that she simply needs to do the following:
- Upload her own brain state into a classical computer, destroying the “meat” version in the process (who needed it?).
- Using the known encryption key, homomorphically encrypt a computer program that simulates (and thereby, we presume, enacts) Alice’s consciousness.
- Using the homomorphically encrypted Alice-brain, together with the homomorphically encrypted input data, do the homomorphic computations that simulate the process of Alice’s brain reading the top-secret emails.
The claim would now be that, inside the homomorphic encryption, the simulated Alice has the subjective experience of reading the emails in the clear. Aha, therefore she “broke” the homomorphic encryption scheme! Therefore, assuming that the scheme was secure even against quantum computers, the QECTT must be false!
According to Gottesman, this is almost perfectly analogous to Lenny’s black hole scenario. In particular, they share the property that “encryption is easy but decryption is hard.” Once she’s uploaded her brain, Alice can efficiently enter the homomorphically encrypted world to see the solution to a hard problem, just like she can efficiently enter the black hole world to do the same. In both cases, however, getting back to her normal world with the answer would then take Alice exponential time. Note that in the latter case, the difficulty is not so much about “escaping from a black hole,” as it is about inverting the AdS/CFT dictionary.
Going further, we can regard the AdS/CFT dictionary for regions behind event horizons as, itself, an example of a fully homomorphic encryption scheme—in this case, of course, one where the ciphertexts are quantum states. This strikes me as potentially an important insight about AdS/CFT itself, even if that wasn’t Gottesman’s intention. It complements many other recent connections between AdS/CFT and theoretical computer science, including the view of AdS/CFT as a quantum error-correcting code, and the connection between AdS/CFT and the Max-Flow/Min-Cut Theorem (see also my talk about my work with Jason Pollack).
So where’s the reductio? Well, when it’s put so starkly, I suspect that not many would regard Gottesman’s classical homomorphic encryption scenario as a “real” challenge to the QECTT. Or rather, people might say: yes, this raises fascinating questions for the philosophy of mind, but at any rate, we’re no longer talking about physics. Unlike with (say) quantum computing, no new physical phenomenon is being brought to light that lets an otherwise intractable computational problem be solved. Instead, it’s all about the user herself, about Alice, and which physical systems get to count as instantiating her.
It’s like, imagine Alice at the computer store, weighing which laptop to buy. Besides weight, battery life, and price, she definitely does care about processing power. She might even consider a quantum computer, if one is available. Maybe even a computer with a black hole, wormhole, or closed timelike curve inside: as long as it gives the answers she wants, what does she care about the innards? But a computer whose normal functioning would (pessimistically) kill her or (optimistically) radically change her own nature, trapping her in a simulated universe that she can escape only by forgetting the computer’s output? Yeah, I don’t envy the computer salesman.
Anyway, if we’re going to say this about the homomorphic encryption scenario, then shouldn’t we say the same about the simulated black hole scenario? Again, from an “external” perspective, all that’s happening is a giant BQP computation. Anything beyond BQP that we consider to be happening, depends on adopting the standpoint of an observer who “jumps into the homomorphic encryption on the CFT boundary”—at which point, it would seem, we’re no longer talking about physics but about philosophy of mind.
So, that was the story! I promised you that it would integrally involve black holes, holography, the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis, fully homomorphic encryption, and brain uploading, and I hope to have delivered on my promise.
Of course, while this blog post has forever cleared up all philosophical confusions about AdS/CFT and the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis, many questions of a more technical nature remain. For example: what about the original scenario? can we argue that the experiences of bulk observers can be simulated in BQP, even when those observers jump into black holes? Also, what can we say about the complexity class of problems to which the simulated Alice can learn the answers? Could she even solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time this way, or at least invert one-way functions? More broadly, what’s the power of “BQP with an oracle for applying the AdS/CFT dictionary”—once or multiple times, in one direction or both directions?
Lenny himself described his gedankenexperiment as exploring the power of a new complexity class that he called “JI/poly,” where the JI stands for “Jumping In” (to a black hole, that is). The nomenclature is transparently ridiculous—“/poly” means “with polynomial-size advice,” which we’re not talking about here—and I’ve argued in this post that the “JI” is rather misleading as well. If Alice is “jumping” anywhere, it’s not into a black hole per se, but into a quantum computer that simulates a CFT that’s dual to a bulk universe containing a black hole.
In a broader sense, though, to contemplate these questions at all is clearly to “jump in” to … something. It’s old hat by now that one can start in physics and end up in philosophy: what else is the quantum measurement problem, or the Boltzmann brain problem, or anthropic cosmological puzzles like whether (all else equal) we’re a hundred times as likely to find ourselves in a universe with a hundred times as many observers? More recently, it’s also become commonplace that one can start in physics and end in computational complexity theory: quantum computing itself is the example par excellence, but over the past decade, the Harlow-Hayden argument about decoding Hawking radiation and the complexity = action proposal have made clear that it can happen even in quantum gravity.
Lenny’s new gedankenexperiment, however, is the first case I’ve seen where you start out in physics, and end up embroiled in some of the hardest questions of philosophy of mind and computational complexity theory simultaneously.",22979,"['1a95c7660a374f7cef559ac41a6cc1fc6de99e6d7241e1621c6535a98696f24b', '51d5748008ebf50b2536da6b0cf8b22c18fe7e66617a8db0aedd2bfb8c79e0bf', '23286542d1ff62acb41af5f356ac4ae3901a4ce144786295b2233aea3b913220', 'd1962cf7b7ce6dfabacc5016e197f3508db48a6411fe75b9c9fe5b24b752803c', '58105e719151c930d73eb88e71ce2ab73ac7f7c393698c5b6c69a84a85f46e0c', '44fa6ef0f29b99cca1afbf0deb553aeaa8d1eb9f4951b5d21ad194583228b746', 'b43f48d78dfe2439dd30026e5fae65d30f49a5173a711c60a4fb2a45fd9a98d9', '3aa75723502d203c9b5ac6a395d0f6c89f2c39e13e59b26291225e739cf8f566', 'cbb44a681f294e81accc09c4de96891b0e4b36cc87b477ccc56d3e1cb7510eed', '898e4ca6d0b8f9cb0898cb7256ac4d1daba10b43abc7ab4ed4d689f00d6b4cbc', '6ad0206ee7e0e7395191bab827efba209e4280e5e8befa5a921330e870cfed82', 'bb76958a6b66604d535f04c738d95658d25ffc33899db5b36ab821b3db8b4f16', '27d9a948795d2d9554bba4b839868f842e523afa970c4df93017d7c0a441c8c0', '4cabe087e603a79191f15f5bcaddb4aeb87f9aa982a5ce3e88058a36ccf0ab47', '42c9e7ceb25c089f76da8ee8988985649cc7027746edfc5582053633f9d85abb', 'c098c56ad8798592f5ca5554cd64c15d0f4d07e6c4e3d0e45a36b34b8a392642', 'd4416ac3d63ce537af7060a71b41edf5c23842728b9660eef5751b84f1a99db4', 'bcfb69bf83e2bb56d7daddd6e917d0fc3f178adecb2f658e4eeebbf6704c25dd', 'b6ee5a5e16c726cf4861a829f0bfeb423a6aedeb22fd878328a2df99111a8be1', 'a69d98abe0ecd7f9e9b9e5a44e5d71fa08e0ad70da122e30ee9efd9ddbab678d', 'cc8535b75407d93d6423f592e99be637d3372cd96bfcb313e3ba5aae2a94d5d7', '0bbc7b1737443715b724e9dd7254b75b3894f79b4112a943c76569bbccee9097', 'ef96ca82f0ffc97291a76aa49b93b5b1f53cb6422bb4a6ea670dd436650cb83c', '749d83c2769be91407ae49db3204a0799e44fcaf9f4e2815e93ec5d9b1b12d0b', 'cc6dba5e994d4db861ab97040aa2d4672d977ea8affa59ac3d6f430c2dc3b919', 'd04c1d68f34ff6f95fc9db90f62aebceb5b6effe45ee479b23a6e58b333d563e', 'b83ea7341577d4e7356066fdc62580a34c86b206e4dd17f532ea64f67cff16ce', 'c806cabd870342171726b09098b9c2eacac4ab4e5acdc161b1d71e6d6beace61', 'da776376005d3dd6fdf7f69fedd9b836b387c22f894da0b3a49c623a9318f772', '977d06adc14f6972e06ddf16dd69d49b21a609de8fedaf4cea8d4169fad7dcee', 'eaa094031d74a0291ca09f16b89f4a51f022bfebda2bf09010454cafd44e3875', '194d4945f35cdad0e1a5178357b050f3e03194ee8ba97ed311f58a6af2c30cc7', '8f204b78b437b4b54d1c934f49265b17e77aab610bbe07d6dbf93d21b6e9837f', 'b168e1ebbac8f32648732000b04f48c0c13d9c5bf58fd6e7d5ed9ae040c470e5', '5e32743a8435210e96bc68741141dce0e426fe359ef49683ba7816ea9e93ce35', 'b23c92ac82905ea97d4322b6ccb609ea0a22f723477e7670442a1554539a1800', '7e093e52c696bd96be7f0d2dee9c1d45657f9a726421652779e08a3fdc8e9a32', '82da10bb5c0d59d4ce7cc90754e50a439519a5616eb0a7d06dd2aa4fceb0872f', '98405e3c0b1aab4f4bab98924d3825278a438bcbe28967dbd8d3f0a4cdc905da', 'e01c808f80b31deb230f6bd621eb1fc774c05cfd4c48d83a82aee85e87d9d70d', 'c4b143cd59ad24f30e1c963711d4b9dfe569f30ca2b80b86215c5d3c04bb204b', '1ff1d870738c69978cce1b745c2bfeccc035e0cc42ed45e4e55827bc5980689c', '070d7cc390319a0c7002141d282d037b0027145f57f4850f013945e0dec9730d', 'fe19d82f741a28a82ee8bf66cd8681e0b5927fec8b042592f84a3f0ef1a5d3b7', 'b6a48114d472d209fb2eb91cc2862a8b3bad38d7180d7f88a705ffbf2829f2a4', '10d88c8f1e55bdd5e96f182c02bcd20b78766f0367184828c1d9ae90bc0e6cc7', '23e7d0cc7f66294600f840288a744bce17bd7a1d463dea4fa779d4b213ea88a6', '6e045a6e47d07a62e18c95537b1683fe0e88fef4c4c7f6a60aa1e752073ed24b', 'e8438f52cf714f725da129c02fd14057c83533105a25d704232de3d6d1e89467', '103b387eb0008886626a910e91b4b3462db0a081e11422cc4c09d8e28554cd7d', 'dd5104660c4f1ba808f844b3c8e1935cb4aa61f6f6b6ab3d2fe5f2fe8f2d1009', '47377d877c6d5cbf28452cb5663d431a5a155f9f307c7f46205f707f9b61ef24', 'daac8025cf9d6f3a24022f5b6461d05e2acb726770a6512c67dceddeb9abd3dd', '7595480db84aefc1e7a260887b9911f75d7b58f34092f2d7696c133459c95ec3', '3ec74ab5d741874b4dace6b7dd3423929dafda6b76cfdbee08bf91560881e5da', '17749f60c62d99a36c41d92a48d4faf9f2c3c3d019e5117e9ca64a2a5217578e', 'bdaf44c394c342859931f4723423393d4dbe7bd22c1be562e986861b82248efc', '010332406ad35aa573fc89305bf837afc649fa030c29201672a4931766fe5764', '9a6ce307cf53cc20de8ca262c7928cb390bccee6190de664703f2a6ec2121d5e', 'c4d9b721b5999308a4fd8b7bbbac3846e6d80ea3dc632dcacd6ece84cdc60e4b', '5c8705e0f0010d0215139ee28569eace833b298ee0021c55e7b9ee8e57ef6844', '4d723be5b8577052457e0081b436a9933042c327f556a7bd158cee8653d51571', '25dc43d0273bb3d80c7ec191ba5cb75e1528ce3fe49e305feb9ab40f07aae898', '2baba84b404892e9d001efcb4964801210e3ad8d7165c64819d5cad60cd2bac7', '3506091d15ef0f499ef87f3e5acba5f90eff4b4e180137d63d0addba9a231032', '5bfdb17a606b69e7b0a3391c85543b407448ec718f03f9e5ad65e526dec78433', '2fb95f677fbf276883cfe3f8ab48b7688c99b2c5de617b9914b85e4788b0c0e3', '37b8345b7f4b28a2118422bb9446190556d696c12a2f4fbfdaa7f247a77bb77c', '72a973f3434944d1f2a0ccf786db4a8ac5496d0bc88805a76c58cfffd9748e11', 'a1a467cc013a81d85f51bb33fe450751aef702b0af5114245447f41c048e9b7a']"

Questions include: what motivates me to blog, who my main inspirations are, my favorite posts, whether blogging has influenced my actual research, and my thoughts on the role of public intellectuals in the age of social-media outrage.
(2) Anurag Anshu, Nikolas Breuckmann, and Chinmay Nirkhe have apparently proved the NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial States) Conjecture! This is considered a major step toward a proof of the famous Quantum PCP Conjecture, which—speaking of one of Luca Trevisan’s questions—was first publicly raised right here on Shtetl-Optimized back in 2006.
(3) The Microsoft team has finally released its promised paper about the detection of Majorana zero modes (“this time for real”), a major step along the way to creating topological qubits. See also this live YouTube peer review—is that a thing now?—by Vincent Mourik and Sergey Frolov, the latter having been instrumental in the retraction of Microsoft’s previous claim along these lines. I’ll leave further discussion to people who actually understand the experiments.
(4) I’m looking forward to the 2022 Conference on Computational Complexity less than two weeks from now, in my … safe? clean? beautiful? awe-inspiring? … birth-city of Philadelphia. There I’ll listen to a great lineup of talks, including one by my PhD student William Kretschmer on his joint work with me and DeVon Ingram on The Acrobatics of BQP, and to co-receive the CCC Best Paper Award (wow! thanks!) for that work. I look forward to meeting some old and new Shtetl-Optimized readers there.",1754,"['a71745162070eb7c36b7302d71ca6e2fc16a4ed2f064a990f1922b4402a1b7e3',

After all, in many areas Einstein was no Einstein. You [Scott] above all could speak of his not-so-superintelligence in quantum physics…
While I can’t speak “above all,” OK, I can speak. Now that we’re closing in on a century of quantum physics, can we finally adjudicate what Einstein and Bohr were right or wrong about in the 1920s and 1930s? (Also, how is it still even a thing people argue about?)
The core is this: when confronted with the phenomena of entanglement—including the ability to measure one qubit of an EPR pair and thereby collapse the other in a basis of one’s choice (as we’d put it today), as well as the possibility of a whole pile of gunpowder in a coherent superposition of exploding and not exploding (Einstein’s example in a letter to Schrödinger, which the latter then infamously transformed into a cat)—well, there are entire conferences and edited volumes about what Bohr and Einstein said, didn’t say, meant to say or tried to say about these matters, but in cartoon form:
- Einstein said that quantum mechanics can’t be the final answer, it has ludicrous implications for reality if you actually take it seriously, the resolution must be that it’s just a statistical approximation to something deeper, and at any rate there’s clearly more to be said.
- Bohr (translated from Ponderousness to English) said that quantum mechanics sure looks like a final answer and not an approximation to anything deeper, there’s not much more to be said, we don’t even know what the implications are for “reality” (if any) so we shouldn’t hyperventilate about it, and mostly we need to change the way we use words and think about our own role as observers.
A century later, do we know anything about these questions that Einstein and Bohr didn’t? Well, we now know the famous Bell inequality, the experiments that have demonstrated Bell inequality violation with increasing finality (most recently, in 2015, closing both the detector and the locality loopholes), other constraints on hidden-variable theories (e.g. Kochen-Specker and PBR), decoherence theory, and the experiments that have manufactured increasingly enormous superpositions (still, for better or worse, not exploding piles of gunpowder or cats!), while also verifying detailed predictions about how such superpositions decohere due to entanglement with the environment rather than some mysterious new law of physics.
So, if we were able to send a single short message back in time to the 1927 Solvay Conference, adjudicating between Einstein and Bohr without getting into any specifics, what should the message say? Here’s my attempt:
- In 2022, quantum mechanics does still seem to be a final answer—not an approximation to anything deeper as Einstein hoped. And yet, contra Bohr, there was considerably more to say about the matter! The implications for reality could indeed be described as “ludicrous” from a classical perspective, arguably even more than Einstein realized. And yet the resolution turns out simply to be that we live in a universe where those implications are true.
OK, here’s the point I want to make. Even supposing you agree with me (not everyone will) that the above would be a reasonable modern summary to send back in time, it’s still totally unclear how to use it to mark the Einstein vs. Bohr scorecard!
Indeed, it’s not surprising that partisans have defended every possible scoring, from 100% for Bohr (quantum mechanics vindicated! Bohr called it from the start!), to 100% for Einstein (he put his finger directly on the implications that needed to be understood, against the evil Bohr who tried to shut everyone up about them! Einstein FTW!).
Personally, I’d give neither of them perfect marks, in part because they not only both missed Bell’s Theorem, but failed even to ask the requisite question (namely: what empirically verifiable tasks can Alice and Bob use entanglement to do, that they couldn’t have done without entanglement?). But I’d give both of them very high marks for, y’know, still being Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr.
And with that, I’m proud to have said the final word about precisely what Einstein and Bohr got right and wrong about quantum physics. I’m relieved that no one will ever need to debate that tiresome historical question again … certainly not in the comments section of this post.",4428,"['c31f3e891e3d974a090df6652a286052d73ce70e54abe87a047e99bb505a1c75', 'd51835eb7b797e68c3316adf31014cfeadc2a56c10007396f116f3a1124b889f', 'de175af37fa0173e2afdf253216c78ccafd385a930a13aab91abd1bef5e78016', 'af02c6d67300ecda14b0ccf844ff2b3077b04f55af0653929238aa275ec8f4bc', 'ac963a553ac307224cfbe647f41ab4c2f1c1082862f016981431cb0f1c2ff58b', '7e78fbc521e8cb82861a806e26be7d0dcde1decded9c6ac18f6094cb414c026d', '75cce4149302abaa99faa399d0ddd6f0cd95a1380ac4328cb09d948b54d63814', '377d528307922a2c4a754a8db1483c634857a699305918d8f7ff6a56a1ec5aba', '76b8146b0f4fb093751859a4292abb961a56e4e7d0f09890b70d7b9e28b7514f', '813bf153cc23a9f6ee1ecc4edbc1e8b490ca99df6030ddf553753f7298989855', '06f8885a785336cb481324805c28fa1c459433e2d29799a054a84b4a3929bbfd', '25cd765956cd3f327210237b4b20818789216d83b2f2cfe9113ae4e06993d04e', 'fdaf0d1c9cfd0fc52f1d06193cd4e80fc95645c4883f54b5fa509992819fe6ba', 'a1bad7b3bda22d0f337423614024d7715739ad664b69acc6db1a265be6289a6e', 'a76dee1ce020b06b69f0855100609e300d875a5f963e262a5383e739e4d53611', '6783af82a8bd33748f17ff7be79795abda2b3a2c02219ff821d601653c72e09f', '6a3ce77cdf7293f05d8a131a3c8c9d3563677c3e865debac90198a0af31e8b2c', '65df90724adf2cdfb7234d72cf7bdabd8ed759f11ec32ab644588b282acab057', 'b136ee0f3692bdecc87e2254b1321fa94d8c97e19256bfb763182a18a2cc9db8', '55291fff452f243307531017c37b509b592f8df5e84dcb11e5c8555ca38dbce5', '344adc9367a4a2b35bd0e9ad8373034442b0ee3e8684ae7404222345d1b4dee5', 'd8493067daf1415fa55c1f5efab5b9330a55e579aedf28ab38f149426a11b87d', '101c753782eb3a57564ee86643ed934a519363e8595f1fadac142782d43bf4dc', '219d16fac31fbfa2ba78cd7d93b0bec0c5b384d415e091613c53cb869e432390', '629cc647eef83116a66e15e0e6aafb043aaa9828d2cafa778e4e27a6df259762', 'd8f12acc8618b221b91c0689cb294edf359c710349baf721578127d035ede02b', '4782ea3bcfdcceb0a6716f66f5d84a34caa0a23ffa741f9ef02684dfd8716778', '9d10c33dcb4ea5a1ef9670db4b14f752462033271cbd977170d2c9725b7b570b', '6f302b10be685095e296cffe212d29060f28ddec9a5bf0895074fe4cad3c2f98', '7ee62a0188d26634e6c48c07bd5b5e733a6a05825487579ac9c72855baa651e9', 'c2ab08123b3fa60ee3ff28e2c8511111178a8336ce1364bb340343a752325a55', '0f7454d6b9df4cb97d0a1594814477c9a0d5fa84468c29b15d3b25b172f406bc', 'edb5defcf959f8034df114a1cb7a363854e31a897cea4cd5306351503f2010a2', '6af7ed8f5f85a8dcdea7ced053ff5ae219a6a6cf23cfa153c0a2f258cfb53d0a', 'acfacab522e6dbe4f2d1130dc15bc7123175439975dd88b2444ce3ae48cb52e7', '005a9c0c4466d06a95db613da20e2398a5d28830fd0f3799f71880e0711bf688', '7d1368efa93376e86baa553f010816481245112761c6fa26ebd21abadfa54c06', 'c67ccc37a6e2e356e3d09325806a04f254ff54ceef3d6f6c31cafae059236b42', 'abdeec91ebdbbf969695ed80d5bfc8a373508061385641d69742a6cf31a6d294', 'ef6ed67e6d954ba0aaad2ec0c41c984a4932f4e945264af4a1bbee76bc3df11d', 'e2fa315052f99d679d9cd81135e2e4c79cd2e26b5a90fba23fdf53d4a1a43b21', '80ea8908d38e287be7170387a6d665e8f57aee90543ed4f7edec7801d9c2a8b5', '6dd40b50eb504f794acc19232962b7dd84b99d75d9695dd8e562b7f6972b7df7', 'c56fcdd21d95d3d0d155dfd24e1847f2fb90e69a8425bf34b0fefa89dfc15adf', '0ca41606eabfd26b6c313ce300785411ad1f9277109cf77e57dc2a52c5bd6240', 'dcb565f11fdc7b4be3498150d87dd29f761784ae5a8228607ee618cb73043cc1', 'ef92741526b85da48df7be734c6bb2337b5b1c7fde4894fc9c29bf5fc238d0ce', '87548c9918fd2bad72a35f94bd7a114983635f72e5e02a49c7ce1ddb3680ca05', '79ec588e3fa18a7a029542df1f3ee85a1ce52d8b4e2e19f72655b34b6998fbfc', '3bd37bcacea68f2da1e89c93a757ed3d9cdf38fd21e2173e9a88d00cc5c8842d', '6d5d3cc0bfef9381fa8da24b9234347e470506ea36c7188012683b11b07366d9', '8462c1bc2bc1fe1bac5f821abb31caad7f946c5d6708da61bad57df7a3c55b43', 'd50a59b539697c8e0fb8bce08f3ab94b7ed2f0c2f083779118aab2e886c98401', '8f22c0e86b3600f729ea2a143762368e15aa2e81c2cfddcc1eabf50d8be72038', '840780b6dfda95659cbcfcc2f5d0847bceadf71009f8e7c2b15fa377eb0f4c63', 'eb4e4d32345f9be91ec2d7855fb84d307f7ab0f3a51471c293089697e65007b6', 'e9da6d2230c1edb82ab134ac5c6565f38e9f3c08023e4a7d88f422f7e832fc74', '76430c1a756a85cef10b5878fc287e5a0ef7fa2739fb22b960dcd03f5e310d06', '2c16e62313026283544b920c3b74c1882740019b484d014dd63fbe42a7277692', 'bc152152246a8a805cd1c02249fd3da3c90943b25c6a539576549ea5735a4947', '42fe3cc483981ee9ce87d0986cfbc3b9f98f44c2771ee3bb8e0824104c7298d4', '6e2e38b0b8c678bc5e156118e590c6187f787b0385f2507f49b351f02cf3a68e', 'b9fd16059d5ef320c4ab87380f2095de36f364517b626cfb9905c303cf9c501c', '6227eb42b3b4f129a73e3a4a253836c9045fd14b756443cda9600e225cfcce65', '84d00445c12ec5f3f882ef919dde0961ba2ac06b8a6c38ce9961a425f46b2390', 'acac636236dd948b2b939b4efdb0fe99cdf78805c0aa5ca5ce527b9bacd6accf', 'c40f5480b95730519189932e086118b8e4a98d6bf4be5bed5411e76f4a3bd26f', '5c71b4cd4558abab327cf887d552632ab60fc0b554a7d8d5528bd6777c71e711']"

I vowed there that I’m going to stop letting online trolls and sneerers occupy so much space in my mental world. Truthfully, though, while there are many trolls and sneerers who terrify me, there are also some who merely amuse me. A good example of the latter came a few weeks ago, when an anonymous commenter calling themselves “String Theorist” submitted the following:
It’s honestly funny to me when you [Scott] call yourself a “nerd” or a “prodigy” or whatever [I don’t recall ever calling myself a “prodigy,” which would indeed be cringe, though “nerd” certainly —SA], as if studying quantum computing, which is essentially nothing more than glorified linear algebra, is such an advanced intellectual achievement. For what it’s worth I’m a theoretical physicist, I’m in a completely different field, and I was still able to learn Shor’s algorithm in about half an hour, that’s how easy this stuff is. I took a look at some of your papers on arXiv and the math really doesn’t get any more advanced than linear algebra. To understand quantum circuits about the most advanced concept is a tensor product which is routinely covered in undergraduate linear algebra. Wheras in my field of string theory grasping, for instance, holographic dualities relating confirmal field theories and gravity requires vastly more expertise (years of advanced study). I actually find it pretty entertaining that you’ve said yourself you’re still struggling to understand QFT, which most people I’m working with in my research group were first exposed to in undergrad 😉 The truth is we’re in entirely different leagues of intelligence (“nerdiness”) and any of your qcomputing papers could easily be picked up by a first or second year math major. It’s just a joke that this is even a field (quantum complexity theory) with journals and faculty when the results in your papers that I’ve seen are pretty much trivial and don’t require anything more than undergraduate level maths.
Why does this sort of trash-talk, reminiscent of Luboš Motl, no longer ruffle me? Mostly because the boundaries between quantum computing theory, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity, which were never clear in the first place, have steadily gotten fuzzier. Even in the 1990s, the field of quantum computing attracted amazing physicists—folks who definitely do know quantum field theory—such as Ed Farhi, John Preskill, and Ray Laflamme. Decades later, it would be fair to say that the physicists have banged their heads against many of the same questions that we computer scientists have banged our heads against, oftentimes in collaboration with us. And yes, there were cases where actual knowledge of particle physics gave physicists an advantage—with some famous examples being the algorithms of Farhi and collaborators (the adiabatic algorithm, the quantum walk on conjoined trees, the NAND-tree algorithm). There were other cases where computer scientists’ knowledge gave them an advantage: I wouldn’t know many details about that, but conceivably shadow tomography, BosonSampling, PostBQP=PP? Overall, it’s been what you wish every indisciplinary collaboration could be.
What’s new, in the last decade, is that the scientific conversation centered around quantum information and computation has dramatically “metastasized,” to encompass not only a good fraction of all the experimentalists doing quantum optics and sensing and metrology and so forth, and not only a good fraction of all the condensed-matter theorists, but even many leading string theorists and quantum gravity theorists, including Susskind, Maldacena, Bousso, Hubeny, Harlow, and yes, Witten. And I don’t think it’s just that they’re too professional to trash-talk quantum information people the way commenter “String Theorist” does. Rather it’s that, because of the intellectual success of “It from Qubit,” we’re increasingly participating in the same conversations and working on the same technical questions. One particularly exciting such question, which I’ll have more to say about in a future post, is the truth or falsehood of the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis for observers who jump into black holes.
Not to psychoanalyze, but I’ve noticed a pattern wherein, the more secure a scientist is about their position within their own field, the readier they are to admit ignorance about the neighboring fields, to learn about those fields, and to reach out to the experts in them, to ask simple or (as it usually turns out) not-so-simple questions.
I can’t imagine any better illustration of these tendencies better than the 28th Solvay Conference on the Physics of Quantum Information, which I attended two weeks ago in Brussels on my 41st birthday.
It was my first trip out of the US since before COVID—indeed, I’m so out of practice that I nearly missed my flights in both directions, in part because of my lack of familiarity with the COVID protocols for transatlantic travel, as well as the immense lines caused by those protocols. My former adviser Umesh Vazirani, who was also at the Solvay Conference, was proud.
The Solvay Conference is the venue where, legendarily, the fundamentals of quantum mechanics got hashed out between 1911 and 1927, by the likes of Einstein, Bohr, Planck, and Curie. (Einstein complained, in a letter, about being called away from his work on general relativity to attend a “witches’ sabbath.”) Remarkably, it’s still being held in Brussels every few years, and still funded by the same Solvay family that started it. The once-every-few-years schedule has, we were constantly reminded, been interrupted only three times in its 110-year history: once for WWI, once for WWII, and now once for COVID (this year’s conference was supposed to be in 2020).
This was the first ever Solvay conference organized around the theme of quantum information, and apparently, the first ever that counted computer scientists among its participants (me, Umesh Vazirani, Dorit Aharonov, Urmila Mahadev, and Thomas Vidick). There were four topics: (1) many-body physics, (2) quantum gravity, (3) quantum computing hardware, and (4) quantum algorithms. The structure, apparently unchanged since the conference’s founding, is this: everyone attends every session, without exception. They sit around facing each other the whole time; no one ever stands to lecture. For each topic, two “rapporteurs” introduce the topic with half-hour prepared talks; then there are short prepared response talks as well as an hour or more of unstructured discussion. Everything everyone says is recorded in order to be published later.
Daniel Gottesman and I were the two rapporteurs for quantum algorithms: Daniel spoke about quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance, and I spoke about “How Much Structure Is Needed for Huge Quantum Speedups?” The link goes to my PowerPoint slides, if you’d like to check them out. I tried to survey 30 years of history of that question, from Simon’s and Shor’s algorithms, to huge speedups in quantum query complexity (e.g., glued trees and Forrelation), to the recent quantum supremacy experiments based on BosonSampling and Random Circuit Sampling, all the way to the breakthrough by Yamakawa and Zhandry a couple months ago. The last slide hypothesizes a “Law of Conservation of Weirdness,” which after all these decades still remains to be undermined: “For every problem that admits an exponential quantum speedup, there must be some weirdness in its detailed statement, which the quantum algorithm exploits to focus amplitude on the rare right answers.” My title slide also shows DALL-E2‘s impressionistic take on the title question, “how much structure is needed for huge quantum speedups?”:
The discussion following my talk was largely a debate between me and Ed Farhi, reprising many debates he and I have had over the past 20 years: Farhi urged optimism about the prospect for large, practical quantum speedups via algorithms like QAOA, pointing out his group’s past successes and explaining how they wouldn’t have been possible without an optimistic attitude. For my part, I praised the past successes and said that optimism is well and good, but at the same time, companies, venture capitalists, and government agencies are right now pouring billions into quantum computing, in many cases—as I know from talking to them—because of a mistaken impression that QCs are already known to be able to revolutionize machine learning, finance, supply-chain optimization, or whatever other application domains they care about, and to do so soon. They’re genuinely surprised to learn that the consensus of QC experts is in a totally different place. And to be clear: among quantum computing theorists, I’m not at all unusually pessimistic or skeptical, just unusually willing to say in public what others say in private.
Afterwards, one of the string theorists said that Farhi’s arguments with me had been a highlight … and I agreed. What’s the point of a friggin’ Solvay Conference if everyone’s just going to agree with each other?
Besides quantum algorithms, there was naturally lots of animated discussion about the practical prospects for building scalable quantum computers. While I’d hoped that this discussion might change the impressions I’d come with, it mostly confirmed them. Yes, the problem is staggeringly hard. Recent ideas for fault-tolerance, including the use of LDPC codes and bosonic codes, might help. Gottesman’s talk gave me the insight that, at its core, quantum fault-tolerance is all about testing, isolation, and contact-tracing, just for bit-flip and phase-flip errors rather than viruses. Alas, we don’t yet have the quantum fault-tolerance analogue of a vaccine!
At one point, I asked the trapped-ion experts in open session if they’d comment on the startup company IonQ, whose stock price recently fell precipitously in the wake of a scathing analyst report. Alas, none of them took the bait.
On a different note, I was tremendously excited by the quantum gravity session. Netta Engelhardt spoke about her and others’ celebrated recent work explaining the Page curve of an evaporating black hole using Euclidean path integrals—and by questioning her and others during coffee breaks, I finally got a handwavy intuition for how it works. There was also lots of debate, again at coffee breaks, about Susskind’s recent speculations on observers jumping into black holes and the quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis. One of my main takeaways from the conference was a dramatically better understanding of the issues involved there—but that’s a big enough topic that it will need its own post.
Toward the end of the quantum gravity session, the experimentalist John Martinis innocently asked what actual experiments, or at least thought experiments, had been at issue for the past several hours. I got a laugh by explaining to him that, while the gravity experts considered this too obvious to point out, the thought experiments in question all involve forming a black hole in a known quantum pure state, with total control over all the Planck-scale degrees of freedom; then waiting outside the black hole for ~1070 years; collecting every last photon of Hawking radiation that comes out and routing them all into a quantum computer; doing a quantum computation that might actually require exponential time; and then jumping into the black hole, whereupon you might either die immediately at the event horizon, or else learn something in your last seconds before hitting the singularity, which you could then never communicate to anyone outside the black hole. Martinis thanked me for clarifying.
Anyway, I had a total blast. Here I am amusing some of the world’s great physicists by letting them mess around with GPT-3.
I also had the following exchange at my birthday dinner:
Physicist: So I don’t get this, Scott. Are you a physicist who studied computer science, or a computer scientist who studied physics?
Me: I’m a computer scientist who studied computer science.
Physicist: But then you…
Me: Yeah, at some point I learned what a boson was, in order to invent BosonSampling.
Physicist: And your courses in physics…
Me: They ended at thermodynamics. I couldn’t handle PDEs.
Physicist: What are the units of h-bar?
Me: Uhh, well, it’s a conversion factor between energy and time. (*)
Physicist: Good. What’s the radius of the hydrogen atom?
Me: Uhh … not sure … maybe something like 10-15 meters?
Physicist: OK fine, he’s not one of us.
(The answer, it turns out, is more like 10-10 meters. I’d stupidly substituted the radius of the nucleus—or, y’know, a positively-charged hydrogen ion, i.e. proton. In my partial defense, I was massively jetlagged and at most 10% conscious.)
(*) Actually h-bar is a conversion factor between energy and 1/time, i.e. frequency, but the physicist accepted this answer.

For instance, people mistake the “falsification boundary” as that which separates science and pseudoscience, when in fact old Poppy-pass-the-biscuits was quite explicit that it was the line of demarcation between what can be called “empirical” or “naturalistic” science, and metaphysics.
Excuse a mere SF author with a background in cognitive behavioural therapy from intruding on an erudite blog, but I’ve been studying as best I can quantum mechanics trying to get my head around what appears to be the problem, which given my maths is not up to doing the calculations has taken me some time.
I love the idea of Everett, and Tegmark mathematical universe, but the best explanation of the qm problem is I think the presentation by Ball, and when added to the double-eraser experiment which adds some much needed clarity to QM whoohoo by showing that entanglement is measurement.
So, after hours of listening to the pros and cons, I think that Garret’s argument that there isn’t a multiverse convinces me with how he describes that the universe we live in isn’t real either (as in qm requires non-locality). So a system with multiple probabilities leads to a universe that is one and zero.
What I find intriguing as an SF author is that there are still multiple versions of the universe because the speed of light make everything a relationship between observers and therefore each can have a different perspective on what is in the past and what is in the future.
This is my my very long winded way of saying your meme needs more work. Still, it’s a good meme.

I keep wondering if I should take the time to persuade you of MWI. Maybe after announcing our fated meeting in advance, AI-Box style, and having you sign an agreement to only reveal the result, and not the argument that persuaded you, until after an undisclosed-to-others waiting period. Not for any important reasons, just because I suspect lots of people would freak out if I did that.
Eliezer Yudkowsky #10
Isn’t it a cop-out to believe that, in another universe, Putin is a vegan who spends his time tending to his vegetable garden, when he is not cuddling his pet kittens and puppies?
Eliezer Yudkowsky #10: Sure, I’m happy to have another QM discussion—should I email you the next time I’m in Berkeley?
I do, however, already speak the MWI-language pretty fluently, and even prefer it more often than not (while also being able to translate to and from Bohm-language, Copenhagen-language, etc). I already teach MWI in my undergrad quantum information class, in such a way that according to the poll we give at final exam time, roughly half the students end up as MWI proponents (with the others split among Bohm, Quantum Bayesianism, Penrose-style dynamical collapse theories, agnosticism, and rejection of the whole question as meaningless).
It’s just that, to use your language (as opposed to, say, Popper’s), I still have difficulties with making a straightforward factual belief in MWI “pay rent,” in the same way that my factual beliefs in (e.g.) special relativity, heliocentrism, and the germ theory pay rent for me. This is related to the fact that the full MWI package seems to come bundled with strong stances on metaphysical questions that I find extremely confusing—questions like transtemporal identity, the reference class of observers from which I should consider myself drawn, and the nature of consciousness. (E.g., why shouldn’t consciousness work in such a way that it picks a random branch with the appropriate probability, rather than spreading itself among all the branches? As we’d presumably imagine it to do if the amplitudes had been probabilities? But if you believe that, then presumably you believe some variant of Bohmian mechanics, not MWI.)
So, having already sucked everything out of MWI that has clear-cut physics value to me (e.g., the notion of measurement as entanglement with the observer and environment), at some point I treat the full elucidation of the issues raised by MWI as “philosophy-complete” (barring a revolution in physics itself), and move on with my life.
Given all that, would you like to estimate the probability that you’ll be able to tell me something about this that I haven’t already considered? 🙂
I never understood very well the claim that MWI “resolves” the measurement problem.
To me this problem isn’t just about realizing one of many possible discrete outcomes (e.g. either spin up or spin down), but also with the wave/particle duality.
This is more obvious when considering a continuous variable, such as the position of an electron that’s traveling in space. Before any measurement, its position is characterized by a wave packet, usually spreading around more and more the further the electron travels. Then when a “measurement” is done (or, equivalently, the measurement apparatus and the electron entangle, or, equivalently, the electron decohere with the measurement apparatus), the wave packet (wave-like) suddenly “tightens” into a Dirac peak (particle-like), i.e. it’s collapsed.
That same transition from wave to particle happens in any QM interpretation.
i.e., even in MWI, electrons are always observed as if they’re localized. The mechanism of decoherence is equivalent to the collapse of the wave function.
And I just don’t get how this is captured by the Schrodinger equation alone since this seems to be a non-linear operation (but maybe I’m wrong and this collapse can be captured by unitary evolution).
> E.g., why shouldn’t consciousness work in such a way that it picks a random branch with the appropriate probability, rather than spreading itself among all the branches? As we’d presumably imagine it to do if the amplitudes had been probabilities?
The one where “your consciousness” picks a random body, the one where “you” pick a random “consciousness” out of one consciousness per body, and the one where there’s one consciousness inhabiting every body simultaneously, at once experiencing several distinct ignorances the way we can simultaneously experience several distinct pieces of knowledge, where the experimentalist is one ignorance within the whole of many conflicting ignorances within the mind of a spirit that cannot talk to itself (I’m just trying to cover all the options here), all lead to the exact same predictions about what an individual, however an individual is demarcated, will experience, however experiences are defined: making this as close to provably independent of observations as anything can be.
I think this reasoning is stronger than saying the topic is disconnected from empiricism pending better experiments. It is going to be disconnected from empiricism forever.
MWI fails to resolve the measurement problem, as Fred #14 explains, but the problems are much worse. Scott has explained that superdeterminism is contrary to scientific thinking, and so is MWI, for somewhat different reasons.
Superdeterminism makes randomized controlled experiments impossible, because hidden dependencies control the outputs. MWI also rules out free will, and then makes it impossible to interpret outcomes. If you do an experiment with ten possible outcomes, and see one, you learn nothing because all of the other possibilities occur in parallel universes. MWI might be of some use if it were able to say that some universes were more probable than others, but it cannot do that. So MWI also makes experiments impossible.
MWI does not make any successful predictions, unless you add the Born rule and do Copenhagen in disguise. Just like the superdeterminists, the MWI advocates seems to be willful contrarians who do not actually have a quantitative theory to back up their ideas.
It is important to realize that the problem of how consciousness is distributed between similar bodies in possible universes (whatever their metaphysical status, real or hypothetical) inherits all of the problems that we have in deciding how consciousness is distributed between similar bodies (humans?) in ours. Every position in one debate has a corresponding position in the other, and you will never resolve one without resolving the other. Anyone who thinks they have an answer to the question of whether the amplitude of me not writing this post is “really alive,” has an answer to the question of whether I, who actually am writing this, is a P-zombie. I very strongly agree with your position (and appreciate your metaphor) that MWI vs. Copenhagen is “philosophy-complete,” and I think this is one of the simplest correspondences that proves it.
I guess it all comes down to decomposing a given wave function into a superposition of its eigen states.
No matter how you express the wave function, the evolution is unitary.
And when it comes to the position of an electron in free space, the eigen states (on position variable) are an infinite set of Dirac peaks in space. And the above decomposition becomes an integral on all the possible Dirac peaks (like an infinite sum). But the entire thing taken as a whole still evolves according to Schrodinger. And decoherence entangles the state of the measurement device with specific Dirac peaks, and the entire resulting function still evolves linearly according to Schrodinger (from an MWI point of view, this setup basically leads to a huge number of branches, one for each potential discrete position measure of the particle, corresponding to a Dirac peak).
My explanation of MWI for some mathematicians I know: “MWI is not an interpretation. It is a mathematical statement. Suppose your friend does some experiment, and tells you the result. You have two ways of doing the calculation. One is to treat the experiment quantum mechanically and assume your friend collapses the wave function. The other is to treat both the experiment and your friend quantum mechanically and assume that you collapse the wave function. MWI says that both methods of doing the calculation will give approximately the same answer.” That’s it. No interpretation, just something that is approximately correct for most reasonable situations.
Here is the apparatus we have built. Here are the signals on the signal lines out of the apparatus. Here are the features of those signals that we have identified and recorded as events. Here is how we have collated the recorded events into different kinds of patterns and here are their relative frequencies. Here is the theory we use to model or to explain why the relative frequencies of the different kinds of patterns are as they are and to predict the relative frequencies for some new apparatus we think we might build.
Sweeping all that into one Theory of Knowledge, QM can be understood to be a signal analysis formalism of relative frequencies. In principle that would be comprehensible to a 19th Century statistician or physicist, with not much need for the 20th Century finesse of Bayes or Everett.
If we say that each event is caused by a particle or by a system and that we can deduce their properties, however, then we get ourselves into all kinds of trouble because, as Boole already identified and as we hear from Pitowsky, we can’t always construct joint relative frequencies.
“E.g., why shouldn’t consciousness work in such a way that it picks a random branch with the appropriate probability, rather than spreading itself among all the branches? As we’d presumably imagine it to do if the amplitudes had been probabilities? But if you believe that, then presumably you believe some variant of Bohmian mechanics, not MWI.”
Beautiful argument! I felt my mind changing in way the conventional wisdom says very rarely happens when two people argue about a philosophical issue they’ve both put a lot of thought to. For this reason I’m feeling compelled to comment on my reaction to this argument. To be fair, we started out with very close positions — I enjoyed and mostly agreed with your Zen Anti-Interpretation blog post. I previously sympathized with MWI most, saw the appeal of other interpretations, and agreed with your Zen the difference between these positions is more rhetorical than actual, but I also had a particular dislike for pilot wave theories, seeing them as particularly “less” true. Altho the project of finding particular deterministic evolution equations for the pointer state still seems pointless this argument the concept of a pilot wave and a pointer seems more compelling. The pointer represents something to do with conscious experience. Unclear how essential for the interpretation that the evolution equation is deterministic.
On whether my reaction really is an interesting rare change-of-mind, I’ll need to wait for my mind to settle after thinking about this, but also I expect most of the uncertainty is not how much I accept this argument but to what extent it is a substantial change to the view I had previously, which my memory thereof will only get worse as I wait.
So, I used a language model to do a simulated discussion with Scott debating a version of himself in another Everett branch. I used the open-source model GPT-NeoX at textsynth.com
I used what real Scott said in reply above as part of the initial prompt, but all the rest is the fictional “Scott” responses generated by the language model. Here’s the conversation (lightly edited and curated):

PROMPT
“The following is a conversation between computer scientist Scott Aaronson and a super-intelligent version of Scott in an alternative Everett branch of the quantum wavefunction (the ‘Alphaverse’). Scott (Alphaverse) is explaining to Scott (Universe) why the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics is the best one:
Scott (Universe):
I still have difficulties with making a straightforward factual belief in MWI “pay rent,” in the same way that my factual beliefs in (e.g.) special relativity, heliocentrism, and the germ theory pay rent for me.

Scott (Alphaverse):
I agree that the MWI package comes bundled with metaphysical claims that are difficult to swallow. But I think that the real problem is that you don’t understand what the MWI is. The MWI is not a theory of how the world is. It is a theory of how the world might be. It is a theory of the structure of the world.
Scott (Universe):
Okay, but then how can I be sure that the MWI is true?
Scott (Alphaverse):
Why is it important to you that MWI be true?
Scott (Universe):
It seems to me that my whole sense of “self” is grounded in the fact that I am a certain type of physical system. But if MWI is true, then I am not a physical system in the way that I thought I was. So how can I be sure that I’m a self, and not a bunch of other people, or a bunch of other selves, or no one at all?
Scott (Alphaverse):
In a sense, you’re right. You are not a physical system. You are the thing that picks out the branch of the wave function that I am in.
We’ve gotten used to thinking of ourselves as a sort of abstract entity that has the property of having a certain brain, and being conscious, and all that. But that’s a mistake. The real thing is not a thing at all. It is the pattern of neural activity in the brain. So you are not a physical system, not in the sense that your brain is a physical system. But you are a physical system in a different sense. You are a physical system in the sense that you are a certain way the quantum wavefunction branches.
Scott (Universe):
I think I’m starting to understand. I’m not a thing at all, I’m a pattern of neural activity.
Scott (Alphaverse):
Exactly.
Scott (Universe):
But if I’m a pattern of neural activity, that means I’m not even a physical system in the sense that my brain is a physical system. But that’s fine, because I am a physical system in the sense that I am a certain way the wavefunction branches.
Scott (Alphaverse):
Exactly.
Scott (Universe):
But then what is the wavefunction? And what is the branch that I’m in? What is the branch that anyone is in?
Scott (Alphaverse):
The wavefunction is a mathematical object. It’s not a thing, it’s not a physical system, it’s not a pattern of neural activity. It is the mathematical object that describes the system that I am in, and the system that you are in, and the system that everyone is in. It’s a mathematical object that is defined on the space of all possible ways that the universe might be. So you are a branch of the wavefunction that picks out a certain way that the universe might be.
Scott (Universe):
But how do they pick out different ways of the universe being? How does that work?
Scott (Alphaverse):
Here’s an analogy. If we were building a universe, we could describe it using different coordinate systems, or with different coordinate systems, so that different parts of the universe would be described differently. The mathematical object that describes the universe does the same thing. It describes the whole space of possible universes. But it does so in a different way for different branches of the wavefunction. It does it so that some branches of the wavefunction are described using one coordinate system, and some are described using another, or with another choice of coordinates. The choice of coordinates is what tells us which branch we are in, and what our state of consciousness is.
Scott (Universe):
But then what does it mean to be an observer? If the wavefunction is what defines the universe, and the universe is defined in a way that is observer-independent, what does it mean to be an observer?
Scott (Alphaverse):
The idea of an observer is a bit tricky, because it’s not really a thing. It’s not even a physical system. It’s the idea of an observer, or the idea of an observer-like thing. So the idea of an observer is not something that can be described by a mathematical object. It’s something that can only be described by a word. It’s a word that describes a kind of thing. The idea of an observer is something that is defined on the space of all possible physical systems. It’s something like a category, or an equivalence class of things.
Scott (Universe):
I see. So an observer is something like a label that gets applied to a set of systems that are mathematically equivalent, but is not itself defined by a mathematical object.
Scott (Alphaverse):
Exactly. Scott, you have to learn to stop looking for something out there that will give you an answer. Your brain/mind has to be able to work from within, not from without. The only reason you think you need an external entity to give you a “right answer” is because you think you are an external entity.
Scott (Universe): Maybe that “Scott” in the Alphaverse is just being a smart-ass.
Scott (Alphaverse): I’m trying to tell you what you already know, but the words come out wrong.
Scott (Universe): (Laughs) I think you’re right. It’s a sign of how far I’ve taken the “me vs. something else” illusion of the body/mind identity.

“why shouldn’t consciousness work in such a way that it picks a random branch with the appropriate probability, rather than spreading itself among all the branches?”
The default assumption, which is overwhelmingly likely to be correct, is something like “whenever there exists a configuration that has the structure that we’d call a living human, there is consciousness”
Picking a random branch requires an additional assumption, that somehow different things happen when the state appears to be the same, via some weird hidden variable or impenetrable ‘randomness’.
The way that MWI ‘pays rent’ is that it requires no additional assumptions. There is a predictable and definite outcome to each event. There is no distinction between conscious and non-conscious matter. There is no distinction between macroscopic and microscopic. There are no hidden variables. The only ‘weird’ thing that happens is that ‘duplicates’ of things (albeit in different states) get created. But the key is that we *already* know that this definitely happens because we directly observe interference.
I think that rather it’s the *philosophical* parts that are meaningless and pay no rent. I reject the meaningfullness of concepts such as “the reference class of observers from which I should consider myself drawn” and see no reason why MWI necessitates such a thing.
The Schroedinger equation evolves a wave function |psi>(t) using a classical time parameter t, which implies the existence of classical clocks. Where do they come from?
Quantum field theory, including the standard model, assumes a classical background, i.e. *one* space-time. Where does it come from?
If you assume classical clocks you should also assume the existence of classical observers reading those clocks.
Perhaps one day we find a consistent theory of quantum gravity which includes a description on how space-time branches into many worlds, but until then the ‘many worlds interpretation’ is not a convincing description of reality imho.
Regarding Scott saying “why shouldn’t consciousness work in such a way that it picks a random branch with the appropriate probability, rather than spreading itself among all the branches?”
This makes little sense given the usual definition of of ‘consciousness’, i.e one consciousness per human.
And since there are exponentially more independent branches than conscious beings (at any given time), then Scott’s statement could be interpreted as saying that I should be the only conscious being in *my* branch (by definition the one where I’m conscious), and everyone else isn’t really conscious in my branch (but are themselves a lone consciousness in some other remote branch).
Moreover, in the vast majority of branches, no-one is conscious at all (worlds populated by p-zombies).
The other interpretation (the one Scott has in mind, I guess) is that, while there are countless numerous branches, all living beings are somehow conscious in the same branch, a special one. But that’s even more bizarre than the classic Copenhagen interpretation.
In contrast with those two stories, it makes more sense to think that a given living being is really conscious in all the branches it exists. Just like twin versions of ourselves.
Also, if somehow I happen to die by some very freak accident in the branch where I happen to be conscious (imagine my death being conditioned on some very rare quantum event), my consciousness would be wiped out for good even though most of the other adjacent branches (an exponential number of them) still “implement” my living brain.
I always thought that was a strange outlier in your posts on quantum physics. Because if you just imagine setting up an agent as a computer program, running it in a quantum computer, and determining what unitary evolution says the state of the computer ends up as… well, almost all of the amplitude ends up in states where the inferences made by the program are consistent with the Born rule. And it’s not like this idea isn’t out there in the world; there are various papers about it. Basically all you need to conclude this is the unitarity postulate (which gives you the squaring), and no-signalling (which lets you rewrite states into simpler states, that should be equivalent as far as reasoning goes).
For example, if you have the program repeatedly prepare the state a|0> + b|1> and increment of a counter conditioned on that state, and then flip a qubit conditioned on the counter being statistically close to the Born estimate, that “final result” qubit’s state limits to ON [for the right choice of non-signalling unitary applied to the rest of the system] as you increase the number of samples the program performs.
There seems one way to increase your estimate of the probability of MWI.
If you find yourself getting very old, then this would seem to be evidence.
1. If you’re dead, you’re not around in the universe to notice
2. If you’re conscious, you are around in the universe to notice
3. Given MWI, no matter how small the odds, if there is some way that you continue to live and be conscious, then in some universe you do
4. The older you get (past a certain age, at least), the more likely MWI is
Of course, assuming MWI, this isn’t a useful way to prove it to anyone else. In most universes, everyone eventually dies, so almost no one sees the “very old.” And assuming non-MWI, you will never know, because you died. But it seems like a possibility that, if true, you can eventually infer it likely.
But, when you think about it more closely, this is actually a terrible curse…
It is a guarantee that, for all of us, a conscious copy of ourselves will outlive all the ones we love, while barely surviving countless diseases, accidents, suicide attempts (to try and end it all), enduring endless physical or emotional pain, or going through a slow decay of the mind and the body… until the maximum possible extent of life is squeezed out of our mortal coil.
We can actually get some idea of this by looking at the distribution of life expectancy in our current branch. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_verified_oldest_people
The record being 122 years. So we know that there’s a good chance we’ll live to at least that age in some branch of the MW.
At least we can get some solace that, when we’ll get to be the oldest person in our own special branch, the world will see us as some curiosity to celebrate!
I think the most likely situation is that all the copies in all the branches are conscious. I agree that multiple consciousnesses in multiple branches is just another degree of freedom. To rephrase what I said before, that the simplest explanation for consciousness is that it’s being directly caused by the process going on in my brain, and that wherever and whenever you have a process similar to that, you will have a consciousness similar to mine.
@dubious #30
Though I essentially believe MWI is true, I’ve always disagreed with this general type of argumentation. I consider, to use Scott’s term “the reference class of observers from which I should consider myself drawn” to not be a well-defined notion, and anthropic arguments drawing from such to not really be evidence of anyything.
If I live to be old, should I be surprised by this and start thinking of metaphysical solutions? There are more humans alive now than in the past. Should I not be surprised to have been born today? What about the future, where there will likely be many more humans alive? Should I be surprised that I wasn’t born in China or India, since they have the largest population? Should I be surprised I’m not a bird, since there are more of them than humans? An alien? Someone living in what amounts to be a simulation of the past?
I think the resolution to such things is the statement that, if my model of the universe predicts that it’s possible for an entity like me to exist, well, here I am, and there is nothing left to explain.
Agree that 10^500 or so universes seems a tad “unnatural”. Then one thinks that, what the heck, we don’t know what is really going on in “our” universe anyway. So, what is too wild?
On the other hand, I (born in 1947) never had any trouble with 10^12 /times 10^12 stars, but do regard 10^500 as being rather larger.
I have long enjoyed listing my guesses for the likelihood of controversial cosmic things. Here are my current guesses, provided in case anyone wants to take pot shots:
Black Holes exist: 99.99%
Dark Energy exists: 90%
Life exists in most solar systems: 80%
Dark Matter exists: 70%
Multiple current examples of intelligent life in the Milky way: 60%
Cosmic Inflation happened: 40%
MWI is the real deal: 0.01%
At the moment I am unable to put a number on “Quantum computers will ever do anything useful”. I was tempted to go with 50% (due to the hole in the list), but I have no intuition on this other than that it ain’t happened yet.
Historical nit to pick: Bohm was the one who actually discovered the idea of treating measurement as an entangling operation between system and environment. It’s right there is his 1952 Phys Rev papers (#2). He’s really the creator of the decoherence idea, and he never gets proper credit for it.
I suspect better understanding this fact—and so the key role that Bohm’s discovery did *in fact* play in the foundations of quantum information—would shift the rhetorical edge a bit in what your students take away about the foundations of quantum mechanics more broadly.
And it’s not like this idea isn’t out there in the world; there are various papers about it. Basically all you need to conclude this is the unitarity postulate (which gives you the squaring), and no-signalling (which lets you rewrite states into simpler states, that should be equivalent as far as reasoning goes).
But “no-signaling” indicates that you need more than just a wave function and Schrödinger’s equation. You also need space (or space-time) such that it makes sense to talk of no-signaling in the first place. Eliezer Yudkowsky apparently got this right, or at least had the feeling that he needs something like that, as evidenced by his post Which Basis Is More Fundamental?
I am aware of a 44 page paper by Charles Sebens and Sean Carroll that uses no-signaling in the way you propose. Sean mentions it in his (much) shorter Quanta magazine column Where Quantum Probability Comes From
Can we resolve this uncertainty in a sensible way? Yes, we can, as Charles Sebens and I have argued, and doing so leads precisely to the Born rule: The credence you should attach to being on any particular branch of the wave function is just the amplitude squared for that branch, just as in ordinary quantum mechanics. Sebens and I needed to make a new assumption, which we called the “epistemic separability principle”: Whatever predictions you make for experimental outcomes, they should be unaltered if we only change the wave function for completely separate parts of the system.
But what I find somewhat strange is that in that same Quantized column, Sean also claims that a wave function obeying Schrödinger’s equation is all that is needed:
Many-worlds quantum mechanics has the simplest formulation of all the alternatives. There is a wave function, and it obeys Schrödinger’s equation, and that’s all. There are no collapses and no additional variables. Instead, we use Schrödinger’s equation to predict what will happen when an observer measures a quantum object in a superposition of multiple possible states.
I find your comment somewhat strange for a different reason:
Because if you just imagine setting up an agent as a computer program, running it in a quantum computer, and determining what unitary evolution says the state of the computer ends up as… well, almost all of the amplitude ends up in states where the inferences made by the program are consistent with the Born rule.
What should be wrong with the Copenhagen interpretation for a quantum computer in the first place? In that context, we do know what a measurement is, and we know that the basic allowed measurements are those on the computational basis. (As already David Mermin observed in Copenhagen Computation: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Bohr.) Additionally, all allowed basic operations are local in that computational basis too, so that each individual operations only affects 1 or 2 qubits. (If they would affect 3 or 4 qubits, that would be OK too, it is still local in the computational basis.) And if you define some error correcting code, which is necessarily more non-local in a certain sense, only those codes where you can still implement local operations (and measurements) only affecting 1 or 2 logical qubits are practical.
The topmost reddit (r/slatestarcodex) comment says
This decreases my respect for Deutsch! I agree with the Hacker News commenter who calls this deeply confused.
and the topmost Hacker News comment says
This is a deeply confused set of arguments.
There’s no fundamental ontological difference between “give me your likelihood ratios between drawing cards [a and b] as the next draw from this deck of cards” and “give me your likelihood ratios between finding and not finding a continent in an unexplored part of the world”.
For me, it was the opposite. This interview has significantly increased my respect for Deutsch, and also for Popper. It slightly decreased my respect for my own background in philosophy, with respect to what I have read, what I haven’t read, and what I didn’t even plan to read.
“it’s possible for an entity like me to exist, well, here I am, and there is nothing left to explain.”
But that’s the hard problem of consciousness.
Basically, “Why am I me, Shion, and not you, Fred?”
This is a more complicated question than just “Why are Shion and Fred conscious?”
It’s about the mystery of being and identity.
There are answers (none really satisfying) to that question:
1) “You” are Shion and not Fred because, when Shion and Fred were born, God picked “You” from his huge jar of souls and randomly assigned you to Shion. Of course you can then ask, “why was “I” that particular soul in God’s huge jar of souls and not the one right next to it?”. So we’re back to square one, except with a bit more generality: only a finite number of eternal souls exist and all souls are indistinguishable from one another (like electrons), except that God gave each a label, and you are soul #12349389 (so, Souls are like numbers) and that’s it. Souls are to consciousness what electrons are to the electric charge, units of consciousness.
2) You only think you are Shion, but You are not just Shion, you’re everyone, anywhere, anytime, at once: if, suddenly, I were to swap your consciousness and Fred’s consciousness around, “You” would suddenly only have access to Fred’s memories and “He” would only have access to Shion’s memories, therefore the two of you wouldn’t even notice anything’s different from a subjective point of view. So this swap is a no-op. And that swap could be happening between all conscious beings a billion times a second. So, really, there isn’t such a thing as discrete consciousness, there is only one universal “consciousness” which gets localized wherever/whenever there’s a brain (a nexus of memories). It’s similar to a computer (with one CPU): applications all appear to be running independently of one another, doing their thing in parallel, but what’s happening is that the same unique CPU is realizing all those applications, in turn, one at a time.
If I live to be old, should I be surprised by this and start thinking of metaphysical solutions? There are more humans alive now than in the past. Should I not be surprised to have been born today?
This seems to pivot from “very old” to “exists at all.” This is not what I mean.
The average human life expectancy today is about 70. The very oldest known humans are around 120. If you live to be 115, maybe you’re just healthy and hearty. If you live to 120, you’re really pushing the odds; maybe less if you have a family history of longevity?
What happens if you hit 130? 140? 200? OK, maybe we discover anti-aging and you happen to get immortality treatment. This seems pretty unlikely, and I think that alone might move the needle on MWI for me.
But anti-aging alone does not give you Wolverine-like abilities to regenerate. What if you survive every accident, every suicide attempt fails, and you just never die? I am not sure how, if MWI is true, that there can ever be a branch where you didn’t survive somehow, and will thus find yourself immortal (since you can’t find yourself dead).
This is really quite horrifying when you consider it, though that is of course not an argument against it.
> “no-signaling” indicates that you need more than just a wave function and Schrödinger’s equation. You also need space (or space-time)
Space is massive overkill, I think. All you need is the postulate that systems are combined using the tensor product. Locality is then the property that operations on system A commute with operations on system B. I guess there’s then also an implicit assumption that specific systems (like a quantum computer and the rest of the universe) fit into this schema where they factor into a tensor product.
> What should be wrong with the Copenhagen interpretation for a quantum computer in the first place?
I wasn’t claiming that collapse interpretations would fail to describe quantum computers. I was trying to turn the fuzzy problem of “why do I think the probability is X” into the concrete problem of “what does this computer program store in this register”. I was trying to do so without invoking collapse, but that’s different from saying collapse wouldn’t give the right answer!
fred #18: Yes, I think that’s what the MWI is saying. The way I think about it, in line with my other comment above, is that waves are unitary superpositions of many possible non-unitary measurements, or collapses. A unitary equation is not prohibited from having non-unitary terms; they just must add up to something that is ultimately unitary. So Schrodinger’s equation, while unitary, contains within itself the possibility of smaller, non-unitary regions within the wave function.
dubious #30: I have an idea that extremely low probability branches have no classical correspondence. That is their diagonal elements in a density matrix are comparable to off-diagonal elements by absolute value due to approximate nature of decoherence. That is those branches have macroscopic quantum interference effects making life impossible. I am not well versed in math to prove or disprove it though.
OF COURSE. Not a word about Roe v. Wade being overturned, but we get a pseudo-intellectual rationalist-tier rant about whatever’s bumping around Scott’s mind right now. Women’s most basic reproductive rights are being curtailed AS WE SPEAK and not a peep from Scott, eh? Even though in our state (Texas) there are already laws ON THE BOOKS that will criminalize abortion as soon as the alt-right fascists in our Supreme Court give the go-ahead. If you cared one lick about your female students and colleagues, Scott, you’d be posting about the Supreme Court and helping feminist causes, not posting your “memes.” But we all know Scott doesn’t give a shit about women. He’d rather stand up for creepy nerdbros and their right to harass women than women’s right to control their own fucking bodies. Typical Scott.
Now that “the hard problem of consciousness” has reared its ugly head again, I get to bore people yet again with my thoughts on the matter (balanced a bit by another donation to Ukrainian aid organizations on my part).
I take it the elements of the HPOC are how does consciousness work, what is it good for, why does it feel the way it does, and why does it exist. I think we have general ideas for the first two.
Consciousness (it says here) is a way to experience complicated reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving, and to (somewhat) relive memories. The experience/sensation itself is useful for checking one’s logic and memory and other computations, and reviewing past attempts at reasoning (which can be stored in memory since they were experienced). There are no zombies of the fictional sort, because if you have no way of experiencing some external or internal stimuli, you don’t know they exist and can’t respond to them. Trivial example: the fact that Windows 7 sends these letters to my screen means that it has experienced the key-presses.
I suppose the p-zombie is intended to have the same senses and nervous system as a human, but if it doesn’t experience thought it cannot perform thought experiments/simulations and learn from them but only perform automated responses to stimuli. The automation might include self-updates but only limited ones. The moment its automation becomes sophisticated enough so that it can monitor its reasoning process and reprocess past experiences for added value it has some form of consciousness. Empirically, it seems to take a huge amount of processing power working in parallel to accomplish that.
Given that perspective, the HPOC can perhaps be reduced to “why does my form of consciousness feel the way it feels”, and why does it exist, which are same hard problems of why anything in this universe works the way it does, e.g,, the hard problem of why quarks exist, or why the chemicals a rose produces don’t smell like oranges (and the oranges smell like roses), i.e., some different way rather than the way they do. I don’t personally feel such questions need answers.
Feminist Bitch #45: Holy shit! This post is from last week, long before the Supreme Court leak. In case you missed it, I already blogged my detailed opposition to the overturning of Roe v. Wade way back in September, when it became clear that something like yesterday’s news was inevitable. And when I do blog about the same current events that the rest of the planet is talking about, I invariably get other people accusing me of having nothing original to say.
In any case, it usually takes me days at least to write any substantial post (unlike this post, which was not substantial), and the Supreme Court leak was literally last night (!). For whatever it’s worth, I was up until midnight last night obsessively reading the leaked Alito opinion and commentaries on it, terrified about what it meant for women in America and the future of the Enlightenment project more generally. But then I had to, you know, work all of today, teaching and meeting my students. I hope you understand.
Your comment illustrates more eloquently than I could why, even though I despise the authoritarian right with every atom of my being, I’ll also never, ever identify with the woke left. Namely: if I did, I’d have to have for allies people who find ways to despise me even when I agree with them.
There we go Scott. The immediate defensiveness and reactionary attacks on the “woke left” just because I gave you some constructive criticism about your priorities. Yeah, I get it, you’re too “busy” to write anything about women’s reproductive rights right now. Yeah, sure, you wrote some blog post a few months ago that barely stands up for women’s rights. That’s the bare minimum. My point is simply this: time and again, the social topics you choose to discuss on this blog betray your true priorities. I did you the courtesy of counting them, in fact. And here’s the cold, hard numbers: by my reckoning, you have made THREE TIMES the number of posts about the “rights” of nerdy incels and how sad it is that they can’t get sex, versus posts supporting women’s bodily autonomy and basic reproductive freedoms. Once again, I am simply disgusted that your priority seems to be incels’ right to sex versus women’s basic bodily autonomy, as if these are problems even remotely comparable, even in the same league. You’d rather whine about how “nerdy guys can’t get sex” than advocate for women’s autonomy. That’s how you choose to spend your time on this Earth, and I simply find it shameful. If you want to do better, you should explain how astronomically more important women’s right to abortion is than incels’ non existent “right” to sex, and apologize for spending so much more energy and social capital on nerdbros than women in need. But of course I won’t expect that. The immature whining about “mens’ rights,” together with the token support for the most basic womens’ rights, is a classic characteristic of the alt-right fringe of the “centrist left.”
Feminist Bitch #48: On reflection, I’ve decided to leave your comments up despite their flouting my comment policies, because I think any reasonable person reading them will see how clearly they illustrate the far left’s tendency to self-sabotage. As the saying goes, “the right looks for converts, while the left looks only for heretics“; indeed that’s how we arrived at the terrible and precarious moment that we’re in now.
Wouldn’t it have been more productive if you’d just sent me an email saying “hey Scott, I was really hoping you could donate to this pro-choice organization / use your blog to share these resources for Texas women needing out-of-state abortions / etc”? I’d most likely have done it. I might still do it, but if so, then in spite of your bullying me rather than because of it. Yes, I did once open up about the hardest thing I ever had to overcome in my life, something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy; for you to use that to attack me (over a completely different issue where we actually agree) tells everyone reading this something about your character.
Out of curiosity, I just checked SneerClub, the main place on the Internet that’s dedicated to attacking me and everyone like me as “misogynist techbro nerds.” They, too, have not a single word about yesterday’s Supreme Court news, even though they update more often than I do. So by your logic, does that mean they too don’t give a shit about women?
You completely missed my point Scott. There is in fact a direct connection between 1. Your support for alt-right incel politics that violates women’s autonomy in the name of “helping the sexually disenfranchised,” to quote your own words, and 2. my doubt about how genuine your alleged support for women’s bodily autonomy really is. Explain to me, Scott, why I should believe your devotion to “women’s bodily autonomy” when you have, more or less, said that nerdy incelbros should be given sex slaves by the government.
Before you protest about me putting words in my mouth, let me draw your attention to this remarkable post: https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3766. Let’s remember the context here. This was shortly after a deranged psycopath ran over a dozen people in Toronto with his truck. Rather than condemning this terrorist, you instead posted a link to an article by Robin Hanson, a despicable alt-right libertaribro, who, more or less, said that to placate such violent young men, the government should enshrine a “right to sex,” which, let’s be real, means to give them a sex slave. Rather than condemning this disgusting argument, you actually entertained it! Rather than telling nerdy guys to stop being stinky and awkward and learn some social skills, you reinforced their prejudices and more or less told them that they have a right to sex, while only giving the minimal token support for women’s autonomy.
Let’s be clear. Nobody has a “right to sex.” Nerdbro incel culture is founded on the idea that they have a right to women’s bodies. By entertaining this disgusting idea, you are entirely undermining your claim to care about reproductive rights. Because why should I believe ypu when you say you support a woman’s right to choose,a woman’s right to control her own body, when you think stinky, awkward, nerdy young guys with no social skills should have a girlfriend mailed to them by the state?
It’s clear that, in fact, you don’t care about women’s bodily autonomy Scott. Because there is a direct and inescapable logical contradiction, between bodily autonomy, and thinking you’re “owed” sex, somehow, just for existing and being a male. To whatever degree you do support abortion, it’s not because you care about women, but because you care about “the enlightenment,” which is just a dogwhistle for white supremacist capitalism. You said it yourself just now 🤣
Feminist Bitch #50: My main response to you is in my new post, but I should briefly add: you’ve lied and slandered me here, and anyone who doubts that simply needs to read the old post of mine that you yourself linked to. They’ll see that, not only did I not defend the absurd and risible concept of a “right to sex,” as you falsely claimed, but I condemned it the most emphatic language I possess. (The very title of the post, “Zeroth Commandment,” referred to my attempt to codify my condemnation, to enshrine female bodily autonomy as an ur-principle.)
What I have advocated, it’s true, is compassion and understanding (as opposed to the sneering contempt that drips from your comments above) for the many nerdy heterosexual males who suffer from crippling insecurity around dating. I’ve tried again and again to explain that, while many of these guys might’ve been considered good or even great catches for most of human history, they tend to struggle in a modern, unstructured dating environment where a genuine inability to read social cues is easily misconstrued as creepiness or harassment. And the more scrupulously moral they are, the worse that problem is. And so, hoping to make a positive difference for all concerned, I spent months of my life hashing out the complicated questions around nerdiness and dating with straight women, male feminists, gays and lesbians and trans folks. And I actually think we all came to understand each other a lot better—at least, those of us who showed up to share and learn rather than tweet and condemn. I plead guilty to all of this.
Don’t feed the trolls, Scott. Judging from their absurdly over-the-top writing and mischaracterization of others’ position, “Feminist Bitch” could well be some extreme-right (and/or Russian) provocateur who’s just out to sow division.
“by my reckoning, you have made THREE TIMES the number of posts about the “rights” of nerdy incels and how sad it is that they can’t get sex, versus posts supporting women’s bodily autonomy and basic reproductive freedoms.
But Scott is a nerd, so, of course he’ll be posting *more* about what he knows best, i.e. the condition of being a nerd, rather than posting about what he knows less: what it’s like to be a woman, or the downsides of being a super famous movie star, or what it’s like to be a quadriplegic, or what its like to be living with stage 4 cancer, or what it’s like to be a Taliban in the 21st century.
Just like, as a woman, you’re here posting about women’s rights rather than posting about nerds’ rights on some feminist blog.
Tolerance goes both ways, you can’t just bully everyone on the planet to realize that your point of view is the most important one while simultaneously putting everyone else down for being different than you.
> “no-signaling” indicates that you need more than just a wave function and Schrödinger’s equation. You also need space (or space-time)
Space is massive overkill, I think. All you need is the postulate that systems are combined using the tensor product. Locality is then the property that operations on system A commute with operations on system B. I guess there’s then also an implicit assumption that specific systems (like a quantum computer and the rest of the universe) fit into this schema where they factor into a tensor product.
Oh right, space is indeed overkill. I made that mistake again to assume that spacelike separation would be the only way to get no-signaling (independence) between two system. (Last time I started with “timelike q-correlations could be problematic,” then backed-down to “there is one difference between timelike correlations and spacelike correlations” on realizing my mistake, and the next time I brought up the topic, I wrote instead “only those correlations between observables whose (anti-)commutator nearly vanishes”.)
On the other hand, some MWI proponents seemed to be more comfortable with suggesting that some connection between space-time and a preferred basis should be assumed, than to be specific that they mean “the tensor product” when they talk of “factor states”.
> What should be wrong with the Copenhagen interpretation for a quantum computer in the first place?
I wasn’t claiming that collapse interpretations would fail to describe quantum computers. I was trying to turn the fuzzy problem of “why do I think the probability is X” into the concrete problem of “what does this computer program store in this register”. I was trying to do so without invoking collapse, but that’s different from saying collapse wouldn’t give the right answer!
Your strategy to analyse quantum puzzles and paradoxes by translating them into the language of (circuit based) quantum computers indeed often works extremely well. But for many-worlds, one of the motivations is that the strategy of Copenhagen to base the ontology on classical measurement devices is dubious, as it the strategy of De-Broglie Bohm to base the ontology on partical positions. But for a quantum computer, it is absolutely correct to base the ontology on the individual qubits and their no-signaling independence.
(Resubmitting this comment after it vanished during moderation yesterday; assuming that was an oversight confusion with my subsequent comment that went through, since I can’t see how this is an outrageous or off-topic comment. I’m actually asking a real question here, and would appreciate answers)
Here’s the thing about objections to MWI that I don’t understand. Yes, I understand that once branches fully decohere, we can’t (if QM is ultimately truly linear) observe other branches of the wave function, and then all the metaphysical questions about falsifiability and whether it matters become valid concerns.
But we CAN observe things that look like “short branches” of the wave function, that recohere just before they fully decohere. That’s what “Wigner’s friend” is all about: we can kind of see from outside how an observer enters the superposition through entanglement, and then how as entanglement diffuses into the rest of the universe, larger and larger regions enter that superposition. To me, all MWI says is that this process doesn’t somehow end once decoherence has progressed past the complexity level where we can’t feasibly do the work to recohere it. But that is not some kind of magic boundary, and we can see the branches all the way up until it just becomes infeasible to recohere them.
Decoherence as a process, as far as I can tell, is not really debateable anymore- it is a clear and mathematically sound consequence of how increasing entanglement complexity propagates in a complex world. By itself, it seems that decoherence as a process that exists, MUST produce something that looks like wave function branching. One may argue about whether the branching continues forever, but the miniature, abortive branches that seem to form in something like Wigner’s friend (or, as far as current experimental procedure has progressed, on a smaller scale with inanimate objects where we can feasibly force the branches to interfere and thus recohere) can’t really be dismissed. Decoherence MUST produce something that looks locally like collapse; that’s just the way the math works.
So, the question I have always wanted to put to those who believe in objective collapse theories is this: if at least the beginnings of abortive branches can be observed in smaller scale experiments, through incomplete decoherence, then when the additional objective collapse postulate is added for rare, true collapse events, we really seem to have TWO kinds of collapse going on, even if one of them is temporary: decoherent collapse, which on a small scale must be acknowledged, even if the ultimate irreversible decoherence is never reached, and the added objective collapse. So, do objective collapse believers acknowledge that decoherence produces something that looks locally like collapse, or not? Even if they don’t believe in the permanent and unobservable MWI branches, it seems to me they must acknowledge at least the beginnings of that process, before complexity removes our ability to recohere.
There are really two questions: whether decoherence as a natural part of how Schrodinger’s equation evolves occurs and looks locally like “temporary” collapse, and then the further question of whether that process continues past the point where we can feasibly create interference between the “roots” of the branches, and produces the unobservable larger branches that the MWI argues for. Why can’t everyone at least agree that decoherence produces something that looks like local, abortive collapse? And if so, why is it not obvious that the boundary between that and unobservable branching is simply a matter of complexity theory: is recoherence feasible or not?
As far as I know, objective collapse theories usually don’t eliminate unobservable branching anyway; there’s still a regime (in terms of length, time, and mass scales) where objective collapse occurs too slowly to stop the branches from forming, but the behavior is classical anyway, so the other branches must be unobservable. So, there really isn’t any connection between observability of superpositions and their tending to undergo objective collapse.
I think that my position is that something sort of close to 2, but with some modifications/additions is a satisfying answer:
I think that the ‘swap’ of Shion into Fred, or vice versa, is in fact a no-op, in the same way that talking about magically swapping two individual electrons somewhere is a no-op, because There’s nothing ‘there’ to swap. I.e. if the swap will produce an identical configuration, it’s a no-op. As Eliezer Yudkowsky says in his series of posts that have been referred to above, there’s no such thing as “this electron here, that electron there”, only “an electron here, an electron there”. Likewise, we have “a Shion here, a Fred there.” I don’t think there really is something like a ‘universal conscousness’, in the sense that consciousness is an emergent property that applies to certain types of patterns in the quantum field (for example human brains). Other parts of the universe’s quantum field, for example the vast majority of it that consists of mostly empty space, are pretty clearly not conscious.
How this relates to the ‘why am I me’ thing, this model will predict that the part of the universe that can be considered Shion will have the relevant experience of “I am Shion” and the part that we call Fred will have the relevant experience of “I am Fred”. I’m trying really hard to do more than just restate my previous point here, but it seems like this model doesn’t really leave a dangling mystery about identity.
As for “Why are Shion and Fred conscious”, I actually think that this is in fact a very hard problem, that might take humanity a long while to find a satisfying answer for.
Scott, as a far-left mathematician (how far-left? think German Antifa), I just wanted to say that:
1. While we probably disagree on most political matters, I completely support you when it comes to your analysis of the pain that so many lonely and harmless nerds experience.
2. Wokeism is a mostly an American phenomenon, and although it has hijacked a large part of the American left, I believe that wokeism is more of a cultural and psychological phenomenon than a genuine political movement. It often involves a grotesque display of narcissism in the disguise of identity politics, which I guess is a natural outcome of social media rewiring people’s brains and social norms. I guess that the point here is that in order to explain the behavior of Feminist Bitch and other internet wokes, you should refer to Freud rather than Marx, and you should refer to Netflix rather than to a coherent statement a la the Communist Manifesto. The bottom line of this is that wokeism has very little to do with leftism. While in North America the two terms are commonly perceived as overlapping, this is not the case in Europe and other parts of the world. So please, please, stop mentioning ‘woke’ and ‘left’ next to each other as if it’s the same entity.
“How this relates to the ‘why am I me’ thing, this model will predict that the part of the universe that can be considered Shion will have the relevant experience of “I am Shion” and the part that we call Fred will have the relevant experience of “I am Fred”. I’m trying really hard to do more than just restate my previous point here, but it seems like this model doesn’t really leave a dangling mystery about identity.”
In his book “my view of the world”, Schrodinger brings this up in a different way, which I’m trying to restate here (with some modifications):
Imagine two individuals, A and B.
In situation 1), A is sitting outside on a chair in the sun, looking at a tree, while B is sitting in the basement, in the dark.
In situation 2), B is the one sitting outside on a chair in the sun, looking at the tree, while A is sitting in the dark in the basement.
From the point of view of the physical universe, the two situations are very similar, i.e. the difference in the material/physical description world between those two situations is a function of the difference between the brains of A and B, which can be made arbitrarily small in theory.
But there exists another point of view, namely A’s subjective experience, where those situations are totally different, totally asymmetric, no matter how similar A and B are: In situation 1) A is seeing a tree, in situation 2), A is seeing darkness (and this isn’t depending on B’s point of view).
So, when you say “a part of the universe will have A’s experience”, we just don’t have any physical description/law encapsulating this, e.g. from the point of view of physics, the wave functions of the universe (or the quantum fields) in those two situations can be made arbitrarily indistinguishable (it’s like an extension of swapping two electrons, but, unlike brains, electrons don’t have subjective experience… or maybe they do?).
According to Schrodinger, this break of symmetry is the hard problem of consciousness: a description of the universe in terms of matter (particles) will never capture this asymmetry, it will never capture subjective experience.
He was apparently into Vedanta Hindu philosophy, so his answer to this problem was a sort of universal consciousness.
#P in FBQP #61: I’d follow the protocol that’s worked in every single one of the dozens of previous such cases. Namely, just calm down and wait for the bug to be found. In this case, the fact that the author can’t decide whether he wants to explicitly claim P#P=BQP or not claim it is far from reassuring.
“While in North America the two terms are commonly perceived as overlapping, this is not the case in Europe and other parts of the world.”
Wokeness has already been a big characteristic of the french far-left for many years now, with American woke-ism being of course a huge inspiration (e.g. the political rise of people like AOC has been noticed immediately, she’s a role model now).
It’s not surprising since today’s world is so connected. The George Floyd movement (with effects like tearing down statues and defunding the police) spread to the entire world in no time.
I’m interested what you think of this thought experiment where I imagine running a quantum counting algorithm on a simulation of a conscious human, to find out for how many inputs it produces an output with a given property.
To me, the most noteworthy thing about the argument is that the “wavefunction collapse” here is caused by the consciousnesses observing their respective inputs. The simulation may include simulated decoherence, but this would just be an implementation detail; so we should not attribute the collapse to it.
The world was going along very nicely for billions of years before people invented symbols to try to represent what was happening. The world is not so much a mathematical system, as a system where mathematical symbols are useful to represent relationships, categories (like mass, position, or light wavelength), and things described as “numbers”, that seem to exist in the world. To claim that the world IS a mathematical system is a step too far.
Seemingly, most of the mathematical models of physics don’t take seriously a world where Putin’s troops are killing people and destroying cities. According to these models, what Putin is doing is just another neutral outcome that occurs, an outcome that is not essentially different to any other outcome that occurs, because all outcomes are just the system evolving in a normal way.
Seemingly, only Chris Fuchs’ model can come close to taking seriously a world where Putin’s troops are killing people and destroying cities. This is because Fuchs doesn’t attempt to describe a mind-independent reality. In his arXiv paper “Notwithstanding Bohr, the Reasons for QBism”, Fuchs quotes physicist John Wheeler, who said:
“A lovely way to put it – ‘Is the big bang here?’ I can imagine that we will someday have to answer your question with a ‘yes.’ . . . Each elementary quantum phenomenon is an elementary act of ‘fact creation.’ That is incontestable. But is that the only mechanism needed to create all that is? Is what took place at the big bang the consequence of billions upon billions of these elementary processes, these elementary ‘acts of observer-participancy,’ these quantum phenomena? Have we had the mechanism of creation before our eyes all this time without recognizing the truth? That is the larger question implicit in your comment. Of all the deep questions of our time, I do not know one that is deeper, more exciting, more clearly pregnant with a great advance in our understanding.”
I think life as a physical system completes a triangle of weird puzzles, the other two being the very large scale and the very small scale behaviors of matter. We have strong theories for each of these behaviors, though it is hard to imagine that any of them is a complete story. For life the obvious question is: why does matter arrange itself in this out of equilibrium self reproducing very large (relative to elementary particles) structure? Is that related to gravity, beyond the obvious fact that gravity creates chemical complexity necessary for life? Is it related to QM, beyond the obvious fact that life relies on QM in its underlying molecular interactions? Or is life just another intriguing fact about our universe?
#P in FBQP #69: To say it one more time, the paper itself uses weasel language when it gets to the crucial point:
The existence of such a multiplicative error quantum algorithm for matrix permanent would lead to the surprising conclusion that BQP would equal P#P because we know BQP ⊆ P#P [53, 54]. Here, we do not definitively claim that BQP = P#P; further computational complexity analysis is required with our quantum algorithm for the conclusion. The bottom line is that the constant factor estimation of the real parts of the overlap integrals will lead us to the constant factor estimation of matrix permanents. We note here that the constant factor algorithm assumes the ideal quantum device, and only the statistical error was considered in the analysis.
If the author himself doesn’t entirely trust his proof, then can you blame me for not trusting it either? 🙂
In slightly more detail, the part I don’t believe is that the multiplicative error estimation will still work if the amplitude is exponentially small. And I don’t see any hint of an adequate argument that it still works in that case, and the author himself seems to admit that he lacks an adequate argument. But this is also the only part that matters if you want to do #P.
Usually things like this show up on reddit. But nothing happened this time. Brilliant insight on “the multiplicative error estimation will still work if the amplitude is exponentially small”. Also the author is a Chemistry Prof.

Last week, Takashi Yamakawa and Mark Zhandry posted a preprint to the arXiv, “Verifiable Quantum Advantage without Structure,” that represents some of the most exciting progress in quantum complexity theory in years. I wish I’d thought of it. tl;dr they show that relative to a random oracle (!), there’s an NP search problem that quantum computers can solve exponentially faster than classical ones. And yet this is 100% consistent with the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture!
A student brought my attention to Quantle, a variant of Wordle where you need to guess a true equation involving 1-qubit quantum states and unitary transformations. It’s really well-done! Possibly the best quantum game I’ve seen.
Last month, Microsoft announced on the web that it had achieved an experimental breakthrough in topological quantum computing: not quite the creation of a topological qubit, but some of the underlying physics required for that. This followed their needing to retract their previous claim of such a breakthrough, due to the criticisms of Sergey Frolov and others. One imagines that they would’ve taken far greater care this time around. Unfortunately, a research paper doesn’t seem to be available yet. Anyone with further details is welcome to chime in.
Woohoo! Maximum flow, maximum bipartite matching, matrix scaling, and isotonic regression on posets (among many others)—all algorithmic problems that I was familiar with way back in the 1990s—are now solvable in nearly-linear time, thanks to a breakthrough by Chen et al.!

25,6244,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6244,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2022-01-25,Scott Aaronson,Why Quantum Mechanics?,"In the past few months, I’ve twice injured the same ankle while playing with my kids. This, perhaps combined with covid, led me to several indisputable realizations:
- I am mortal.
- Despite my self-conception as a nerdy little kid awaiting the serious people’s approval, I am now firmly middle-aged. By my age, Einstein had completed general relativity, Turing had founded CS, won WWII, and proposed the Turing Test, and Galois, Ramanujan, and Ramsey had been dead for years.
- Thus, whatever I wanted to accomplish in my intellectual life, I should probably get started on it now.
Hence today’s post. I’m feeling a strong compulsion to write an essay, or possibly even a book, surveying and critically evaluating a century of ideas about the following question:
Q: Why should the universe have been quantum-mechanical?
If you want, you can divide Q into two subquestions:
Q1: Why didn’t God just make the universe classical and be done with it? What would’ve been wrong with that choice?
Q2: Assuming classical physics wasn’t good enough for whatever reason, why this specific alternative? Why the complex-valued amplitudes? Why unitary transformations? Why the Born rule? Why the tensor product?
Despite its greater specificity, Q2 is ironically the question that I feel we have a better handle on. I could spend half a semester teaching theorems that admittedly don’t answer Q2, as satisfyingly as Einstein answered the question “why the Lorentz transformations?,” but that at least render this particular set of mathematical choices (the 2-norm, the Born Rule, complex numbers, etc.) orders-of-magnitude less surprising than one might’ve thought they were a priori. Q1 therefore stands, to me at least, as the more mysterious of the two questions.
So, I want to write something about the space of credible answers to Q, and especially Q1, that humans can currently conceive. I want to do this for my own sake as much as for others’. I want to do it because I regard Q as one of the biggest questions ever asked, for which it seems plausible to me that there’s simply an answer that most experts would accept as valid once they saw it, but for which no such answer is known. And also because, besides having spent 25 years working in quantum information, I have the following qualifications for the job:
- I don’t dismiss either Q1 or Q2 as silly; and
- crucially, I don’t think I already know the answers, and merely need better arguments to justify them. I’m genuinely uncertain and confused.
The purpose of this post is to invite you to share your own answers to Q in the comments section. Before I embark on my survey project, I’d better know if there are promising ideas that I’ve missed, and this blog seems like as good a place as any to crowdsource the job.
Any answer is welcome, no matter how wild or speculative, so long as it honestly grapples with the actual nature of QM. To illustrate, nothing along the lines of “the universe is quantum because it needs to be holistic, interconnected, full of surprises, etc. etc.” will cut it, since such answers leave utterly unexplained why the world wasn’t simply endowed with those properties directly, rather than specifically via generalizing the rules of probability to allow interference and noncommuting observables.
Relatedly, whatever “design goal” you propose for the laws of physics, if the goal is satisfied by QM, but satisfied even better by theories that provide even more power than QM does—for instance, superluminal signalling, or violations of Tsirelson’s bound, or the efficient solution of NP-complete problems—then your explanation is out. This is a remarkably strong constraint.
Oh, needless to say, don’t try my patience with anything about the uncertainty principle being due to floating-point errors or rendering bugs, or anything else that relies on a travesty of QM lifted from a popular article or meme! 🙂
OK, maybe four more comments to enable a more productive discussion, before I shut up and turn things over to you:
- I’m aware, of course, of the radical uncertainty about what form an answer to Q should even take. Am I asking you to psychoanalyze the will of God in creating the universe? Or, what perhaps amounts to the same thing, am I asking for the design objectives of the giant computer simulation that we’re living in? (As in, “I’m 100% fine with living inside a Matrix … I just want to understand why it’s a unitary matrix!”) Am I instead asking for an anthropic explanation, showing why of course QM would be needed if you wanted life or consciousness like ours? Am I “merely” asking for simpler or more intuitive physical principles from which QM is to be derived as a consequence? Am I asking why QM is the “most elegant choice” in some space of mathematical options … even to the point where, with hindsight, a 19th-century mathematician or physicist could’ve been convinced that of course this must be part of Nature’s plan? Am I asking for something else entirely? You get to decide! Should you take up my challenge, this is both your privilege and your terrifying burden.
- I’m aware, of course, of the dizzying array of central physical phenomena that rely on QM for their ultimate explanation. These phenomena range from the stability of matter itself, which depends on the Pauli exclusion principle; to the nuclear fusion that powers the sun, which depends on a quantum tunneling effect; to the discrete energy levels of electrons (and hence, the combinatorial nature of chemistry), which relies on electrons being waves of probability amplitude that can only circle nuclei an integer number of times if their crests are to meet their troughs. Important as they are, though, I don’t regard any of these phenomena as satisfying answers to Q in themselves. The reason is simply that, in each case, it would seem like child’s-play to contrive some classical mechanism to produce the same effect, were that the goal. QM just seems far too grand to have been the answer to these questions! An exponentially larger state space for all of reality, plus the end of Newtonian determinism, just to overcome the technical problem that accelerating charges radiate energy in classical electrodynamics, thereby rendering atoms unstable? It reminds me of the Simpsons episode where Homer uses a teleportation machine to get a beer from the fridge without needing to get up off the couch.
- I’m aware of Gleason’s theorem, and of the specialness of the 1-norm and 2-norm in linear algebra, and of the arguments for complex amplitudes as opposed to reals or quaternions, and of the beautiful work of Lucien Hardy and of Chiribella et al. and others on axiomatic derivations of quantum theory. As some of you might remember, I even discussed much of this material in Quantum Computing Since Democritus! There’s a huge amount to say about these fascinating justifications for the rules of QM, and I hope to say some of it in my planned survey! For now, I’ll simply remark that every axiomatic reconstruction of QM that I’ve seen, impressive though it was, has relied on one or more axioms that struck me as weird, in the sense that I’d have little trouble dismissing the axioms as totally implausible and unmotivated if I hadn’t already known (from QM, of course) that they were true. The axiomatic reconstructions do help me somewhat with Q2, but little if at all with Q1.
- To keep the discussion focused, in this post I’d like to exclude answers along the lines of “but what if QM is merely an approximation to something else?,” to say nothing of “a century of evidence for QM was all just a massive illusion! LOCAL HIDDEN VARIABLES FOR THE WIN!!!” We can have those debates another day—God knows that, here on Shtetl-Optimized, we have and we will. Here I’m asking instead: imagine that, as fantastical as it sounds, QM were not only exactly true, but (along with relativity, thermodynamics, evolution, and the tastiness of chocolate) one of the profoundest truths our sorry species had ever discovered. Why should I have expected that truth all along? What possible reasons to expect it have I missed?",8099,"['407d93e1f67c879e3b64e05cbf2e9e4636c8b694cb9f35e3160ec080c08240ba', '76fb7d759adf48e5cabb8608a5dfc3e60f4a6f051c4f906cafc01afe9caf8f77',

I waste a large fraction of my existence just reading about what’s happening in the world, or discussion and analysis thereof, in an unending scroll of paralysis and depression. On the first anniversary of the January 6 attack, I read the recent revelations about just how close the seditionists actually came to overturning the election outcome (e.g., by pressuring just one Republican state legislature to “decertify” its electors, after which the others would likely follow in a domino effect), and how hard it now is to see a path by which democracy in the United States will survive beyond 2024. Or I read about Joe Manchin, who’s already entered the annals of history as the man who could’ve halted the slide to the abyss and decided not to. Of course, I also read about the wokeists, who correctly see the swing of civilization getting pushed terrifyingly far out of equilibrium to the right, so their solution is to push the swing terrifyingly far out of equilibrium to the left, and then they act shocked when their own action, having added all this potential energy to the swing, causes it to swing back even further to the right, as swings tend to do. (And also there’s a global pandemic killing millions, and the correct response to it—to authorize and distribute new vaccines as quickly as the virus mutates—is completely outside the Overton Window between Obey the Experts and Disobey the Experts, advocated by no one but a few nerds. When I first wrote this post, I forgot all about the global pandemic.) And I see all this and I am powerless to stop it.
In such a dark time, it’s easy to forget that I’m a theoretical computer scientist, mainly focused on quantum computing. It’s easy to forget that people come to this blog because they want to read about quantum computing. It’s like, who gives a crap about that anymore? What doth it profit a man, if he gaineth a few thousand fault-tolerant qubits with which to calculateth chemical reaction rates or discrete logarithms, and he loseth civilization?
Nevertheless, in the rest of this post I’m going to share some quantum-related debunking updates—not because that’s what’s at the top of my mind, but in an attempt to find my way back to sanity. Picture that: quantum mechanics (and specifically, the refutation of outlandish claims related to quantum mechanics) as the part of one’s life that’s comforting, normal, and sane.
There’s been lots of online debate about the claim to have entangled a tardigrade (i.e., water bear) with a superconducting qubit; see also this paper by Vlatko Vedral, this from CNET, this from Ben Brubaker on Twitter. So, do we now have Schrödinger’s Tardigrade: a living, “macroscopic” organism maintained coherently in a quantum superposition of two states? How could such a thing be possible with the technology of the early 21st century? Hasn’t it been a huge challenge to demonstrate even Schrödinger’s Virus or Schrödinger’s Bacterium? So then how did this experiment leapfrog (or leaptardigrade) over those vastly easier goals?
Short answer: it didn’t. The experimenters couldn’t directly measure the degree of freedom in the tardigrade that’s claimed to be entangled with the qubit. But it’s consistent with everything they report that whatever entanglement is there, it’s between the superconducting qubit and a microscopic part of the tardigrade. It’s also consistent with everything they report that there’s no entanglement at all between the qubit and any part of the tardigrade, just boring classical correlation. (Or rather that, if there’s “entanglement,” then it’s the Everett kind, involving not merely the qubit and the tardigrade but the whole environment—the same as we’d get by just measuring the qubit!) Further work would be needed to distinguish these possibilities. In any case, it’s of course cool that they were able to cool a tardigrade to near absolute zero and then revive it afterwards.
I thank the authors of the tardigrade paper, who clarified a few of these points in correspondence with me. Obviously the comments section is open for whatever I’ve misunderstood.
People also asked me to respond to Sabine Hossenfelder’s recent video about superdeterminism, a theory that holds that quantum entanglement doesn’t actually exist, but the universe’s initial conditions were fine-tuned to stop us from choosing to measure qubits in ways that would make its nonexistence apparent: even when we think we’re applying the right measurements, we’re not, because the initial conditions messed with our brains or our computers’ random number generators. (See, I tried to be as non-prejudicial as possible in that summary, and it still came out sounding like a parody. Sorry!)
Sabine sets up the usual dichotomy that people argue against superdeterminism only because they’re attached to a belief in free will. She rejects Bell’s statistical independence assumption, which she sees as a mere dogma rather than a prerequisite for doing science. Toward the end of the video, Sabine mentions the objection that, without statistical independence, a demon could destroy any randomized controlled trial, by tampering with the random number generator that decides who’s in the control group and who isn’t. But she then reassures the viewer that it’s no problem: superdeterministic conspiracies will only appear when quantum mechanics would’ve predicted a Bell inequality violation or the like. Crucially, she never explains the mechanism by which superdeterminism, once allowed into the universe (including into macroscopic devices like computers and random number generators), will stay confined to reproducing the specific predictions that quantum mechanics already told us were true, rather than enabling ESP or telepathy or other mischief. This is stipulated, never explained or derived.
To say I’m not a fan of superdeterminism would be a super-understatement. And yet, nothing I’ve written previously on this blog—about superdeterminism’s gobsmacking lack of explanatory power, or about how trivial it would be to cook up a superdeterministic “mechanism” for, e.g., faster-than-light signaling—none of it seems to have made a dent. It’s all come across as obvious to the majority of physicists and computer scientists who think as I do, and it’s all fallen on deaf ears to superdeterminism’s fans.
So in desperation, let me now try another tack: going meta. It strikes me that no one who saw quantum mechanics as a profound clue about the nature of reality could ever, in a trillion years, think that superdeterminism looked like a promising route forward given our current knowledge. The only way you could think that, it seems to me, is if you saw quantum mechanics as an anti-clue: a red herring, actively misleading us about how the world really is. To be a superdeterminist is to say:
OK, fine, there’s the Bell experiment, which looks like Nature screaming the reality of ‘genuine indeterminism, as predicted by QM,’ louder than you might’ve thought it even logically possible for that to be screamed. But don’t listen to Nature, listen to us! If you just drop what you thought were foundational assumptions of science, we can explain this away! Not explain it, of course, but explain it away. What more could you ask from us?
Here’s my challenge to the superdeterminists: when, in 400 years from Galileo to the present, has such a gambit ever worked? Maxwell’s equations were a clue to special relativity. The Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of classical mechanics were clues to quantum mechanics. When has a great theory in physics ever been grudgingly accommodated by its successor theory in a horrifyingly ad-hoc way, rather than gloriously explained and derived?
Update: Oh right, and the QIP’2022 list of accepted talks is out! And I was on the program committee! And
they’re still planning to hold QIP in person, in March at Caltech, will you fancy that! actually I have no idea—but if they’re going to move to virtual, I’m awaiting an announcement just like everyone

- An interview with me in Communications of the ACM, mostly about BosonSampling and the quantum lower bound for the collision problem.
Enjoy y’all!

28,6129,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6129,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-11-19,Scott Aaronson,The Acrobatics of BQP,"Abstract: We show that, in the black-box setting, the behavior of quantum polynomial-time (BQP) can be remarkably decoupled from that of classical complexity classes like NP. Specifically:
– There exists an oracle relative to which NPBQP⊄BQPPH, resolving a 2005 problem of Fortnow. Interpreted another way, we show that AC0 circuits cannot perform useful homomorphic encryption on instances of the Forrelation problem. As a corollary, there exists an oracle relative to which P=NP but BQP≠QCMA.
– Conversely, there exists an oracle relative to which BQPNP⊄PHBQP.
– Relative to a random oracle, PP=PostBQP is not contained in the “QMA hierarchy” QMAQMA^QMA^…, and more generally PP⊄(MIP*)(MIP*)^(MIP*)^… (!), despite the fact that MIP*=RE in the unrelativized world. This result shows that there is no black-box quantum analogue of Stockmeyer’s approximate counting algorithm.
– Relative to a random oracle, Σk+1⊄BQPΣ_k for every k.
– There exists an oracle relative to which BQP=P#P and yet PH is infinite. (By contrast, if NP⊆BPP, then PH collapses relative to all oracles.)
– There exists an oracle relative to which P=NP≠BQP=P#P.
To achieve these results, we build on the 2018 achievement by Raz and Tal of an oracle relative to which BQP⊄PH, and associated results about the Forrelation problem. We also introduce new tools that might be of independent interest. These include a “quantum-aware” version of the random restriction method, a concentration theorem for the block sensitivity of AC0 circuits, and a (provable) analogue of the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture for sparse oracles.

29,6111,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6111,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-11-16,Scott Aaronson,"Scott Aaronson, when reached for comment, said…","About IBM’s new 127-qubit superconducting chip: As I told New Scientist, I look forward to seeing the actual details! As far as I could see, the marketing materials that IBM released yesterday take a lot of words to say absolutely nothing about what, to experts, is the single most important piece of information: namely, what are the gate fidelities? How deep of a quantum circuit can they apply? How have they benchmarked the chip? Right now, all I have to go on is a stats page for the new chip,
which reports its average CNOT error as 0.9388—in other words, close to 1, or terrible! (But see also a tweet by James Wootton, which explains that such numbers are often highly misleading when a new chip is first rolled out.) Does anyone here have more information? Update (11/17): As of this morning, the average CNOT error has been updated to 2%. Thanks to multiple commenters for letting me know!
About the new simulation of Google’s 53-qubit Sycamore chip in 5 minutes on a Sunway supercomputer (see also here): This is an exciting step forward on the classical validation of quantum supremacy experiments, and—ironically, what currently amounts to almost the same thing—on the classical spoofing of those experiments. Congratulations to the team in China that achieved this! But there are two crucial things to understand. First, “5 minutes” refers to the time needed to calculate a single amplitude (or perhaps, several correlated amplitudes) using tensor network contraction. It doesn’t refer to the time needed to generate millions of independent noisy samples, which is what Google’s Sycamore chip does in 3 minutes. For the latter task, more like a week still seems to be needed on the supercomputer. (I’m grateful to Chu Guo, a coauthor of the new work who spoke in UT Austin’s weekly quantum Zoom meeting, for clarifying this point.) Second, the Sunway supercomputer has parallel processing power equivalent to approximately ten million of your laptop. Thus, even if we agreed that Google no longer had quantum supremacy as measured by time, it would still have quantum supremacy as measured by carbon footprint! (And this despite the fact that the quantum computer itself requires a noisy, closet-sized dilution fridge.) Even so, for me the new work underscores the point that quantum supremacy is not yet a done deal. Over the next few years, I hope that Google and USTC, as well as any new entrants to this race (IBM? IonQ? Harvard? Rigetti?), will push forward with more qubits and, even more importantly, better gate fidelities leading to higher Linear Cross-Entropy scores. Meanwhile, we theorists should try to do our part by inventing new and better protocols with which to demonstrate near-term quantum supremacy—especially protocols for which the classical verification is easier.
About the new anti-woke University of Austin (UATX): In general, I’m extremely happy for people to experiment with new and different institutions, and of course I’m happy for more intellectual activity in my adopted city of Austin. And, as Shtetl-Optimized readers will know, I’m probably more sympathetic than most to the reality of the problem that UATX is trying to solve—living, as we do, in an era when one academic after another has been cancelled for ideas that a mere decade ago would’ve been considered unexceptional, moderate, center-left. Having said all that, I wish I could feel more optimistic about UATX’s prospects. I found its website heavy on free-speech rhetoric but frustratingly light on what the new university is actually going to do: what courses it will offer, who will teach them, where the campus will be, etc. etc. Arguably this is all excusable for a university still in ramp-up mode, but had I been in their shoes, I might have held off on the public launch until I had at least some sample content to offer. Certainly, the fact that Steven Pinker has quit UATX’s advisory board is a discouraging sign. If UATX asks me to get involved—to lecture there, to give them advice about their CS program, etc.—I’ll consider it as I would any other request. So far, though, they haven’t.
About the Association for Mathematical Research: Last month, some colleagues invited me to join a brand-new society called the Association for Mathematical Research. Many of the other founders (Joel Hass, Abigail Thompson, Colin Adams, Richard Borcherds, Jeff Cheeger, Pavel Etingof, Tom Hales, Jeff Lagarias, Mark Lackenby, Cliff Taubes, …) were brilliant mathematicians who I admired, they seemed like they could use a bit of theoretical computer science representation, there was no time commitment, maybe they’d eventually do something good, so I figured why not? Alas, to say that AMR has proved unpopular on Twitter would be an understatement: it’s received the same contemptuous reception that UATX has. The argument seems to be: starting a new mathematical society, even an avowedly diverse and apolitical one, is really just an implicit claim that the existing societies, like the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) and the American Mathematical Society (AMS), have been co-opted by woke true-believers. But that’s paranoid and insane! I mean, it’s not as if an AMS blog has called for the mass resignation of white male mathematicians to make room for the marginalized, or the boycott of Israeli universities, or the abolition of the criminal justice system (what to do about Kyle Rittenhouse though?). Still, even though claims of that sort of co-option are obviously far-out, rabid fantasies, yeah, I did decide to give a new organization the benefit of the doubt. AMR might well fail or languish in obscurity, just like UATX might. On the other hand, the barriers to making a positive difference for the intellectual world, the world I love, the world under constant threat from the self-certain ideologues of every side, do strike me as orders of magnitude smaller for a new professional society than they do for a new university.",5963,"['dea3e029f885a05bc1e4a763cc301be19e683a560074b6797d2ab0df5996cfb9', '25c8b7be34295a4e6a781a61f7ad38ada1ea0af51a2e23b3ba8c354ebb2a45ac', '4b680a077df2cf4ccf3bc00c4d5d209a074745886d810aed73cb9a62f50ad708', 'e59233eb6f9439f0855087704bfec5e025e4dcefb4c58431e5af2b3067d87525', '7d194a00cfb1ad895e28a223349da2a9d5fa0edcd5f3026c486f854659746779', '7d675c744047757b6b0b4e9db50d852faec35ad223825813085257cd2d0105af', 'c8e890b4e944bc9f332186fbb6f3de0699ac5aa361c92422c50c0aca9221d563', '913c9fd3741d0a1d79c1a9fa792ebf881ff6d29dc4daa19f8e425d9137e2b0ac', '051718de3f8df09663da897d5741cb9e4eca522f4aad3debe9c9f8cf53db31aa', '9aaaa1dbd67d710a3e9e79f60c48e10af32a4ec3f55165a59cd22dcf2048f584', 'a0a2c0ecc30f917d945c877f4ec8e052af3059fcdfb73f3fc50992f26f7ffda3', '3e4e818aa78935a2abb1bbbc973e3862244c2e371f4a5e217c3d205ebb042db8', 'be803f6dec24ad8af08570cdde0e4323e0b81b09366bb8a9b7facc51d0709776', 'daeaf4b058d803cc42586d2020bf5c91fb28294fa1ae70b702c21e17302cb8f2', 'aac71d4883f822f4a54e80d16a62b115ace3dc4fc652785a0c18192ca577cd6d', 'dae70512ca04d4072c12733653718ed8d2989d2ec1f851d7fbaa95a86e4efa90', 'e7421e4f02a7a1f2dc14565106a702c8e94803b334ee0b3ae17202c61d6d3608', 'fa34b03e5432be75353937e3e87086a1a30d16b5ac2d921e6fa7f9a189c2d1a0', '6981bd7e95c6cc14aebf00b2a8eb17639522e4b5bad06bf84a312219f2cfd16f', '892b959dbb1ac2f1cb86b9c61939956beeec4a039d3be037f8e6c650b1d116fb', '2ec19303ad7f871e3570471dad424fbebf9061a2a6cd4870df0fd6743faf552f', '25cea8dc7f045df59734f769f73b9e78858275dcb68e102dec1e21e4186bd1b0', '4e8f8283bb5b91882f0b514af16b277cf53a2621da862c2207d5c125d04405dc', '72362726dd01ac644cd6303eaec0d1e3f4c4a646d037a1d99f29577b4423b2cd', '097357cfa21a6c252a567ac00100c16c0c7363ae2eabbe01b4f29ae1bd757ccc', '401989bf9009b566469a88cd5471c2694a7d87937a9fdcfbf4e88beef7efd39d', '05d46ca780c33b7d4cc2e53808174805f4047733b94dfbfb60ff9ed28f8dd11f', '533bcf2e9458af18293747d14f6beaf03bfbe6aaee16971ed01a3409d60a6bed', 'c0a463e6ab6e2bf21c5334f7aa429225ae0a3a83d89561c974700603a1ad2fea', '6a2abd92943aca5ceb86cd8ddba864a3e592db4b375a5f35878e5b9105a051df', '6716ff54b5f12bcd76acd503c9c2834699670a359a197829fa87674a3a378e2c', 'd0e43b6094ebbab447c2566cd18b2e3ad27bcad9f880ec82b7317cb0e51bc28e', '56a0fa0e058d82031e25d13ab6060ee144616dc49c9ce0469bc6ab03e5048ed4', 'ccfee4699da8f66d672051810c29cbcf0672370b57e27852f73592bf5fc3346b', 'f17fa9e91eea8268110040f5346eb308904d3d9c41e63783c19f740d2dbcb62f', '75829864c0d2734e58a4495f0b56fc86d235a611424c8517c772a5cb99705010', 'de2e17755cd7e97eba9ace329907924b830005b6addab5a19bd11663c9b85012', 'df9e64548c49f31f9af0c11028e205d8f1fac9ed8d98928f22fb69b4529f342c', '540fc1afc992e054f4b82a9729fce1694eb16f7968cad46c91618f4a559e4aff', '3ef9a445156679d4425cb0881a46f60e5bbe5db2079bb4446a80ef56051da3e5', '046f095864279a3ccafd504ba12bc7ca6afb13e98400c7d7cfcda2a418ab154f', '7b43c4c06c9fcacc41f119a11e080c782738986d7c54feaa3906064ff9cf5f18', '0c9b20d1467ef322839821ac5647d1d68226b1d0594be7a6192cc4f7e8d179c8', 'a1663645c2662a2457d37b7ba142b06e19faf7cbd84ec903ebf0208506311e6c', 'cb110c6c21c8e7437abc657745213fdcfced3861e70eb3d61c1d0b8903c14313', '5c8f95a3fa12c754ffe8f28a84deec3c86069a81881df313fc8cf985bc3436a5', '7ab95719759c5e321931f850258d2c65dcfb33e4cedb773cf388cfefb1b88b3a', 'c284b30931b5e9ed72b81195eb779074445fdef55bc3535715ea09fb015a1262', 'd8179128176f8a03efb439220069a0f8de7b763b92ddf606ebb11d7f5bf75ca9', 'e38044e419c31a000dd8606c22b12d472efd4ee78a2c0c2f4afc22188a3c9c87', 'ec7385b29c1eaa80be75d044cf1327c2163cf7dacfd053bbf03d295934d444d0', '9e3f2f8bf898962682bbdd9f3014e39df8d17b320beca4ec6c4d4d2c3f6ddada', '287183523cc3a2e7b7556dea816445e27c3eb4d9e909148a1f67fd23f93e5bec', 'f42345846207329ef2777ae915066f3b1886174b88b3340949d99c20a4b3fafa', '1076af38cbd8facfe90bcf676e02a9e43d3ab3ab6f22052988cdded05b70ea45', '41410b87505a5a09063eae6498d2fb0d9e0e293846314d404333ae3dcb2b0d37', '5bd3bda3c8cda4f4d213c3dc7b3fc73d91c01c50fcdf95e385158523d3611410', '335f518f6a0696cc191f487295368e47786d0e7e6d0e756d8e6798195ab76bf9', 'a693c971a4fbff92e143204c7a13b6b49e6c89fca268e7d56c0b89166fbb1ca2', '0881413aea5e88b9a80a6b5a4a8459fe0bcbbbe4942c2723c6f62daabe33fbff', '0c666a2ae61d2cce2c1edebc3f5802eda15291638a47c961fd2e99c5df430217', '7e89913118db45ac3801ef5f70d08e1be75cb67429f1615123a66af085eb22f6', '6faacafeac8fe820d96df147705b9c9496266576250becf44f676b2448111787', '480a59cebad5de7c0efbc602f445f72370f2a4e1c35238a5c2f68f9ca196b0f9']"

31,5868,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5868,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-10-10,Scott Aaronson,"Gaussian BosonSampling, higher-order correlations, and spoofing: An update","In my last post, I wrote (among other things) about an ongoing scientific debate between the group of Chaoyang Lu at USTC in China, which over the past year has been doing experiments that seek to demonstrate quantum supremacy via Gaussian BosonSampling; and the group of Sergio Boixo at Google, which had a recent paper on a polynomial-time classical algorithm to sample approximately from the same distributions. I reported the facts as I understood them at the time. Since then, though, a long call with the Google team gave me a new and different understanding, and I feel duty-bound to share that here.
A week ago, I considered it obvious that if, using a classical spoofer, you could beat the USTC experiment on a metric like total variation distance from the ideal distribution, then you would’ve completely destroyed USTC’s claim of quantum supremacy. The reason I believed that, in turn, is a proposition that I hadn’t given a name but needs one, so let me call it Hypothesis H:
The only way a classical algorithm to spoof BosonSampling can possibly do well in total variation distance, is by correctly reproducing the high-order correlations (correlations among the occupation numbers of large numbers of modes) — because that’s where the complexity of BosonSampling lies (if it lies anywhere).
Hypothesis H had important downstream consequences. Google’s algorithm, by the Google team’s own admission, does not reproduce the high-order correlations. Furthermore, because of limitations on both samples and classical computation time, Google’s paper calculates the total variation distance from the ideal distribution only on the marginal distribution on roughly 14 out of 144 modes. On that marginal distribution, Google’s algorithm does do better than the experiment in total variation distance. Google presents a claimed extrapolation to the full 144 modes, but eyeballing the graphs, it was far from clear to me what would happen: like, maybe the spoofing algorithm would continue to win, but maybe the experiment would turn around and win; who knows?
Chaoyang, meanwhile, made a clear prediction that the experiment would turn around and win, because of
- the experiment’s success in reproducing the high-order correlations,
- the admitted failure of Google’s algorithm in reproducing the high-order correlations, and
- the seeming impossibility of doing well on BosonSampling without reproducing the high-order correlations (Hypothesis H).
Given everything my experience told me about the central importance of high-order correlations for BosonSampling, I was inclined to agree with Chaoyang.
Now for the kicker: it seems that Hypothesis H is false. A classical spoofer could beat a BosonSampling experiment on total variation distance from the ideal distribution, without even bothering to reproduce the high-order correlations correctly.
This is true because of a combination of two facts about the existing noisy BosonSampling experiments. The first fact is that the contribution from the order-k correlations falls off like 1/exp(k). The second fact is that, due to calibration errors and the like, the experiments already show significant deviations from the ideal distribution on the order-1 and order-2 correlations.
Put these facts together and what do you find? Well, suppose your classical spoofing algorithm takes care to get the low-order contributions to the distribution exactly right. Just for that reason alone, it could already win over a noisy BosonSampling experiment, as judged by benchmarks like total variation distance from the ideal distribution, or for that matter linear cross-entropy. Yes, the experiment will beat the classical simulation on the higher-order correlations. But because those higher-order correlations are exponentially attenuated anyway, they won’t be enough to make up the difference. The experiment’s lack of perfection on the low-order correlations will swamp everything else.
Granted, I still don’t know for sure that this is what happens — that depends on whether I believe Sergio or Chaoyang about the extrapolation of the variation distance to the full 144 modes (my own eyeballs having failed to render a verdict!). But I now see that it’s logically possible, maybe even plausible.
So, let’s imagine for the sake of argument that Google’s simulation wins on variation distance, even though the experiment wins on the high-order correlations. In that case, what would be our verdict: would USTC have achieved quantum supremacy via BosonSampling, or not?
It’s clear what each side could say.
Google could say: by a metric that Scott Aaronson, the coinventor of BosonSampling, thought was perfectly adequate as late as last week — namely, total variation distance from the ideal distribution — we won. We achieved lower variation distance than USTC’s experiment, and we did it using a fast classical algorithm. End of discussion. No moving the goalposts after the fact.
Google could even add: BosonSampling is a sampling task; it’s right there in the name! The only purpose of any benchmark — whether Linear XEB or high-order correlation — is to give evidence about whether you are or aren’t sampling from a distribution close to the ideal one. But that means that, if you accept that we are doing the latter better than the experiment, then there’s nothing more to argue about.
USTC could respond: even if Scott Aaronson is the coinventor of BosonSampling, he’s extremely far from an infallible oracle. In the case at hand, his lack of appreciation for the sources of error in realistic experiments caused him to fixate inappropriately on variation distance as the success criterion. If you want to see the quantum advantage in our system, you have to deliberately subtract off the low-order correlations and look at the high-order correlations.
USTC could add: from the very beginning, the whole point of quantum supremacy experiments was to demonstrate a clear speedup on some benchmark — we never particularly cared which one! That horse is out of the barn as soon as we’re talking about quantum supremacy at all — something the Google group, which itself reported the first quantum supremacy experiment in Fall 2019, again for a completely artificial benchmark — knows as well as anyone else. (The Google team even has experience with adjusting benchmarks: when, for example, Pan and Zhang pointed out that Linear XEB as originally specified is pretty easy to spoof for random 2D circuits, the most cogent rejoinder was: OK, fine then, add an extra check that the returned samples are sufficiently different from one another, which kills Pan and Zhang’s spoofing strategy.) In that case, then, why isn’t a benchmark tailored to the high-order correlations as good as variation distance or linear cross-entropy or any other benchmark?
Both positions are reasonable and have merit — though I confess to somewhat greater sympathy for the one that appeals to my doofosity rather than my supposed infallibility!
OK, but suppose, again for the sake of argument, that we accepted the second position, and we said that USTC gets to declare quantum supremacy as long as its experiment does better than any known classical simulation at reproducing the high-order correlations. We’d still face the question: does the USTC experiment, in fact, do better on that metric? It would be awkward if, having won the right to change the rules in its favor, USTC still lost even under the new rules.
Sergio tells me that USTC directly reported experimental data only for up to order-7 correlations, and at least individually, the order-7 correlations are easy to reproduce on a laptop (although sampling in a way that reproduces the order-7 correlations might still be hard—a point that Chaoyang confirms, and where further research would be great). OK, but USTC also reported that their experiment seems to reproduce up to order-19 correlations. And order-19 correlations, the Google team agrees, are hard to sample consistently with on a classical computer by any currently known algorithm.
So then, why don’t we have direct data for the order-19 correlations? The trouble is simply that it would’ve taken USTC an astronomical amount of computation time. So instead, they relied on a statistical extrapolation from the observed strength of the lower-order correlations — there we go again with the extrapolations! Of course, if we’re going to let Google rest its case on an extrapolation, then maybe it’s only sporting to let USTC do the same.
You might wonder: why didn’t we have to worry about any of this stuff with the other path to quantum supremacy, the one via random circuit sampling with superconducting qubits? The reason is that, with random circuit sampling, all the correlations except the highest-order ones are completely trivial — or, to say it another way, the reduced state of any small number of output qubits is exponentially close to the maximally mixed state. This is a real difference between BosonSampling and random circuit sampling—and even 5-6 years ago, we knew that this represented an advantage for random circuit sampling, although I now have a deeper appreciation for just how great of an advantage it is. For it means that, with random circuit sampling, it’s easier to place a “sword in the stone”: to say, for example, here is the Linear XEB score achieved by the trivial classical algorithm that outputs random bits, and lo, our experiment achieves a higher score, and lo, we challenge anyone to invent a fast classical spoofing method that achieves a similarly high score.
With BosonSampling, by contrast, we have various metrics with which to judge performance, but so far, for none of those metrics do we have a plausible hypothesis that says “here’s the best that any polynomial-time classical algorithm can possibly hope to do, and it’s completely plausible that even a noisy current or planned BosonSampling experiment can do better than that.”
In the end, then, I come back to the exact same three goals I would’ve recommended a week ago for the future of quantum supremacy experiments, but with all of them now even more acutely important than before:
- Experimentally, to increase the fidelity of the devices (with BosonSampling, for example, to observe a larger contribution from the high-order correlations) — a much more urgent goal, from the standpoint of evading classical spoofing algorithms, than further increasing the dimensionality of the Hilbert space.
- Theoretically, to design better ways to verify the results of sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments classically — ideally, even ways that could be applied via polynomial-time tests.

32,5859,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5859,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-10-05,Scott Aaronson,"The Physics Nobel, Gaussian BosonSampling, and Dorian Abbot","1. Huge congratulations to the winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics: Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann for climate modelling, and separately, Giorgio Parisi for statistical physics. While I don’t know the others, I had the great honor to get to know Parisi three years ago, when he was chair of the committee that awarded me the Tomassoni-Chisesi Prize in Physics, and when I visited Parisi’s department at Sapienza University of Rome to give the prize lecture and collect the award. I remember Parisi’s kindness, a lot of good food, and a lot of discussion of the interplay between theoretical computer science and physics. Note that, while much of Parisi’s work is beyond my competence to comment on, in computer science he’s very well-known for applying statistical physics methods to the analysis of survey propagation—an algorithm that revolutionized the study of random 3SAT when it was introduced two decades ago.
2. Two weeks ago, a group at Google put out a paper with a new efficient classical algorithm to simulate the recent Gaussian BosonSampling experiments from USTC in China. They argued that this algorithm called into question USTC’s claim of BosonSampling-based quantum supremacy. Since then, I’ve been in contact with Sergio Boixo from Google, Chaoyang Lu from USTC, and Jelmer Renema, a Dutch BosonSampling expert and friend of the blog, to try to get to the bottom of this. Very briefly, the situation seems to be that Google’s new algorithm outperforms the USTC experiment on one particular metric: namely, total variation distance from the ideal marginal distribution, if (crucially) you look at only a subset of the optical modes, say 14 modes out of 144 total. Meanwhile, though, if you look at the kth-order correlations for large values of k, then the USTC experiment continues to win. With the experiment, the correlations fall off exponentially with k but still have a meaningful, detectable signal even for (say) k=19, whereas with Google’s spoofing algorithm, you choose the k that you want to spoof (say, 2 or 3), and then the correlations become nonsense for larger k.
Now, given that you were only ever supposed to see a quantum advantage from BosonSampling if you looked at the kth-order correlations for large values of k, and given that we already knew, from the work of Leonid Gurvits, that very small marginals in BosonSampling experiments would be easy to reproduce on a classical computer, my inclination is to say that USTC’s claim of BosonSampling-based quantum supremacy still stands. On the other hand, it’s true that, with BosonSampling especially, more so than with qubit-based random circuit sampling, we currently lack an adequate theoretical understanding of what the target should be. That is, which numerical metric should an experiment aim to maximize, and how well does it have to score on that metric before it’s plausibly outperforming any fast classical algorithm? One thing I feel confident about is that, whichever metric is chosen—Linear Cross-Entropy or whatever else—it needs to capture the kth-order correlations for large values of k. No metric that’s insensitive to those correlations is good enough.
3. Like many others, I was outraged and depressed that MIT uninvited Dorian Abbot (see also here), a geophysicist at the University of Chicago, who was slated to give the Carlson Lecture in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences about the atmospheres of extrasolar planets. The reason for the cancellation was that, totally unrelatedly to his scheduled lecture, Abbot had argued in Newsweek and elsewhere that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives should aim for equality for opportunity rather than equality of outcomes, a Twitter-mob decided to go after him in retaliation, and they succeeded. It should go without saying that it’s perfectly reasonable to disagree with Abbot’s stance, to counterargue—if those very concepts haven’t gone the way of floppy disks. It should also go without saying that the MIT EAPS department chair is free to bow to social-media pressure, as he did, rather than standing on principle … just like I’m free to criticize him for it. To my mind, though, cancelling a scientific talk because of the speaker’s centrist (!) political views completely, 100% validates the right’s narrative about academia, that it’s become a fanatically intolerant echo chamber. To my fellow progressive academics, I beseech thee in the bowels of Bertrand Russell: why would you commit such an unforced error?
Yes, one can imagine views (e.g., open Nazism) so hateful that they might justify the cancellation of unrelated scientific lectures by people who hold those views, as many physicists after WWII refused to speak to Werner Heisenberg. But it seems obvious to me—as it would’ve been obvious to everyone else not long ago—that no matter where a reasonable person draws the line, Abbot’s views as he expressed them in Newsweek don’t come within a hundred miles of it. To be more explicit still: if Abbot’s views justify deplatforming him as a planetary scientist, then all my quantum computing and theoretical computer science lectures deserve to be cancelled too, for the many attempts I’ve made on this blog over the past 16 years to share my honest thoughts and life experiences, to write like a vulnerable human being rather than like a university press office. While I’m sure some sneerers gleefully embrace that implication, I ask everyone else to consider how deeply they believe in the idea of academic freedom at all—keeping in mind that such a commitment only ever gets tested when there’s a chance someone might denounce you for it.
Update: Princeton’s James Madison Program has volunteered to host Abbot’s Zoom talk in place of MIT. The talk is entitled “Climate and the Potential for Life on Other Planets.” Like probably hundreds of others who heard about this only because of the attempted cancellation, I plan to attend!

Of course, repentance is meaningless unless accompanied by genuine reform. That being the case, please enjoy the YouTube video of my ACM TechTalk from last week about quantum supremacy—although, as you’ll see if you watch the thing, I oscillate between quantum supremacy and other terms like “quantum advantage” and even “quantum supremadvantage.” This represents the first time ever that I got pushback about a talk before I’d delivered it for political reasons—the social-justice people, it turns out, are actually serious about wanting to ban the term “quantum supremacy”—but my desire to point out all the difficulties with their proposal competed with my desire not to let that issue overshadow my talk.
And there’s plenty to talk about! While regular Shtetl-Optimized readers will have already heard (or read) most of what I say, I make some new comments, including about the new paper from last week, the night before my talk (!), by the USTC group in China, where they report a quantum supremacy experiment based on random circuit sampling with a superconducting chip, this time with a record-setting 60 qubits and 24 layers of gates. On the other hand, I also stress how increasing the circuit fidelity has become a much more urgent issue than further increasing the number of qubits (or in the case of BosonSampling, the number of photons), if our goal is for these experiments to remain a couple steps ahead of classical spoofing algorithms.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy my lovingly handcrafted visuals. Over the course of this pandemic, I’ve become a full convert to writing out my talks with a stylus pen rather than PowerPointing them—not only is it faster for me, not only does it allow for continuous scrolling rather than arbitrary divisions into slides, but it enforces simplicity and concision in ways they should be enforced.
While there was only time for me to field a few questions at the end of the talk, I later supplied written answers to 52 questions (!!) that I hadn’t gotten to. If you have a question, please check to see if it’s already there, and otherwise ask away in the comments!

I posed more open quantum complexity problems in 2010, and some classical complexity problems in 2011. In the latter cases, I’d say there’s been dramatic progress on about a third of the problems. I won’t go through the problems one by one, but feel free to ask in the comments about any that interest you.
Shall I push my luck as a problem-poser? Shall or shall not, I have.
My impetus, this time around, was a kind invitation by Travis Humble, the editor-in-chief of the new ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing, to contribute a perspective piece to that journal on the occasion of my ACM Prize. I agreed—but only on the condition that, rather than ponderously pontificate about the direction of the field, I could simply discuss a bunch of open problems that I wanted to see solved. The result is below. It’s coming soon to an arXiv near you, but Shtetl-Optimized readers get it first.
Open Problems Related to Quantum Query Complexity (11 pages, PDF)
by Scott Aaronson
Abstract: I offer a case that quantum query complexity still has loads of enticing and fundamental open problems—from relativized QMA versus QCMA and BQP versus IP, to time/space tradeoffs for collision and element distinctness, to polynomial degree versus quantum query complexity for partial functions, to the Unitary Synthesis Problem and more.
Some of the problems on my new hit-list are ones that I and others have flogged for years or even decades, but others, as far as I know, appear here for the first time. If your favorite quantum query complexity open problem, or a problem I’ve discussed in the past, is missing, that doesn’t mean that it’s been solved or is no longer interesting—it might mean I simply ran out of time or energy before I got to it.
Enjoy!

36,5730,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5730,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-08-13,Scott Aaronson,Stephen Wiesner (1942-2021),"These have not been an auspicious few weeks for Jewish-American-born theoretical physicists named Steve who made epochal contributions to human knowledge in the late 1960s, and who I had the privilege to get to know a bit when they were old.
This morning, my friend and colleague Or Sattath brought me the terrible news that Stephen Wiesner has passed away in Israel. [Because people have asked: I’ve now also heard directly from Wiesner’s daughter Sarah.]
Decades ago, Wiesner left academia, embraced Orthodox Judaism, moved from the US to Israel, and took up work there as a construction laborer—believing (or so he told me) that manual labor was good for the soul. In the late 1960s, however, Wiesner was still a graduate student in physics at Columbia University, when he wrote Conjugate Coding: arguably the foundational document of the entire field of quantum information science.
Famously, this paper was so far ahead of its time that it was rejected over and over from journals, taking nearly 15 years to get published. (Fascinatingly, Gilles Brassard tells me that this isn’t true: it was rejected once, from IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, and then Wiesner simply shelved it.) When it finally appeared, in 1983, it was in SIGACT News—a venue that I know and love, where I’ve published too, but that’s more like the house newsletter for theoretical computer scientists than an academic journal.
But it didn’t matter. By the early 1980s, Wiesner’s ideas had been successfully communicated to Charlie Bennett and Gilles Brassard, who refashioned them into the first scheme for quantum key distribution—what we now call BB84. Even as Bennett and Brassard received scientific acclaim for the invention of quantum cryptography—including, a few years ago, the Wolf Prize (often considered second only to the Nobel Prize), at a ceremony in the Knesset in Jerusalem that I attended—the two B’s were always careful to acknowledge their massive intellectual debt to Steve Wiesner.
Let me explain what Wiesner does in the Conjugate Coding paper. As far as I know, this is the first paper ever to propose that quantum information—what Wiesner called “polarized light” or “spin-1/2 particles” but we now simply call qubits—works differently than classical bits, in ways that could actually be useful for achieving cryptographic tasks that are impossible in a classical world. What could enable these cryptographic applications, wrote Wiesner, is the fact that there’s no physical means for an attacker or eavesdropper to copy an unknown qubit, to produce a second qubit in the same quantum state. This observation—now called the No-Cloning Theorem—would only be named and published in 1982, but Wiesner treats it in his late-1960s manuscript as just obvious background.
Wiesner went further than these general ideas, though, to propose an explicit scheme for quantum money that would be physically impossible to counterfeit—a scheme that’s still of enormous interest half a century later (I teach it every year in my undergraduate course). In what we now call the Wiesner money scheme, a central bank prints “quantum bills,” each of which contains a classical serial number as well as a long string of qubits. Each qubit is prepared in one of four possible quantum states:
- |0⟩,
- |1⟩,
- |+⟩ = (|0⟩+|1⟩)/√2, or
- |-⟩ = (|0⟩-|1⟩)/√2.
The bank, in a central database, stores the serial number of every bill in circulation, as well as the preparation instructions for each of the bill’s qubits. If you want to verify a bill as genuine—this, as Wiesner knew, is the big drawback—you have to bring it back to the bank. The bank, using its secret knowledge of how each qubit was prepared, measures each qubit in the appropriate basis—the {|0⟩,|1⟩} basis for |0⟩ or |1⟩ qubits, the {|+⟩,|-⟩} basis for |+⟩ or |-⟩ qubits—and checks that it gets the expected outcomes. If even one qubit yields the wrong outcome, the bill is rejected as counterfeit.
Now consider the situation of a counterfeiter, who holds a quantum bill but lacks access to the bank’s secret database. When the counterfeiter tries to copy the bill, they won’t know the right basis in which to measure each qubit—and if they make the wrong choice, then it’s not only that they fail to make a copy; it’s that the measurement destroys even the original copy! For example, measuring a |+⟩ or |-⟩ qubit in the {|0⟩,|1⟩} basis will randomly collapse the qubit to either |0⟩ or |1⟩—so that, when the bank later measures the same qubit in the correct {|+⟩,|-⟩} basis, it will see the wrong outcome, and realize that the bill has been compromised, with 1/2 probability (with the probability increasing to nearly 1 as we repeat across hundreds or thousands of qubits).
Admittedly, the handwavy argument above, which Wiesner offered, is far from a security proof by cryptographers’ standards. In 2011, I pointed that out on StackExchange. My post, I’m happy to say, spurred Molina, Vidick, and Watrous to write a beautiful 2012 paper, where they rigorously proved for the first time that in Wiesner’s money scheme, no counterfeiter consistent with the laws of quantum mechanics can turn a single n-qubit bill into two bills that both pass the bank’s verification with success probability greater than (3/4)n (and this is tight). But the intuition was already clear enough to Wiesner in the 1960s.
In 2003—when I was already a PhD student in quantum information, but incredibly, had never heard of Stephen Wiesner or his role in founding my field—I rediscovered the idea of quantum states |ψ⟩ that you could store, measure, and feed into a quantum computer, but that would be usefully uncopyable. (My main interest was in whether you could create “unpiratable quantum software programs.”) Only in 2006, at the University of Waterloo, did Michele Mosca and his students make the connection for me to quantum money, Stephen Wiesner, and his Conjugate Coding paper, which I then read with amazement—along with a comparably amazing followup work by Bennett, Brassard, Breidbart, and Wiesner.
But it was clear that there was still a great deal to do. Besides unpiratable software, Wiesner and his collaborators had lacked the tools in the early 1980s seriously to tackle the problem of secure quantum money that anybody could verify, not only the bank that had created the money. I realized that, if such a thing was possible at all, then just like unpiratable software, it would require cryptographic hardness assumptions, a restriction to polynomial-time counterfeiters, and (hence) ideas from quantum computational complexity. The No-Cloning Theorem couldn’t do the job on its own.
That realization led to my 2009 paper Quantum Copy-Protection and Quantum Money, and from there, to the “modern renaissance” of Wiesner’s old idea of quantum money, with well over a hundred papers (e.g., my 2012 paper with Paul Christiano, Farhi et al.’s quantum state restoration paper, their quantum money from knots paper, Mark Zhandry’s 2017 quantum lightning paper, Dmitry Gavinsky’s improvement of Wiesner’s scheme wherein the money is verified by classical communication with the bank, Broduch et al.’s adaptive attack on Wiesner’s original scheme, my shadow tomography paper proving the necessity for the bank to keep a giant database in information-theoretic quantum money schemes like Wiesner’s, Daniel Kane’s strange scheme based on modular forms…). The purpose of many of these papers was either to break the quantum money schemes proposed in previous papers, or to patch the schemes that were previously broken.
After all this back-and-forth, spanning more than a decade, I’d say that Wiesner’s old idea of quantum money is now in good enough theoretical shape that the main obstacle to its practical realization is merely the “engineering difficulty”—namely, how to get the qubits in a bill, sitting in your pocket or whatever, to maintain their quantum coherence for more than a few nanoseconds! (Or possibly a few hours, if you’re willing to schlep a cryogenic freezer everywhere you go.) It’s precisely because quantum key distribution doesn’t have this storage problem—because there the qubits are simply sent across a channel and then immediately measured on arrival—that QKD is actually practical today, although the market for it has proven to be extremely limited so far.
In the meantime, while the world waits for the quantum error-correction that could keep qubits alive indefinitely, there’s Bitcoin. The latter perversely illustrates just how immense the demand for quantum money might someday be: the staggering lengths to which people will go, diverting the electricity to power whole nations into mining rigs, to get around our current inability to realize Wiesner’s elegant quantum-mechanical solution to the same problem. When I first learned about Bitcoin, shortly after its invention, it was in the context of: “here’s something I’d better bring up in my lectures on quantum money, in order to explain how much better WiesnerCoin could eventually be, when it’s the year 2200 or whatever and we all have quantum computers wired up by a quantum Internet!” It never occurred to me that I should forget about the year 2200, liquidate my life savings, and immediately buy up all the Bitcoin I could. [Added: I’ve since learned that Wiesner’s daughter Sarah is a professional in the Bitcoin space.]
In his decades as a construction laborer, Wiesner had (as far as I know) no Internet presence; many of my colleagues didn’t even realize he was still alive. Even then, though, Wiesner never turned his back so far on his previous life, his academic life, that the quantum information faculty at Hebrew University in Jerusalem couldn’t entice him to participate in some seminars there. Those seminars are where I had the privilege to meet and talk to him several times over the last decade. He was thoughtful and kind, listening with interest as I told him how I and others were trying to take quantum money into the modern era by making it publicly verifiable.
I also vividly remember a conversation in 2013 where Steve shared his fears about the American physics establishment and military-industrial complex, and passionately urged me to
- quit academia and get a “real job,” and
- flee the US immediately and move my family to Israel, because of a wave of fascism and antisemitism that was about to sweep the US, just like with Germany in the 1930s.
I politely nodded along, pointing out that my Israeli wife and I had considered living in Israel but the job opportunities were better in US, silently wondering when Steve had gone completely off his rocker. Today, Steve’s urgent warning about an impending fascist takeover of the US seems … uh, slightly less crazy than in 2013? Maybe, just like with quantum money, Wiesner was simply too far ahead of his time to sound sane.
Wiesner also talked to me about his father, Jerome Wiesner, who was a legendary president of MIT—still spoken about in reverent tones when I taught there—as well as the chief science advisor to John F. Kennedy. One of JFK’s most famous decisions was to override the elder Wiesner’s fervent opposition to sending humans to the moon (Wiesner thought it a waste of money, as robots could do the same science for vastly cheaper).
While I don’t know all the details (I hope someone someday researches it and writes a book), Steve Wiesner made it clear to me that he did not get along with his famous father at all—in fact they became estranged. Steve told me that his embrace of Orthodox Judaism was, at least in part, a reaction against everything his father had stood for, including militant scientific atheism. I suppose that in the 1960s, millions of young Americans defied their parents via sex, drugs, and acoustic guitar; only a tiny number did so by donning tzitzit and moving to Israel to pray and toil with their hands. The two groups of rebels did, however, share a tendency to grow long beards.
Wiesner’s unique, remarkable, uncloneable life trajectory raises the question: who are the young Stephen Wiesners of our time? Will we be faster to recognize their foresight than Wiesner’s contemporaries were to recognize his?
Feel free to share any other memories of Stephen Wiesner or his influence in the comments.
Update (Aug. 14): See also Or Sattath’s memorial post, which (among other things) points out something that my narrative missed: namely, besides quantum money, Wiesner also invented superdense coding in 1970, although he and Bennett only published the idea 22 years later (!).
And I have more photos! Here’s Wiesner with an invention of his and another photo (thanks to his daughter Sarah). Here’s another photo from 1970 and Charlie Bennett’s handwritten notes (!) after first meeting Wiesner in 1970 (thanks to Charlie Bennett).
Another Update: Stephen’s daughter Sarah gave me the following fascinating information to share.
In the 70’s he lived in California where he worked in various Silicon Valley startups while also working weekends as part of a produce (fruits and vegetables) distribution co-op.

37,5706,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5706,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-08-10,Scott Aaronson,Yet more mistakes in papers,"Amazing Update (Aug. 19): My former PhD student Daniel Grier tells me that he, Sergey Bravyi, and David Gosset have an arXiv preprint, from February, where they give a corrected proof of my and Andris Ambainis’s claim that any k-query quantum algorithm can be simulated by an O (N1-1/2k)-query classical randomized algorithm (albeit, not of our stronger statement, about a randomized algorithm to estimate any bounded low-degree real polynomial). The reason I hadn’t known about this is that they don’t mention it in the abstract of their paper (!!). But it’s right there in Theorem 5.
In my last post, I came down pretty hard on the blankfaces: people who relish their power to persist in easily-correctable errors, to the detriment of those subject to their authority. The sad truth, though, is that I don’t obviously do better than your average blankface in my ability to resist falsehoods on early encounter with them. As one of many examples that readers of this blog might know, I didn’t think covid seemed like a big deal in early February 2020—although by mid-to-late February 2020, I’d repented of my doofosity. If I have any tool with which to unblank my face, then it’s only my extreme self-consciousness when confronted with evidence of my own stupidities—the way I’ve trained myself over decades in science to see error-correction as a or even the fundamental virtue.
Which brings me to today’s post. Continuing what’s become a Shtetl-Optimized tradition—see here from 2014, here from 2016, here from 2017—I’m going to fess up to two serious mistakes in research papers on which I was a coauthor.
In 2015, Andris Ambainis and I had a STOC paper entitled Forrelation: A Problem that Optimally Separates Quantum from Classical Computing. We gave two main results there:
- A Ω((√N)/log(N)) lower bound on the randomized query complexity of my “Forrelation” problem, which was known to be solvable with only a single quantum query.
- A proposed way to take any k-query quantum algorithm that queries an N-bit string, and simulate it using only O(N1-1/2k) classical randomized queries.
Later, Bansal and Sinha and independently Sherstov, Storozhenko, and Wu showed that a k-query generalization of Forrelation, which I’d also defined, requires ~Ω(N1-1/2k) classical randomized queries, in line with my and Andris’s conjecture that k-fold Forrelation optimally separates quantum and classical query complexities.
A couple months ago, alas, my former grad school officemate Andrej Bogdanov, along with Tsun Ming Cheung and Krishnamoorthy Dinesh, emailed me and Andris to say that they’d discovered an error in result 2 of our paper (result 1, along with the Bansal-Sinha and Sherstov-Storozhenko-Wu extensions of it, remained fine). So, adding our own names, we’ve now posted a preprint on ECCC that explains the error, while also showing how to recover our result for the special case k=1: that is, any 1-query quantum algorithm really can be simulated using only O(√N) classical randomized queries.
Read the preprint if you really want to know the details of the error, but to summarize it in my words: Andris and I used a trick that we called “variable-splitting” to handle variables that have way more influence than average on the algorithm’s acceptance probability. Alas, variable-splitting fails to take care of a situation where there are a bunch of variables that are non-influential individually, but that on some unusual input string, can “conspire” in such a way that their signs all line up and their contribution overwhelms those from the other variables. A single mistaken inequality fooled us into thinking such cases were handled, but an explicit counterexample makes the issue obvious.
I still conjecture that my original guess was right: that is, I conjecture that any problem solvable with k quantum queries is solvable with O(N1-1/2k) classical randomized queries, so that k-fold Forrelation is the extremal example, and so that no problem has constant quantum query complexity but linear randomized query complexity. More strongly, I reiterate the conjecture that any bounded degree-d real polynomial, p:{0,1}N→[0,1], can be approximated by querying only O(N1-1/d) input bits drawn from some suitable distribution. But proving these conjectures, if they’re true, will require a new algorithmic idea.
Now for the second mea culpa. Earlier this year, my student Sabee Grewal and I posted a short preprint on the arXiv entitled Efficient Learning of Non-Interacting Fermion Distributions. In it, we claimed to give a classical algorithm for reconstructing any “free fermionic state” |ψ⟩—that is, a state of n identical fermionic particles, like electrons, each occupying one of m>n possible modes, that can be produced using only “fermionic beamsplitters” and no interaction terms—and for doing so in polynomial time and using a polynomial number of samples (i.e., measurements of where all the fermions are, given a copy of |ψ⟩). Alas, after trying to reply to confused comments from readers and reviewers (albeit, none of them exactly putting their finger on the problem), Sabee and I were able to figure out that we’d done no such thing.
Let me explain the error, since it’s actually really interesting. In our underlying problem, we’re trying to find a collection of unit vectors, call them |v1⟩,…,|vm⟩, in Cn. Here, again, n is the number of fermions and m>n is the number of modes. By measuring the “2-mode correlations” (i.e., the probability of finding a fermion in both mode i and mode j), we can figure out the approximate value of |⟨vi|vj⟩|—i.e., the absolute value of the inner product—for any i≠j. From that information, we want to recover |v1⟩,…,|vm⟩ themselves—or rather, their relative configuration in n-dimensional space, isometries being irrelevant.
It seemed to me and Sabee that, if we knew ⟨vi|vj⟩ for all i≠j, then we’d get linear equations that iteratively constrained each |vj⟩ in terms of ⟨vi|vj⟩ for j<i, so all we’d need to do is solve those linear systems, and then (crucially, and this was the main work we did) show that the solution would be robust with respect to small errors in our estimates of each ⟨vi|vj⟩. It seemed further to us that, while it was true that the measurements only revealed |⟨vi|vj⟩| rather than ⟨vi|vj⟩ itself, the “phase information” in ⟨vi|vj⟩ was manifestly irrelevant, as it in any case depended on the irrelevant global phases of |vi⟩ and |vj⟩ themselves.
Alas, it turns out that the phase information does matter. As an example, suppose I told you only the following about three unit vectors |u⟩,|v⟩,|w⟩ in R3:
|⟨u|v⟩| = |⟨u|w⟩| = |⟨v|w⟩| = 1/2.
Have I thereby determined these vectors up to isometry? Nope! In one class of solution, all three vectors belong to the same plane, like so:
|u⟩=(1,0,0),
|v⟩=(1/2,(√3)/2,0),
|w⟩=(-1/2,(√3)/2,0).
In a completely different class of solution, the three vectors don’t belong to the same plane, and instead look like three edges of a tetrahedron meeting at a vertex:
|u⟩=(1,0,0),
|v⟩=(1/2,(√3)/2,0),
|w⟩=(1/2,1/(2√3),√(2/3)).
These solutions correspond to different sign choices for |⟨u|v⟩|, |⟨u|w⟩|, and |⟨v|w⟩|—choices that collectively matter, even though each of them is individually irrelevant.
It follows that, even in the special case where the vectors are all real, the 2-mode correlations are not enough information to determine the vectors’ relative positions. (Well, it takes some more work to convert this to a counterexample that could actually arise in the fermion problem, but that work can be done.) And alas, the situation gets even gnarlier when, as for us, the vectors can be complex.
Any possible algorithm for our problem will have to solve a system of nonlinear equations (albeit, a massively overconstrained system that’s guaranteed to have a solution), and it will have to use 3-mode correlations (i.e., statistics of triples of fermions), and quite possibly 4-mode correlations and above.
But now comes the good news! Googling revealed that, for reasons having nothing to do with fermions or quantum physics, problems extremely close to ours had already been studied in classical machine learning. The key term here is “Determinantal Point Processes” (DPPs). A DPP is a model where you specify an m×m matrix A (typically symmetric or Hermitian), and then the probabilities of various events are given by the determinants of various principal minors of A. Which is precisely what happens with fermions! In terms of the vectors |v1⟩,…,|vm⟩ that I was talking about before, to make this connection we simply let A be the m×m covariance matrix, whose (i,j) entry equals ⟨vi|vj⟩.
I first learned of this remarkable correspondence between fermions and DPPs a decade ago, from a talk on DPPs that Ben Taskar gave at MIT. Immediately after the talk, I made a mental note that Taskar was a rising star in theoretical machine learning, and that his work would probably be relevant to me in the future. While researching this summer, I was devastated to learn that Taskar died of heart failure in 2013, in his mid-30s and only a couple of years after I’d heard him speak.
The most relevant paper for me and Sabee was called An Efficient Algorithm for the Symmetric Principal Minor Assignment Problem, by Rising, Kulesza, and Taskar. Using a combinatorial algorithm based on minimum spanning trees and chordless cycles, this paper nearly solves our problem, except for two minor details:
- It doesn’t do an error analysis, and
- It considers complex symmetric matrices, whereas our matrix A is Hermitian (i.e., it equals its conjugate transpose, not its transpose).
So I decided to email Alex Kulezsa, one of Taskar’s surviving collaborators who’s now a research scientist at Google NYC, to ask his thoughts about the Hermitian case. Alex kindly replied that they’d been meaning to study that case—a reviewer had even asked about it!—but they’d ran into difficulties and didn’t know what it was good for. I asked Alex whether he’d like to join forces with me and Sabee in tackling the Hermitian case, which (I told him) was enormously relevant in quantum physics. To my surprise and delight, Alex agreed.
So we’ve been working on the problem together, making progress, and I’m optimistic that we’ll have some nice result. By using the 3-mode correlations, at least “generically” we can recover the entries of the matrix A up to complex conjugation, but further ideas will be needed to resolve the complex conjugation ambiguity, to whatever extent it actually matters.
In short: on the negative side, there’s much more to the problem of learning a fermionic state than we’d realized. But on the positive side, there’s much more to the problem than we’d realized! As with the simulation of k-query quantum algorithms, my coauthors and I would welcome any ideas. And I apologize to anyone who was misled by our premature (and hereby retracted) claims.
Update (Aug. 11): Here’s a third bonus retraction, which I thank my colleague Mark Wilde for bringing to my attention. Way back in 2005, in my NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality survey article, I “left it as an exercise for the reader” to prove that BQPCTC, or quantum polynomial time augmented with Deutschian closed timelike curves, is contained in a complexity class called SQG (Short Quantum Games). While it turns out to be true that BQPCTC ⊆ SQG—as follows from my and Watrous’s 2008 result that BQPCTC = PSPACE, combined with Gutoski and Wu’s 2010 result that SQG = PSPACE—it’s not something for which I could possibly have had a correct proof back in 2005. I.e., it was a harder exercise than I’d intended!",11610,"['4b9ab704693cca8bb71979f23afb390a92e190d131c6c205f656b62a99215d33', 'a3e16cd73dd088ba47fc0552242268e85355e883cb50ac10868dbd270c4dc468', '53e81b46d30432be4ee9268b34fc2aa37744c62ba38b2e4bee8ed8c8c2e5bf73', '6582b6662f5d045e62c16e4a2b8971846b7dbf25b90e891405c8ed829d9ec941', 'e486a3d1ca0b1c2b41756954f042e3f342fe83e9cb32a4af738391194a11c6ef', '575bae6d57057549d086e95b8198ecb48deb8497d647289a556e3f5b4d6a5afd', '60d9ee9c854e009a02e7945ee167633d1cfadeae6643ea06959c70422f0bce22', '5b0f2a67d127905821a5e150230b1458c677d9516dbd0f889bcc701448200720', 'bd6a04cf248b968bb8b5f11307827473214d58469587ef923f5910055d49ee74', 'b2cbf34ab4e0035bd88c690f325933cbf8fbf88c51b6f434cbdc164ac61d2eee', '0dd825eeeee8a6aa46c5afc2a2e3ad8cb0b6cd9baf294d3c8dfcbc3e5ddfe59a', '64b206a75f2fd204abeb66149a89dc55bc6577733bb30dcbbaa0eff5e3fe53ad', '07cb600b3393f0dfa3135c8d6fd28287eb801901c647ebb676dcd3f062a223f2', '8c97ecd94dbc000b1f1456d991b7dbc7bbb11dff9e62b2d0a78a341a0e9b3548', 'bcf0a7776fbb9a63e4df445e512329d5a646d9390cef54a6173dc846528f05ed', 'c099e560d87eaca106afcbd18d1d91c0afe650edcc9f627e788f34d1d42a8f88', '2edfa297e07f08482a1845277f4f476e051c3b018a23322833dd5a400c63373e', 'efc11a4ab29aa0c8d30a4709d4e86443abbd2f3c549166f0f64ff9f985e36da8']"

- Victor Galitski has an impassioned rant against out-of-control quantum computing hype, which I enjoyed and enthusiastically recommend, although I wished Galitski had engaged a bit more with the strongest arguments for optimism (e.g., the recent sampling-based supremacy experiments, the extrapolations that show gate fidelities crossing the fault-tolerance threshold within the next decade). Even if I’ve been saying similar things on this blog for 15 years, I clearly haven’t been doing so in a style that works for everyone. Quantum information needs as many people as possible who will tell the truth as best they see it, unencumbered by any competing interests, and has nothing legitimate to fear from that. The modern intersection of quantum theory and computer science has raised profound scientific questions that will be with us for decades to come. It’s a lily that need not be gilded with hype.
- Last month Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas posted an exciting preprint to ECCC, which apparently proves the first (slightly) superpolynomial lower bound on the size of constant-depth arithmetic circuits, over fields of characteristic 0. Assuming it’s correct, this is another small victory in the generations-long war against the P vs. NP problem.
- I’m grateful to the Texas Democratic legislators who fled the state to prevent the legislature, a couple miles from my house, having a quorum to enact new voting restrictions, and who thereby drew national attention to the enormity of what’s at stake. It should go without saying that, if a minority gets to rule indefinitely by forcing through laws to suppress the votes of a majority that would otherwise unseat it, thereby giving itself the power to force through more such laws, etc., then we no longer live in a democracy but in a banana republic. And there’s no symmetry to the situation: no matter how terrified you (or I) might feel about wokeists and their denunciation campaigns, the Democrats have no comparable effort to suppress Republican votes. Alas, I don’t know of any solutions beyond the obvious one, of trying to deal the conspiracy-addled grievance party crushing defeats in 2022 and 2024.

The group of Chaoyang Lu and Jianwei Pan, based at USTC in China, has been on a serious quantum supremacy tear lately. Recall that last December, USTC announced the achievement of quantum supremacy via Gaussian BosonSampling, with 50-70 detected photons—the second claim of sampling-based quantum supremacy, after Google’s in Fall 2019. However, skeptics then poked holes in the USTC claim, showing how they could spoof the results with a classical computer, basically by reproducing the k-photon correlations for relatively small values of k. Debate over the details continues, but the Chinese group seeks to render the debate largely moot with a new and better Gaussian BosonSampling experiment, with 144 modes and up to 113 detected photons. They say they were able to measure k-photon correlations for k up to about 19, which if true would constitute a serious obstacle to the classical simulation strategies that people discussed for the previous experiment.
In the meantime, though, an overlapping group of authors had put out another paper the day before (!) reporting a sampling-based quantum supremacy experiment using superconducting qubits—extremely similar to what Google did (the same circuit depth and everything), except now with 56 qubits rather than 53.
I confess that I haven’t yet studied either paper in detail—among other reasons, because I’m on vacation with my family at the beach, and because I’m trying to spend what work-time I have on my own projects. But anyone who has read them, please use the comments of this post to discuss! Hopefully I’ll learn something.
To confine myself to some general comments: since Google’s announcement in Fall 2019, I’ve consistently said that sampling-based quantum supremacy is not yet a done deal. I’ve said that quantum supremacy seems important enough to want independent replications, and demonstrations in other hardware platforms like ion traps and photonics, and better gate fidelity, and better classical hardness, and better verification protocols. Most of all, I’ve said that we needed a genuine dialogue between the “quantum supremacists” and the classical skeptics: the former doing experiments and releasing all their data, the latter trying to design efficient classical simulations for those experiments, and so on in an iterative process. Just like in applied cryptography, we’d only have real confidence in a quantum supremacy claim once it had survived at least a few years of attacks by skeptics. So I’m delighted that this is precisely what’s now happening. USTC’s papers are two new volleys in this back-and-forth; we all eagerly await the next volley, whichever side it comes from.
While I’ve been trying for years to move away from the expectation that I blog about each and every QC announcement that someone messages me about, maybe I’ll also say a word about the recent announcement by IBM of a quantum advantage in space complexity (see here for popular article and here for arXiv preprint). There appears to be a nice theoretical result here, about the ability to evaluate any symmetric Boolean function with a single qubit in a branching-program-like model. I’d love to understand that result better. But to answer the question I received, this is another case where, once you know the protocol, you know both that the experiment can be done and exactly what its result will be (namely, the thing predicted by QM). So I think the interest is almost entirely in the protocol itself.",3502,"['3e3eb6015204ffc5b4a28b3d76581c514af40d31791ba15b25d7e1d842c5adcf', 'a78800ba72ff5249dde2e3bec4f9ca4b28e02fa7e97ac10d192d5c6ec461a7d9', 'ea4297f010e19479fb7974b6ecd4f241cdfb7c73867060406580202e5c3a5022', 'fb6820060af46ba0f042e93c7c7bd02705c745c8fbff381739f760faf576027c', '1afafd81e7a8359234adcbc9c9ffcd5ce86a320899b506f620058d39193deee4', '83c52b4c18a26034ea3a05b6142abd949ad5e528d75c231033f8238d5925690a', '6a4fc242f1f83c620cf9927f358b6359da3cc3f4453795eec088a2121c5f42a3', '97312f63e1b72beec1b6ff0c94e8520be2d48d890211e9a3323877e93b61082f', 'db670404ff1c19db5bbebb342c829c9c369fe56b213edaab917d055652a848fd', '87542557791d1f292180e85c71cdbf98640523e03b08bbcabddf24de1b020400', '646e1eff87785eea409ba89ec22104b822afc41d328b01a2b209dbd275f0e052', '17290fcd42c7a738b62b4db830acc7b13be1efa5993af2088474cc327ef71842', '4fb430c319fecf6037197310bc395cfaf60c9c0af35745cc776ecffbad288cd1', 'ad9344f33cf73a9758a343a1cb59e3edb3af57e0cfd4d963b428e78e71280f19', 'fb12ca0ec9a4eb6eaecee79d2e07dcfb0dc634f290daa6f8812976d16064540f', 'be63bcee39c9ecebb2a2a546a7c3e649720d11f54c8f4cef6a25afa1be3e1e7a', '2dab4c2a54a90d6a240d440668c3c193cfbf2be783da71c560875925955ccf3b', '0d513cd38a1276f86cbfecb141ca821083fc20b5aef5ab80b5b808433228e462', '59becfca2cdb10bc48293eb30fda52c23def10f03932e76f0bebc412550ef10c', '1c52252f7b1a2913b3736fc934d6dd194e7e2abdbf75c923ed4c6fbbca789660', '2afde43ffee6398035dfab49b330b0fdee762f3830956b9f66351abc6b2a86bc', 'c1e0e3cf7085e75968a9cafc3726180a4160889560f9ad8f5e773d4925ba3c89']"

This week I’m participating virtually in STOC’2021, which today had a celebration of the 50th anniversary of NP-completeness (featuring Steve Cook, Richard Karp, Leonid Levin, Christos Papadimitriou, and Avi Wigderson), and which tomorrow will have a day’s worth of quantum computing content, including a tutorial on MIP*=RE, two quantum sessions, and an invited talk on quantum supremacy by John Martinis. I confess that I’m not a fan of GatherTown, the platform being used for STOC. Basically, you get a little avatar who wanders around a virtual hotel lobby and enters sessions—but it seems to reproduce all of the frustrating and annoying parts of experience without any of the good parts.
Ah! But I got the surprising news that Alex Arkhipov and I are among the winners of STOC’s first-ever “Test of Time Award,” for our paper on BosonSampling. It feels strange to win a “Test of Time” award for work that we did in 2011, which still seems like yesterday to me. All the more since the experimental status and prospects of quantum supremacy via BosonSampling are still very much live, unresolved questions.
Speaking of which: on Monday, Alexey Rubtsov, of the Skolkovo Institute in Moscow, gave a talk for our quantum information group meeting at UT, about his recent work with Popova on classically simulating Gaussian BosonSampling. From the talk, I learned something extremely important. I had imagined that their simulation must take advantage of the high rate of photon loss in actual experiments (like the USTC experiment from late 2020), because how else are you going to simulate BosonSampling efficiently? But Rubtsov explained that that’s not how it works at all. While their algorithm is heuristic and remains to be rigorously analyzed, numerical studies suggest that it works even with no photon losses or other errors. Having said that, their algorithm works:
- only for Gaussian BosonSampling, not Fock-state BosonSampling (as Arkhipov and I had originally proposed),
- only for threshold detectors, not photon-counting detectors, and
- only for a small number of modes (say, linear in the number of photons), not for a large number of modes (say, quadratic in the number of photons) as in the original proposal.
So, bottom line, it now looks like the USTC experiment, amazing engineering achievement though it was, is not hard to spoof with a classical computer. If so, this is because of multiple ways in which the experiment differed from my and Arkhipov’s original theoretical proposal. We know exactly what those ways are—indeed, you can find them in my earlier blog posts on the subject—and hopefully they can be addressed in future experiments. All in all, then, we’re left with a powerful demonstration of the continuing relevance of formal hardness reductions, and the danger of replacing them with intuitions and “well, it still seems hard to me.” So I hope the committee won’t rescind my and Arkhipov’s Test of Time Award based on these developments in the past couple weeks!",3035,"['0cfea8d44b89acaa883aa28d7e02362a17965e57874405e12b079ee144820807', '75cf419c5400c850a64df2c927abf649e2d89bcb7ba0894567779856abb756b8', 'a55b8814fb1b11c7c8b1fcfcaaf945c01312a61a4fa27d79a556bdc07fbee164', 'fb3d911a82fbac9b251fd2a9c0905ed76c424f5545419c35fd8cd8ce1ce78053', 'b87b877bd1ab892edef2057e6d414310d3644cb25f29170405f3a2048530fc45', '3a15e163b02ac3c33564972227463f2a449d04dc03570f6ec4697e262b02fb65', 'a568acb93e12edd6c0429b3028e31a2e77d3bd0d7fc110ac78b699968bef682c', '60db9780fdecdbfb050f90bfdb444e75a3a1b4ea1ce58e74a39cadde51f2c5ee', '78015dad24c2266370dd740ee1ef16866b44f6051af64fb56bc8d153a46c3034', '2cad87b00f4dbb1f75e96c8f98be0629a696833e2ae369dafc1f186a78845cbe', 'e109b72a681b3855e77633c09a4b0bc577b818f4f02032c43941b59b294967b5', '245a72db7c3fa16bbb347d9f924674cb1543ab56089cd535c3dc6d258cedcc44', 'f5dcaec71e9faa845495009e503c92d9336eff0252b3dc0e5500319811ce99d4', '2c0239b22880c479303be6d2d477c9a0663f86404f16ab96cf72536ac297448c', '6485055522c02467ce56165a617a2007951f7903c61187414ef2a8cae12601da', '1a041b314535297b77ab3c095fcc423e48cf5304eb64f4e206a4d197cf2c57f1', '0c11dd815bb8abb2de3be49f6e31daf78774ae959a4ef768664950e2c3dd4746', '036ff33c3fd5098988eba5fa3ed4b88f2e168370c1f7d0bb5fb638f339e95315', '6133a3bbd0a219a48aa9f7a12dbf8a53b3fb35497d2150a86f3124be70a80dd2', 'fd7530638192f688d040ecd507a48b1c5623f2ca21d769c375fd5c2d978981ca', '1a5dd9ac4159f264e965a9e216c490775a825b4013e19d5e1784e83895a50832', '8b1c256992a1446b15af342de4b51629076e04d9b0b1035898aa7bce25936a2f', 'bbf1b571af38ee003c74eaf6198392204861771c5b55da8111b11cbff2ab5314', 'e2d3c488b91f53dd9ce1a5d6ec053d3567e64e4288bab1e926328a6072325b58', '9515ce94f94361e1a2ebcb3f076597effcbbe4fed3194fe8f4fab9efdf6e78f5']"

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I found it hard to discuss that meta-level question, as Quanta‘s editors asked me to do, without also engaging in the object-level task of actually explaining QC. For regular Shtetl-Optimized readers, there will be nothing new here, but I’m happy with how the piece turned out.
Accompanying the Quanta piece is a 10-minute YouTube explainer on quantum computing, which (besides snazzy graphics) features interviews with me, John Preskill, and Dorit Aharonov.
On a different note, my colleague Mark Wilde has recorded a punk-rock song about BosonSampling. I can honestly report that it’s some of the finest boson-themed music I’ve heard in years. It includes the following lyrics:
Quantum computer, Ain’t no loser
Quantum computer, Quantum computer
People out on the streets
They don’t know what it is
They think it finds the cliques
Or finds graph colorings
But it don’t solve anything
Said it don’t solve anything
Bosonic slot machine
My lil’ photonic dream
Speaking of BosonSampling, A. S. Popova and A. N. Rubtsov, of the Skolkovo Institute in Moscow, have a new preprint entitled Cracking the Quantum Advantage threshold for Gaussian Boson Sampling. In it, they claim to give an efficient classical algorithm to simulate noisy GBS experiments, like the one six months ago from USTC in China. I’m still unsure how well this scales from 30-40 photons up to 50-70 photons; which imperfections of the USTC experiment are primarily being taken advantage of (photon losses?); and how this relates to the earlier proposed classical algorithms for simulating noisy BosonSampling, like the one by Kalai and Kindler. Anyone with any insight is welcome to share!

43,5517,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5517,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-05-24,Scott Aaronson,In which I answer more quantum computing questions,"Yesterday, I had fun doing an open-ended Q&A at the Astral Codex Ten weekly online meetup. See here for the YouTube video. The questions were mainly about quantum computing, but ranged over various other topics as well, including education policy, the Great Stagnation, and what my biggest disagreements with Scott Alexander are.
In other news, last week I gave my talk about quantum supremacy at the (virtual, of course) Quantum Science Seminar, organized by Sebastian Blatt and others. See here for the YouTube video. Since I (alas) needed to leave after an hour sharp, the organizers asked if they could send me additional questions in writing and have me answer them. I said sure, as long as I could also post the Q&A on this blog! So without further ado…
Q: As you said, in computer science it’s difficult to prove that things are hard. From a computer science perspective, to what extent is “quantum supremacy” something absolute, and to what extent is it a shifting bar that depends on how good our classical hardware and algorithms are?
SCOTT: It’s kind of like the question “can computers beat the best humans at chess?” The latter question also involves a non-absolute shifting bar – maybe humans are getting better! Or maybe they simply haven’t figured out how to beat the computers yet! So how can we say “computer supremacy” has been decisively achieved? Nevertheless, one can clearly see a phase transition, with Deep Blue in 1996-1997, where the burden of proof shifted massively from one side to the other, and has stayed there ever since. Even if humans are getting better, the computers have also gotten better, and at such an insane rate that humans seem to have no chance of ever again catching up.
From a theoretical standpoint, that’s exactly what we might expect to happen with quantum supremacy experiments – simply because they involve tasks that have polynomial scaling for quantum computers, but (as far as we know) exponential scaling for classical computers, where each additional qubit roughly doubles the classical resources required. In analyzing concrete quantum supremacy experiments, I’d say that the goal is not to pin down the exact factor by which they’re beating this or that classical simulation (the answers will change rapidly anyway, and depend on all sorts of low-level details), but simply to figure out whether or not we’ve entered that phase transition.
Q: What do you generally think about improvements in tensor network methods as a challenge to quantum supremacy and the recent simulation of the supremacy result in Beijing?
SCOTT: I blogged about this here. It was a clever paper, which showed that if you focus narrowly on spoofing the linear cross-entropy benchmark used by Google, then there’s a classical algorithm to do that much faster than had been previously pointed out, by generating many samples that all share most of their bits in common (e.g., that all agree on the first 30 of the 53 bits). But many people remain unaware that, if you just changed the benchmark – for example, if you insisted that the returned samples not only pass the linear cross-entropy benchmark, but also be sufficiently different – then this classical spoofing strategy wouldn’t work and we’d be back to the previous status quo.
Q: Why do you need a random circuit to test the device, and also why is this more interesting/useful than doing something very specific many times to test the device?
SCOTT: The reasons to use random quantum circuits are simply that
(1) they generate complicated entangled states on all the qubits nearly as rapidly as it’s possible to do so – indeed, we now have theoretical results that give a detailed understanding of this process, and
(2) random circuits seem to have about as little “usable structure” (which a classical simulation might exploit) as it’s possible to have.
Eventually, of course, we’d like to run actually useful circuits (say, those that arise in Shor’s factoring algorithm), which will typically have regular patterns and be extremely far from random! But then more qubits will be needed to get an advantage over classical computers. It’s not terribly surprising for the first advantage over classical to be via random quantum circuits, which in some sense “maximally exploit” the hardware resources available.
Q: Have you heard of/what do you think about the recent NP-verification experiment using a quantum optical setup from Paris?
SCOTT: That experiment was actually based on a protocol that Beigi, Fefferman, Drucker, Shor, and I proposed back in 2008. It’s crucial for people to understand that there’s no claimed speedup here for solving any NP-complete problem. We’re talking about a more arcane task: namely, proving to someone that an NP-complete problem has a solution by sending them a small number of qubits. Even there, the protocol depends on the ability to send two quantum states that are guaranteed not to be entangled with each other; also, the communication savings is “only” polynomial rather than exponential (in our original protocol, roughly √n qubits where n classical bits would have been needed). Nevertheless, it’s always fun to see a real experiment implementing some version of something that you worked out on paper, even if you already knew it would work!
Q: If the difficulty for classical simulation is related to the Hilbert space dimension, has it been formally proven that an ideal analog classical computer cannot outperform a quantum computer?
SCOTT: This is not a question of “formal proof” but of physics. In my view, we already know deep reasons why, in our universe, analog classical computers are unlikely to be able to do anything that can’t be efficiently simulated using a standard digital computer. (In other words, why analog classical computers don’t violate the “Extended Church-Turing Thesis.”) Those reasons have to do with nonlinear dynamics chaotically amplifying even the tiniest errors in an analog device. Or, if you really want to push this discussion to the bitter end, they have to do with the breakdown in our picture of a smooth spacetime that’s expected to occur at the Planck scale, of ~10-33 centimeters and ~10-43 seconds, for reasons of black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity. Crucially, neither of these issues apply to quantum computation. The former doesn’t apply because of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, which have the effect of “discretizing” continuous errors; while the latter doesn’t apply because as far as anyone knows today, quantum mechanics (unlike theories that assume a smooth spacetime) is exactly true.
Q: [In the comparison between quantum and classical computation], what do we mean by “classical resources” here? Do we mean something parochial like “resources obeying non-quantum laws that are available to us humans on Earth?” Or is any classical resource fair game, no matter its size and classical equations of motion? In that case, doesn’t demonstrating quantum supremacy require demonstrating that the quantum computer exceeds the capabilities of, say, a classical computer the size of the solar system that exploits some CTC (closed timelike curve)?
SCOTT: If CTCs were possible, that would be a revolution in physics even greater than quantum mechanics! Leaving CTCs aside, though, cosmology and quantum gravity seem to impose a limit of roughly 10122 on the number of bits (and the number of operations on the bits) that any computer that fit inside the observable universe could possibly have. And if you envision that cosmological computer as a classical one, then it shouldn’t take impossibly long for us to build quantum computers that can outperform it on some tasks: indeed, a device with ~400 qubits should already be enough! But of course we’re not there yet: with 50-60 qubits, QCs right now are “merely” challenging the largest classical computers currently available on earth (again, on contrived sampling tasks), rather than the largest that could fit in the observable universe.
Q: Why is a quantum state (superposition or entangled state) inherently more fragile than a classical state?
SCOTT: Because when information from the state (say, whether a qubit is 0 or 1, or which path a photon takes through a beamsplitter network) “leaks out” into the environment, the information effectively becomes entangled with the environment, which damages the state in a measurable way. Indeed, it now appears to an observer as a mixed state rather than a pure state, so that interference between the different components can no longer happen. This is a fundamental, justly-famous feature of quantum information that’s not shared by classical information.
Q: Given that we have noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices, what do you see as the fundamental role of noise in the discussion on quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. Is it simply a question of less noise is better, or are there things that cannot be done if there is noise?
SCOTT: There will always be some noise. The big question, about any given platform, is whether the noise is low enough that you can start usefully error-correcting it away, or whether the noise is so high that there’s no point (i.e., whether you’re above or below the “fault-tolerance threshold”). Until you start doing error-correction, most experts believe there’s a severe limit to how far you can scale: probably to quantum computations involving a few hundred qubits at most. Whereas once you have error-correction, at least in principle the sky’s the limit.
Q: You used the Wright brothers as an example where an airplane that was not practically useful itself pioneered the path to useful flight. In what sense to the sampling experiments of Google and USTC also pioneer that path for what we need for the future of quantum computing, or to what extent do you see them as niche examples of quantum supremacy?
SCOTT: I think the majority of what Google did, in integrating 53 superconducting qubits, making them programmable, etc. – and especially in characterizing the noise in a system at that scale – will be directly useful going forward. Indeed, that’s a large part of why they did it! Likewise, a lot of what USTC did, in integrating hundreds of beamsplitters, photon sources, and photodetectors, could be directly relevant to building a universal optical quantum computer. On the other hand, it’s true that both groups took shortcuts with the immediate goal of quantum supremacy in mind. As an example, Google’s chip uses a particular 2-qubit gate that was chosen, not because it shows up naturally in any application, but simply because it’s extra-hard to simulate using tensor network contraction algorithms, so it let them get to quantum supremacy faster than if they’d used a more conventional 2-qubit gate like the CNOT.
Q: To what extent does the measured circuit fidelity of 0.2% in the Google experiment limit the usability of this system for other computations?
SCOTT: Oh, we don’t know of anything particularly useful to do with Google’s Sycamore chip – that is, anything that you couldn’t do much more easily without it – other than
(1) quantum supremacy demonstrations,
(2) possibly the generation of cryptographically certified random bits, and
(3) of course, calibration experiments that tell you about the behavior of integrated superconducting qubits and thereby help you iterate to the next device.
But things are developing rapidly – the best circuit fidelity that was achievable in 2019 is not necessarily the best now, or the best that will be achieved in another year or two.
Update (May 25): Please, no new questions; just discussion of the existing questions and answers! I had hoped to get some work done today; I hadn’t planned on another ask-me-anything session.

44,5460,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5460,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-04-20,Scott Aaronson,Doubts about teapot supremacy: my reply to Richard Borcherds,"Richard Borcherds is a British mathematician at Berkeley, who won the 1998 Fields Medal for the proof of the monstrous moonshine conjecture among many other contributions. A couple months ago, Borcherds posted on YouTube a self-described “rant” about quantum computing, which was recently making the rounds on Facebook and which I found highly entertaining.
Borcherds points out that the term “quantum supremacy” means only that quantum computers can outperform existing classical computers on some benchmark, which can be chosen to show maximum advantage for the quantum computer. He allows that BosonSampling could have some value, for example in calibrating quantum computers or in comparing one quantum computer to another, but he decries the popular conflation of quantum supremacy with the actual construction of a scalable quantum computer able (for example) to run Shor’s algorithm to break RSA.
Borcherds also proposes a “teapot test,” according to which any claim about quantum computers can be dismissed if an analogous claim would hold for a teapot (which he brandishes for the camera). For example, there are many claims to solve practical optimization and machine learning problems by “quantum/classical hybrid algorithms,” wherein a classical computer does most of the work but a quantum computer is somehow involved. Borcherds points out that, at least as things stand in early 2021, in most or all such cases, the classical computer could’ve probably done as well entirely on its own. So then if you put a teapot on top of your classical computer while it ran, you could equally say you used a “classical/teapot hybrid approach.”
Needless to say, Borcherds is correct about all of this. I’ve made similar points on this blog for 15 years, although less Britishly. I’m delighted to have such serious new firepower on the scoffing-at-QC-hype team.
I do, however, have one substantive disagreement. At one point, Borcherds argues that sampling-based quantum supremacy itself fails his teapot test. For consider the computational problem of predicting how many pieces a teapot will break into if it’s dropped on the ground. Clearly, he says, the teapot itself will outperform any simulation running on any existing classical computer at that task, and will therefore achieve “teapot supremacy.” But who cares??
I’m glad that Borcherds has set out, rather crisply, an objection that’s been put to me many times over the past decade. The response is simple: I don’t believe the teapot really does achieve teapot supremacy on the stated task! At the least, I’d need to be shown why. You can’t just assert it without serious argument.
If we want to mirror the existing quantum supremacy experiments, then the teapot computational problem, properly formulated, should be: given as input a description of a teapot’s construction, the height from which it’s dropped, etc., output a sample from the probability distribution over the number of shards that the teapot will break into when it hits the floor.
If so, though, then clearly a classical computer can easily sample from the same distribution! Why? Because presumably we agree that there’s a negligible probability of more than (say) 1000 shards. So the distribution is characterized by a list of at most 1000 probabilities, which can be estimated empirically (at the cost of a small warehouse of smashed teapots) and thereafter used to generate samples. In the plausible event that the distribution is (say) a Gaussian, it’s even easier: just estimate the mean and variance.
A couple days ago, I was curious what the distribution looked like, so I decided to order some teapots from Amazon and check. Unfortunately, real porcelain teapots are expensive, and it seemed vaguely horrific to order dozens (as would be needed to get reasonable data) for the sole purpose of smashing them on my driveway. So I hit on what seemed like a perfect solution: I ordered toy teapots, which were much smaller and cheaper. Alas, when my toy “porcelain” teapots arrived yesterday, they turned out (unsurprisingly in retrospect for a children’s toy) to be some sort of plastic or composite material, meaning that they didn’t break unless one propelled them downward forcefully. So, while I can report that they tended to break into one or two large pieces along with two or three smaller shards, I found it impossible to get better data. (There’s a reason why I became a theoretical computer scientist…)
The good news is that my 4-year-old son had an absolute blast smashing toy teapots with me on our driveway, while my 8-year-old daughter was thrilled to take the remaining, unbroken teapots for her dollhouse. I apologize if this fails to defy gender stereotypes.
Anyway, it might be retorted that it’s not good enough to sample from a probability distribution: what’s wanted, rather, is to calculate how many pieces this specific teapot will break into, given all the microscopic details of it and its environment. Aha, this brings us to a crucial conceptual point: in order for something to count as an “input” to a computer, you need to be able to set it freely. Certainly, at the least, you need to be able to measure and record the input in its entirety, so that someone trying to reproduce your computation on a standard silicon computer would know exactly which computation to do. You don’t get to claim computational supremacy based on a problem with secret inputs: that’s like failing someone on a math test without having fully told them the problems.
Ability to set and know the inputs is the key property that’s satisfied by Google’s quantum supremacy experiment, and to a lesser extent by the USTC BosonSampling experiment, but that’s not satisfied at all by the “smash a teapot on the floor” experiment. Or perhaps it’s better to say: influences on a computation that vary uncontrollably and chaotically, like gusts of air hitting the teapot as it falls to the floor, shouldn’t be called “inputs” at all; they’re simply noise sources. And what one does with noise sources is to try to estimate their distribution and average over them—but in that case, as I said, there’s no teapot supremacy.
A Facebook friend said to me: that’s well and good, but surely we could change Borcherds’s teapot experiment to address this worry? For example: add a computer-controlled lathe (or even a 3D printer), with which you can build a teapot in an arbitrary shape of your choice. Then consider the problem of sampling from the probability distribution over how many pieces that teapot will smash into, when it’s dropped from some standard height onto some standard surface. I replied that this is indeed more interesting—in fact, it already seems more like what engineers do in practice (still, sometimes!) when building wind tunnels, than like a silly reductio ad absurdum of quantum supremacy experiments. On the other hand, if you believe the Extended Church-Turing Thesis, then as long as your analog computer is governed by classical physics, it’s presumably inherently limited to an Avogadro’s number type speedup over a standard digital computer, whereas with a quantum computer, you’re limited only by the exponential dimensionality of Hilbert space, which seems more interesting.
Or maybe I’m wrong—in which case, I look forward to the first practical demonstration of teapot supremacy! Just like with quantum supremacy, though, it’s not enough to assert it; you need to … put the tea where your mouth is.
Update: On the suggestion of Ernest Davis, who I can now reveal as the Facebook friend mentioned above, I just ordered some terra cotta flower pots, which look cheap, easily smashable, and environmentally friendly, and which will hopefully be acceptable substitutes for porcelain teapots in a new experiment. (Not that my main arguments in this post hinge on the results of such an experiment! That’s the power of theory.)
Another Update: Some of you might enjoy John Horgan’s Scientific American column on reality vs. hype in quantum computing, based on conversations with me and with Terry Rudolph of PsiQuantum.",8078,"['1f280b565c018eb647da72a4dbceba861b17ce1055cb3aee8876ca50077c9004', '1c479b792a92f8a95710839826b617a161770a7edce8333efafa0b1a762d5c01', '05847ce40d4ad43e3075a8ad7d44cf1faa3b8ca8ffe459fbfb79ef60abbac33f', 'ff9a0f9a918111af4aeb79ac056150ee03a945a91fad0865028dbd22deabf8aa', '821d61add193a7f65dfb47348f08cd5110ebd1ec0e7ef8f7d940bea38976e25e', 'c9e6d9645b761058e337d2dfe8a7e877e577ec1c0d61385490323e18edcdf651', '5e6a0ad4886c35cf3a2ebb78a8d8807d0b2c7adff91f420e5f9eb5f8c9cdc3c0', '517add2d2b5fbb189e0007e535fdfe73f71654d04d0a4a4645a6ff76db46a8ae', 'c94873ddf5ab390497e70dd3164e9711441bb0715021de94e8d510ebf62b01e8', '832ce76b54ad6fbff7a969139bfcf8e9c0fc70e51dcf92334036a0bdc882c8d2', '8b6fd54aea7791722585144053a645a650be83745a43c4d402d8d8f0a832dabe', '1eae34738aa1f6445eaa0f65dd535a27e49ad84fa993813146089dda6490b54e', '5391d6a2729d45adac3cbbf882786bd6df27dfdafe50f8d269ace5598e1c57ae', 'ae0607c6ba47dd59fcba2f9a501b020d5720c797410c6b098f286aa637e2cdc2', '839da3bea220e144aa83052e44a858c49bb307fc493732cabab21a62a39fcca6', 'dd5bb686b8fe6a4c3ff4bf6af5fdac6b30a1c7680e5228f0d244709ec5aaa379', '7dae493163a5f72aada82cfb9f3b4b3972d313d4da0b81a2ad38f94ee7729709', '879ffc8f4a929c2f61240eebf5c48a96c34425ef44451fa2a68faf4440d6bab8', '1aa410e2cd99060885d689aeed5af12b4566164b8935b3088d90229bd8944989', '17d6b13468a99a41940af1cfeb85b5f86450c129074aa24210f3677a8973e043', '2270a685d08475eda500579f13706156d5c90863b0f4016ed9c22b9910424c3c', '5e948cc946fbb2120425f424ce74031e5e71c4e19c5dbc3a3ddc49dc421c631d', 'ac1481d593cc05968eccccc7cfd96c469734d422cdf4b9214b324ea864a859de', 'b52ebf2c2bbb3bdd5396ef8f9f44577dfcd04d8beb4cec648addbf1a4c0fa4c0', '924cd33ddef831bceee83811f6a3d618112b586283f033f859a423f83c5d9ed1', '3d20165b915102fe9863c80718aaade0ec5f894f2b318b7a0633e759900c0439', 'b96b69225bcf0725b2af0cec1ad695e028438688a0ab03cae5dff8ca38b18757', '3f5495be2b4afdf8b2927ea53815d0a638728dcfcec2ab82f600c9dd38de9456', '4fbc320f73064d07feb508bd22ce51e1388bf6bf6a28612eb91aa047aab86142', 'b8ba32604656b96688d1b2112e196d17609d5aa7e09086c83b4498b43f1f3b37', 'dd7fbe18779446526b739603ff8bf97933b38db5ede0af501e7699f27bd63c02', 'c5196c474b6e93dff2022dca84acbd8ede9ba9950293869ebd9ae7c0f5168ec7', '2946af56a05e0e7d0ddf13c81d92f6980b1e7c4c1daad6a2b14b57bf4729e09e', 'afff56e7d63ca714f242ff42fc4f7c07af0eadaa2a20121568032c378048e1db', '53d16f43c20212f3e94f335144eb9e5404a994770580e6183dbc346b2c58e5d7', '5a498e808d7dbf022828a091d4696ca1ecfcd2a4152be2efa4250c1ca6a3d821', '697c156d7f760601a2569c4a320477feb5957b2eded120a5651b06d95cb00e98', '7a998b4d16bc9ec48ca67d04b446376b23f827e694ae70639479fd97ae6420ad', 'c004743f358150182251083dc052b8fac3bc91d4d91d80502811492c865bbbbf', 'dce2ff17d74ef826b2a930439164a36005d662f79c632394b9ae9085e9befdba', '7667c7d48e687211ac11d6680da4c22649de0bfc268bd5047bbb2d522607712d', '8fe4ee2a421186fd419dfd142b7182d3cb0221b04b4163dfb44a567ec96d924e', 'f9035903e1ecb84665eba955a51ae1992e6b8b1912504d888c481f0ff56b5db9', 'f20109f0946faecbaeedfe6dd3311960960ba70ae3aa6a31c25edf790da0ce45', 'fea7bddc47a67c96f913065778b09ec6f263b6d854028fdeba114ac754e799a1', 'c28ecf9dfd5917d7649ed7327e9a406b804535c35c88f908bcb3cbbc82fd69f7', 'd808ebcaccc74004f6d716406436fdb937c43536847f58e51139eb064de66130', 'd43aafe4aa2f6b7e3854e5abbc9c821d908a478f4803d13cccca6c3ae327e812', '71851aabc40c63212cc79bdaf20f08a98021a86c8c9c9977da945293178f4b75', 'ba3b5bbb49ca544ea6cfc1cf1c8820e93efe80c609a86b377d064618542d0f45', 'd1d338b43c75d5d29835648e44a3b5557e02b34e7c9561f203dd2aabc5816d4a', '02978b96cf2592080de64fbc1e2553309f6346f9373e05d5249479cdbee595ff', 'c53a11f85c4735c5d2a1c38de44a4f55bdd9a4bfc7741f098836da6706960785', '92a4613194ece1a374c4a4bf9403eed9b725c0cdc0255840668d7b452fcd4012', 'ff299927f72a59ae4b14ed6521ddfbd014e92810e6a3db92ab540028a81c36ba', 'e4d2c8c037bddd4968d1fc3978d66d95cf249edfd0bea99d1a77a2a7b086728d', 'a29b7dd90711fc14bdb2883d97c2e56b1fed69f69c27c061e2bea2789146282d', '7851ecce592b3360a0289af94993da1e351b73fb9b2c3d4b94fc797ba47e158c', 'dbcdca2e86bf24726e7ab3a4c3dce10e09fcbec9e58b1b8fa00049f80e30a670', 'b0891cca22c29d2b21384fa79f39f3ac8edcb3528d8741d1e349668abf5de73a', '2738427b8e134dea2d4ce7951e78a0549c64a68bd860b6df9768937eb9ad0f0f', 'c3d73b99a4aa741e92989f31c9cede7d609631e77f0cd3f3e0a770645c92b201', 'fe90dbc8aee466b21a8b7a37d6820df497cfa207b5279f452b35c56b7f3f19e3', '11b6e1b7b4446e139948f441e433cdce1286797bf679a2033e206051559df12b', '7ad83ee3dd9b4f49a39674c4053bc3993638d351723fbc3c328fa77e0c3f771d', 'adca3705ee65a40f1704441feb20842ef39e472596469cb5d0d8a00726ac6b6c', '0b4e0e73da0dbd53209a82ce0ca6619c240e93d5d943db118ad7a07c0808f2d7', '3b94f06a7062b0a001276e44750532bec7696076c3009d8e7516766a34bdd11e', 'cf15dc2e9d5be2962099a39a4b38b86bcd628f9c0da4bb88b43e0c7b8923c2a5', 'c75fbd090c7deaa32e28efcc9f09d10f5726d0b7bb66a32d225b17e1dcb895e4']"
45,5448,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5448,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-04-14,Scott Aaronson,The ACM Prize thing,"Last week I got an email from Dina Katabi, my former MIT colleague, asking me to call her urgently. Am I in trouble? For what, though?? I haven’t even worked at MIT for five years!
Luckily, Dina only wanted to tell me that I’d been selected to receive the 2020 ACM Prize in Computing, a mid-career award founded in 2007 that comes with $250,000 from Infosys. Not the Turing Award but I’d happily take it! And I could even look back on 2020 fondly for something.
I was utterly humbled to see the list of past ACM Prize recipients, which includes amazing computer scientists I’ve been privileged to know and learn from (like Jon Kleinberg, Sanjeev Arora, and Dan Boneh) and others who I’ve admired from afar (like Daphne Koller, Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat of Google MapReduce, and David Silver of AlphaGo and AlphaZero).
I was even more humbled, later, to read my prize citation, which focuses on four things:
- The theoretical foundations of the sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments now being carried out (and in particular, my and Alex Arkhipov’s 2011 paper on BosonSampling);
- My and Avi Wigderson’s 2008 paper on the algebrization barrier in complexity theory;
- Work on the limitations of quantum computers (in particular, the 2002 quantum lower bound for the collision problem); and
- Public outreach about quantum computing, including through QCSD, popular talks and articles, and this blog.
I don’t know if I’m worthy of such a prize—but I know that if I am, then it’s mainly for work I did between roughly 2001 and 2012. This honor inspires me to want to be more like I was back then, when I was driven, non-jaded, and obsessed with figuring out the contours of BQP and efficient computation in the physical universe. It makes me want to justify the ACM’s faith in me.
I’m grateful to the committee and nominators, and more broadly, to the whole quantum computing and theoretical computer science communities—which I “joined” in some sense around age 16, and which were the first communities where I ever felt like I belonged. I’m grateful to the mentors who made me what I am, especially Chris Lynch, Bart Selman, Lov Grover, Umesh Vazirani, Avi Wigderson, and (if he’ll allow me to include him) John Preskill. I’m grateful to the slightly older quantum computer scientists who I looked up to and tried to emulate, like Dorit Aharonov, Andris Ambainis, Ronald de Wolf, and John Watrous. I’m grateful to my wonderful colleagues at UT Austin, in the CS department and beyond. I’m grateful to my students and postdocs, the pride of my professional life. I’m grateful, of course, to my wife, parents, and kids.
By coincidence, my last post was also about prizes to theoretical computer scientists—in that case, two prizes that attracted controversy because of the recipient’s (or would-be recipient’s) political actions or views. It would understate matters to point out that not everyone has always agreed with everything I’ve said on this blog. I’m ridiculously lucky, and I know it, that even living through this polarized and tumultuous era, I never felt forced to choose between academic success and the freedom to speak my conscience in public under my real name. If there’s been one constant in my public stands, I’d like to think that—inspired by memories of my own years as an unknown, awkward, self-conscious teenager—it’s been my determination to nurture and protect talented young scientists, whatever they look like and wherever they come from. And I’ve tried to live up to that ideal in real life, and I welcome anyone’s scrutiny as to how well I’ve done.
What should I do with the prize money? I confess that my first instinct was to donate it, in its entirety, to some suitable charity—specifically, something that would make all the strangers who’ve attacked me on Twitter, Reddit, and so forth over the years realize that I’m fundamentally a good person. But I was talked out of this plan by my family, who pointed out that
(1) in all likelihood, nothing will make online strangers stop hating me,
(2) in any case this seems like a poor basis for making decisions, and
(3) if I really want to give others a say in what to do with the winnings, then why not everyone who’s stood by me and supported me?
So, beloved commenters! Please mention your favorite charitable causes below, especially weird ones that I wouldn’t have heard of otherwise. If I support their values, I’ll make a small donation from my prize winnings. Or a larger donation, especially if you donate yourself and challenge me to match. Whatever’s left after I get tired of donating will probably go to my kids’ college fund.
Update: And by an amusing coincidence, today is apparently “World Quantum Day”! I hope your Quantum Day is as pleasant as mine (and stable and coherent).",4780,"['c50d0d6162c79db18f2b5044a7bcc80f359fe1e9fbc88dae41c9f8dc53c2d6eb',

46,5387,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5387,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-03-21,Scott Aaronson,QC ethics and hype: the call is coming from inside the house,"For years, I’d sometimes hear discussions about the ethics of quantum computing research. Quantum ethics!
When the debates weren’t purely semantic, over the propriety of terms like “quantum supremacy” or “ancilla qubit,” they were always about chin-strokers like “but what if cracking RSA encryption gives governments more power to surveil their citizens? or what if only a few big countries or companies get quantum computers, thereby widening the divide between haves and have-nots?” Which, OK, conceivably these will someday be issues. But, besides barely depending on any specific facts about quantum computing, these debates always struck me as oddly safe, because the moral dilemmas were so hypothetical and far removed from us in time.
I confess I may have even occasionally poked fun when asked to expound on quantum ethics. I may have commented that quantum computers probably won’t kill anyone unless a dilution refrigerator tips over onto their head. I may have asked forgiveness for feeding custom-designed oracles to BQP and QMA, without first consulting an ethics committee about the long-term effects on those complexity classes.
Now fate has punished me for my flippancy. These days, I really do feel like quantum computing research has become an ethical minefield—but not for any of the reasons mentioned previously. What’s new is that millions of dollars are now potentially available to quantum computing researchers, along with equity, stock options, and whatever else causes “ka-ching” sound effects and bulging eyes with dollar signs. And in many cases, to have a shot at such riches, all an expert needs to do is profess optimism that quantum computing will have revolutionary, world-changing applications and have them soon. Or at least, not object too strongly when others say that.
Some of today’s rhetoric will of course remind people of the D-Wave saga, which first brought this blog to prominence when it began in earnest in 2007. Quantum computers, we hear now as then, will soon leave the Earth’s fastest supercomputers in the dust. They’re going to harness superposition to try all the exponentially many possible solutions at once. They’ll crack the Traveling Salesman Problem, and will transform machine learning and AI beyond recognition. Meanwhile, simulations of quantum systems will be key to solving global warming and cancer.
Despite the parallels, though, this new gold rush doesn’t feel to me like the D-Wave one, which seems in retrospect like just a little dry run. If I had to articulate what’s new in one sentence, it’s that this time “the call is coming from inside the house.” Many of the companies making wildly overhyped claims are recognized leaders of the field. They have brilliant quantum computing theorists and experimentalists on their staff with impeccable research records. Some of those researchers are among my best friends. And even when I wince at the claims of near-term applications, in many cases (especially with quantum simulation) the claims aren’t obviously false—we won’t know for certain until we try it and see! It’s genuinely gotten harder to draw the line between defensible optimism and exaggerations verging on fraud.
Indeed, this time around virtually everyone in QC is “complicit” to a greater or lesser degree. I, too, have accepted compensation to consult on quantum computing topics, to give talks at hedge funds, and in a few cases to serve as a scientific adviser to quantum computing startups. I tell myself that, by 2021 standards, this stuff is all trivial chump change—a few thousands of dollars here or there, to expound on the same themes that I already discuss free of charge on this blog. I actually get paid to dispel hype, rather than propagate it! I tell myself that I’ve turned my back on the orders of magnitude more money available to those willing to hitch their scientific reputations to the aspirations of this or that specific QC company. (Yes, this blog, and my desire to preserve its intellectual independence and credibility, might well be costing me millions!)
But, OK, some would argue that accepting any money from QC companies or QC investors just puts you at the top of a slope with unabashed snake-oil salesmen at the bottom. With the commercialization of our field that started around 2015, there’s no bright line anymore marking the boundary between pure scientific curiosity and the pursuit of filthy lucre; it’s all just points along a continuum. I’m not sure that these people are wrong.
As some of you might’ve seen already, IonQ, the trapped-ion QC startup that originated from the University of Maryland, is poised to have the first-ever quantum computing IPO—a so-called “SPAC IPO,” which while I’m a financial ignoramus, apparently involves merging with a shell company and thereby bypassing the SEC’s normal IPO rules. Supposedly they’re seeking $650 million in new funding and a $2 billion market cap. If you want to see what IonQ is saying about QC to prospective investors, click here. Lacking any choice in the matter, I’ll probably say more about these developments in a future post.
Meanwhile, PsiQuantum, the Palo-Alto-based optical QC startup, has said that it’s soon going to leave “stealth mode.” And Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Honeywell, and other big players continue making large investments in QC—treating it, at least rhetorically, not at all like blue-sky basic research, but like a central part of their future business plans.
All of these companies have produced or funded excellent QC research. And of course, they’re all heterogeneous, composed of individuals who might vehemently disagree with each other about the near- or long-term prospects of QC. And yet all of them have, at various times, inspired reflections in me like the ones in this post.
I regret that this post has no clear conclusion. I’m still hashing things out, solicing thoughts from my readers and friends. Speaking of which: this coming Monday, March 22, at 8-10pm US Eastern time, I’ve decided to hold a discussion around these issues on Clubhouse—my “grand debut” on that app, and an opportunity to see whether I like it or not! My friend Adam Brown will moderate the discussion; other likely participants will be John Horgan, George Musser, Michael Nielsen, and Matjaž Leonardis. If you’re on Clubhouse, I hope to see you there!

I was incredibly proud that, each time I taught, at least some of the projects led to publishable original research—sometimes highly significant research, like Paul Christiano’s work on quantum money (which led to my later paper with him), Shelby Kimmel’s work on quantum query complexity, Jenny Barry’s work on quantum partially observable Markov decision processes (“QOMDPs”), or Matt Coudron and Henry Yuen’s work on randomness expansion (which led to their later breakthrough in the subject).
Alas, after I moved to UT Austin, for some reason I discontinued the tradition of these blog-showcases—and inexcusably, I did this even though the wonderful new research results continued! Now that I’m teaching Quantum Complexity Theory at UT for the third time (via Zoom, of course), I decided that it was finally time to remedy this. To keep things manageable, this time I’m going to limit myself to research projects that began their lives in my course and that are already public on the arXiv (or in one case, that will soon be).
So please enjoy the following smorgasbord, from 2016 and 2019 iterations of my course! And if you have any questions about any of the projects—well, I’ll try to get the students to answer in the comments section! Thanks so much and congratulations to the students for their work.
From the Fall 2016 iteration of the course
William Hoza (project turned into a joint paper with Cole Graham), Universal Bell Correlations Do Not Exist.
We prove that there is no finite-alphabet nonlocal box that generates exactly those correlations that can be generated using a maximally entangled pair of qubits. More generally, we prove that if some finite-alphabet nonlocal box is strong enough to simulate arbitrary local projective measurements of a maximally entangled pair of qubits, then that nonlocal box cannot itself be simulated using any finite amount of entanglement. We also give a quantitative version of this theorem for approximate simulations, along with a corresponding upper bound.
Many proposals for fault-tolerant quantum computation require injection of ‘magic states’ to achieve a universal set of operations. Some qubit states are above a threshold fidelity, allowing them to be converted into magic states via ‘magic state distillation’, a process based on stabilizer codes from quantum error correction.
We define quantum weight enumerators that take into account the sign of the stabilizer operators. These enumerators completely describe the magic state distillation behavior when distilling T-type magic states. While it is straightforward to calculate them directly by counting exponentially many operator weights, it is also an NP-hard problem to compute them in general. This suggests that finding a family of distillation schemes with desired threshold properties is at least as hard as finding the weight distributions of a family of classical codes.
Additionally, we develop search algorithms fast enough to analyze all useful 5 qubit codes and some 7 qubit codes, finding no codes that surpass the best known threshold.
From the Spring 2019 iteration of the course
Ying-Hao Chen, 2-Local Hamiltonian with Low Complexity is QCMA-complete.
We prove that 2-Local Hamiltonian (2-LH) with Low Complexity problem is QCMA-complete by combining the results from the QMA-completeness of 2-LH and QCMA-completeness of 3-LH with Low Complexity. The idea is straightforward. It has been known that 2-LH is QMA-complete. By putting a low complexity constraint on the input state, we make the problem QCMA. Finally, we use similar arguments as in [Kempe, Kitaev, Regev] to show that all QCMA problems can be reduced to our proposed problem.
Quantum walk algorithms can speed up search of physical regions of space in both the discrete-time [arXiv:quant-ph/0402107] and continuous-time setting [arXiv:quant-ph/0306054], where the physical region of space being searched is modeled as a connected graph. In such a model, Aaronson and Ambainis [arXiv:quant-ph/0303041] provide three different criteria for a unitary matrix to act locally with respect to a graph, called Z-local, C-local, and H-local unitaries, and left the open question of relating these three locality criteria. Using a correspondence between continuous- and discrete-time quantum walks by Childs [arXiv:0810.0312], we provide a way to approximate N×N H-local unitaries with error δ using O(1/√δ,√N) C-local unitaries, where the comma denotes the maximum of the two terms.
Joshua A. Cook, Approximating Unitary Preparations of Orthogonal Black Box States.
In this paper, I take a step toward answering the following question: for m different small circuits that compute m orthogonal n qubit states, is there a small circuit that will map m computational basis states to these m states without any input leaving any auxiliary bits changed. While this may seem simple, the constraint that auxiliary bits always be returned to 0 on any input (even ones besides the m we care about) led me to use sophisticated techniques. I give an approximation of such a unitary in the m = 2 case that has size polynomial in the approximation error, and the number of qubits n.
Sabee Grewal (project turned into a joint paper with me), Efficient Learning of Non-Interacting Fermion Distributions.
We give an efficient classical algorithm that recovers the distribution of a non-interacting fermion state over the computational basis. For a system of n non-interacting fermions and m modes, we show that O(m2n4log(m/δ)/ε4) samples and O(m4n4log(m/δ)/ε4) time are sufficient to learn the original distribution to total variation distance ε with probability 1−δ. Our algorithm empirically estimates the one- and two-mode correlations and uses them to reconstruct a succinct description of the entire distribution efficiently.
Sam Gunn and Niels Kornerup, Review of a Quantum Algorithm for Betti Numbers.
We looked into the algorithm for calculating Betti numbers presented by Lloyd, Garnerone, and Zanardi (LGZ). We present a new algorithm in the same spirit as LGZ with the intent of clarifying quantum algorithms for computing Betti numbers. Our algorithm is simpler and slightly more efficient than that presented by LGZ. We present a thorough analysis of our algorithm, pointing out reasons that both our algorithm and that presented by LGZ do not run in polynomial time for most inputs. However, the algorithms do run in polynomial time for calculating an approximation of the Betti number to polynomial multiplicative error, when applied to some class of graphs for which the Betti number is exponentially large.
William Kretschmer, Lower Bounding the AND-OR Tree via Symmetrization.
We prove a simple, nearly tight lower bound on the approximate degree of the two-level AND-OR tree using symmetrization arguments. Specifically, we show that ~deg(ANDm∘ORn)=Ω(~√(mn)). To our knowledge, this is the first proof of this fact that relies on symmetrization exclusively; most other proofs involve the more complicated formulation of approximate degree as a linear program [BT13, She13, BDBGK18]. Our proof also demonstrates the power of a symmetrization technique involving Laurent polynomials (polynomials with negative exponents) that was previously introduced by Aaronson, Kothari, Kretschmer, and Thaler [AKKT19].

New Approaches for Quantum Copy-Protection.
Quantum copy protection uses the unclonability of quantum states to construct quantum software that provably cannot be pirated. Copy protection would be immensely useful, but unfortunately little is known about how to achieve it in general. In this work, we make progress on this goal, by giving the following results:
– We show how to copy protect any program that cannot be learned from its input/output behavior, relative to a classical oracle. This improves on Aaronson [CCC’09], which achieves the same relative to a quantum oracle. By instantiating the oracle with post-quantum candidate obfuscation schemes, we obtain a heuristic construction of copy protection.
– We show, roughly, that any program which can be watermarked can be copy detected, a weaker version of copy protection that does not prevent copying, but guarantees that any copying can be detected. Our scheme relies on the security of the assumed watermarking, plus the assumed existence of public key quantum money. Our construction is general, applicable to many recent watermarking schemes.

Like most quantum computing theorists, I guess, I’m thrilled if Majorana particles can be created using existing technology, I’m sad if they can’t be, but I don’t have any special investment in or knowledge of the topic, beyond what I read in the news or hear from colleagues. Certainly Majorana particles seem neither necessary nor sufficient for building a scalable quantum computer, although they’d be a step forward for the topological approach to QC.
The purpose of this post is to invite informed scientific discussion of the relevant issues—first and foremost so that I can learn something, and second so that my readers can! I’d be especially interested to understand:
- Weren’t there, like, several other claims to have produced Majoranas? What of those then?
- If, today, no one has convincingly demonstrated the existence of Majoranas, then do people think it more likely that they were produced but not detected, or that they weren’t even produced?
- How credible are the explanations as to what went wrong?
- Are there any broader implications for the prospects of topological QC, or Microsoft’s path to topological QC, or was this just an isolated mistake?",1573,"['b75881d14c9b2a0ca0f31cfc2582ca14ef0efc7b77608b958dfd5e1104a0463e', '4d39bab93d6c986aa9c2bd46e3875acaa8f0b172231c33e6ec773d54610b1d6d', '347c8a71503ac1895a9d4ac9d1948bd1556ac0ba1cfa8b5d790afb05cfd940ea', '3684a393a62b25a7087418b568b5ce013ecb6f3ed1843bcaf17c525dd43c9c31', 'fe2154acc61289d436ac41502af265e5b7a9fc559a3b3f5acee617fc3a3f5c17', 'acf949eba07bfc6fbb1c047f0c9c6e9ae7a6c37bfd92c77b2117c0aa77eef904', '4ec1f1c2bf762ea50d7eece7d39224067a2c79eeffa85f035db94d4ec641ee0a', 'afd795b2ed1205174ba5eef0396d63968b4ea0bcce52ca7200f504fd85af5738', '290567c88e087d79a0c8304cc5742104f3afdc8d8647634a73a3beaf9f5aa9ba', '07518dbc0ecf65a3d3f5d6510fe2380b917a56cd5f6c216b50b2a494508176db', '222e2e276a1647eb9f78acb896fe39a41aea95af7768de6438c31aadefcc6c98', 'dcfe23a023bb07c7008715d7b176e25532fb41c95fc780d0f14af80ad84b02d5', '1e8b663a2ccad2df6932eed52459041b5911447676be8a1ae9d7c2205702935e', '13b21b4f03614b2d422f31430f6ed7e4d7b750ae801c1d308753fa23dd5b6fae', '1633caa1cd9606b7927430aa65142097aef6551fa373b00a1d8792e3254a6536', '32d04c3672ba0e0a9803fc8e41d3902ae358ffe3db6625855a41fab665146067', '2b024b9bda213e272d000662b115a2b3b2864edaf5447cf52774894bd8b7e351', '5426fa2a63fd938b102352442ba2aaffd61a3abab1994b6a2af088318d6cbd0b']"
49,5371,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5371,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-03-07,Scott Aaronson,Another axe swung at the Sycamore,"So there’s an interesting new paper on the arXiv by Feng Pan and Pan Zhang, entitled “Simulating the Sycamore supremacy circuits.” It’s about a new tensor contraction strategy for classically simulating Google’s 53-qubit quantum supremacy experiment from Fall 2019. Using their approach, and using just 60 GPUs running for a few days, the authors say they managed to generate a million correlated 53-bit strings—meaning, strings that all agree on a specific subset of 20 or so bits—that achieve a high linear cross-entropy score.
Alas, I haven’t had time this weekend to write a “proper” blog post about this, but several people have by now emailed to ask my opinion, so I thought I’d share the brief response I sent to a journalist.
This does look like a significant advance on simulating Sycamore-like random quantum circuits! Since it’s based on tensor networks, you don’t need the literally largest supercomputer on the planet filling up tens of petabytes of hard disk space with amplitudes, as in the brute-force strategy proposed by IBM. Pan and Zhang’s strategy seems most similar to the strategy previously proposed by Alibaba, with the key difference being that the new approach generates millions of correlated samples rather than just one.
I guess my main thoughts for now are:
- Once you knew about this particular attack, you could evade it and get back to where we were before by switching to a more sophisticated verification test — namely, one where you not only computed a Linear XEB score for the observed samples, you also made sure that the samples didn’t share too many bits in common. (Strangely, though, the paper never mentions this point.)
- The other response, of course, would just be to redo random circuit sampling with a slightly bigger quantum computer, like the ~70-qubit devices that Google, IBM, and others are now building!

50,5359,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5359,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-03-04,Scott Aaronson,The Zen Anti-Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics,"As I lay bedridden this week, knocked out by my second dose of the Moderna vaccine, I decided I should blog some more half-baked ideas because what the hell? It feels therapeutic, I have tenure, and anyone who doesn’t like it can close their broswer tab.
So: although I’ve written tens of thousands of words, on this blog and elsewhere, about interpretations of quantum mechanics, again and again I’ve dodged the question of which interpretation (if any) I really believe myself. Today, at last, I’ll emerge from the shadows and tell you precisely where I stand.
I hold that all interpretations of QM are just crutches that are better or worse at helping you along to the Zen realization that QM is what it is and doesn’t need an interpretation. As Sidney Coleman famously argued, what needs reinterpretation is not QM itself, but all our pre-quantum philosophical baggage—the baggage that leads us to demand, for example, that a wavefunction |ψ⟩ either be “real” like a stubbed toe or else “unreal” like a dream. Crucially, because this philosophical baggage differs somewhat from person to person, the “best” interpretation—meaning, the one that leads most quickly to the desired Zen state—can also differ from person to person. Meanwhile, though, thousands of physicists (and chemists, mathematicians, quantum computer scientists, etc.) have approached the Zen state merely by spending decades working with QM, never worrying much about interpretations at all. This is probably the truest path; it’s just that most people lack the inclination, ability, or time.
Greg Kuperberg, one of the smartest people I know, once told me that the problem with the Many-Worlds Interpretation is not that it says anything wrong, but only that it’s “melodramatic” and “overwritten.” Greg is far along the Zen path, probably further than me.
You shouldn’t confuse the Zen Anti-Interpretation with “Shut Up And Calculate.” The latter phrase, mistakenly attributed to Feynman but really due to David Mermin, is something one might say at the beginning of the path, when one is as a baby. I’m talking here only about the endpoint of the path, which one can approach but never reach—the endpoint where you intuitively understand exactly what a Many-Worlder, Copenhagenist, or Bohmian would say about any given issue, and also how they’d respond to each other, and how they’d respond to the responses, etc. but after years of study and effort you’ve returned to the situation of the baby, who just sees the thing for what it is.
I don’t mean to say that the interpretations are all interchangeable, or equally good or bad. If you had to, you could call even me a “Many-Worlder,” but only in the following limited sense: that in fifteen years of teaching quantum information, my experience has consistently been that for most students, Everett’s crutch is the best one currently on the market. At any rate, it’s the one that’s the most like a straightforward picture of the equations, and the least like a wobbly tower of words that might collapse if you utter any wrong ones. Unlike Bohr, Everett will never make you feel stupid for asking the questions an inquisitive child would ask; he’ll simply give you answers that are as clear, logical, and internally consistent as they are metaphysically extravagant. That’s a start.
The Copenhagen Interpretation retains a place of honor as the first crutch, for decades the only crutch, and the one closest to the spirit of positivism. Unfortunately, wielding the Copenhagen crutch requires mad philosophical skillz—which parts of the universe should you temporarily regard as “classical”? which questions should be answered, and which deflected?—to the point where, if you’re capable of all that verbal footwork, then why do you even need a crutch in the first place? In the hands of amateurs—meaning, alas, nearly everyone—Copenhagen often leads away from rather than toward the Zen state, as one sees with the generations of New-Age bastardizations about “observations creating reality.”
As for deBroglie-Bohm—well, that’s a weird, interesting, baroque crutch, one whose actual details (the preferred basis and the guiding equation) are historically contingent and tied to specific physical systems. It’s probably the right crutch for someone—it gets eternal credit for having led Bell to discover the Bell inequality—but its quirks definitely need to be discarded along the way.
Note that, among those who approach the Zen state, many might still call themselves Many-Worlders or Copenhagenists or Bohmians or whatever—just as those far along in spiritual enlightenment might still call themselves Buddhists or Catholics or Muslims or Jews (or atheists or agnostics)—even though, by that point, they might have more in common with each other than they do with their supposed coreligionists or co-irreligionists.
Alright, but isn’t all this Zen stuff just a way to dodge the actual, substantive questions about QM, by cheaply claiming to have transcended them? If that’s your charge, then please help yourself to the following FAQ about the details of the Zen Anti-Interpretation.
- What is a quantum state? It’s a unit vector of complex numbers (or if we’re talking about mixed states, then a trace-1, Hermitian, positive semidefinite matrix), which encodes everything there is to know about a physical system.
- OK, but are the quantum states “ontic” (really out in the world), or “epistemic” (only in our heads)? Dude. Do “basketball games” really exist, or is that just a phrase we use to summarize our knowledge about certain large agglomerations of interacting quarks and leptons? Do even the “quarks” and “leptons” exist, or are those just words for excitations of the more fundamental fields? Does “jealousy” exist? Pretty much all our concepts are complicated grab bags of “ontic” and “epistemic,” so it shouldn’t surprise us if quantum states are too. Bad dichotomy.
- Why are there probabilities in QM? Because QM is a (the?) generalization of probability theory to involve complex numbers, whose squared absolute values are probabilities. It includes probability as a special case.
- But why do the probabilities obey the Born rule? Because, once the unitary part of QM has picked out the 2-norm as being special, for the probabilities also to be governed by the 2-norm is pretty much the only possibility that makes mathematical sense; there are many nice theorems formalizing that intuition under reasonable assumptions.
- What is an “observer”? It’s exactly what modern decoherence theory says it is: a particular kind of quantum system that interacts with other quantum systems, becomes entangled with them, and thereby records information about them—reversibly in principle but irreversibly in practice.
- Can observers be manipulated in coherent superposition, as in the Wigner’s Friend scenario? If so, they’d be radically unlike any physical system we’ve ever had direct experience with. So, are you asking whether such “observers” would be conscious, or if so what they’d be conscious of? Who the hell knows?
- Do “other” branches of the wavefunction—ones, for example, where my life took a different course—exist in the same sense this one does? If you start with a quantum state for the early universe and then time-evolve it forward, then yes, you’ll get not only “our” branch but also a proliferation of other branches, in the overwhelming majority of which Donald Trump was never president and civilization didn’t grind to a halt because of a bat near Wuhan. But how could we possibly know whether anything “breathes fire” into the other branches and makes them real, when we have no idea what breathes fire into this branch and makes it real? This is not a dodge—it’s just that a simple “yes” or “no” would fail to do justice to the enormity of such a question, which is above the pay grade of physics as it currently exists.
- Is this it? Have you brought me to the end of the path of understanding QM? No, I’ve just pointed the way toward the beginning of the path. The most fundamental tenet of the Zen Anti-Interpretation is that there’s no shortcut to actually working through the Bell inequality, quantum teleportation, Shor’s algorithm, the Kochen-Specker and PBR theorems, possibly even a … photon or a hydrogen atom, so you can see quantum probability in action and be enlightened. I’m further along the path than I was twenty years ago, but not as far along as some of my colleagues. Even the greatest quantum Zen masters will be able to get further when new quantum phenomena and protocols are discovered in the future. All the same, though—and this is another major teaching of the Zen Anti-Interpretation—there’s more to life than achieving greater and greater clarity about the foundations of QM. And on that note…
To those who asked me about Claus Peter Schnorr’s claim to have discovered a fast classical factoring algorithm, thereby “destroying” (in his words) the RSA cryptosystem, see (e.g.) this Twitter thread by Keegan Ryan, which explains what certainly looks like a fatal error in Schnorr’s paper.",9077,"['4674b515fe59b030d8bff54f85d0d45e57103d242702487ce9a94b3d6420f64b',

51,5270,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5270,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2021-01-27,Scott Aaronson,Research (by others) proceeds apace,"At age 39, I already feel more often than not like a washed-up has-been in complexity theory and quantum computing research. It’s not intelligence that I feel like I’ve lost, so much as two other necessary ingredients: burning motivation and time. But all is not lost: I still have students and postdocs to guide and inspire! I still have the people who email me every day—journalists, high-school kids, colleagues—asking this and that! Finally, I still have this blog, with which to talk about all the exciting research that others are doing!
Speaking of blogging about research: I know I ought to do more of it, so let me start right now.
- Last night, Renou et al. posted a striking paper on the arXiv entitled Quantum physics needs complex numbers. One’s immediate reaction to the title might be “well duh … who ever thought it didn’t?” (See this post of mine for a survey of explanations for why quantum mechanics “should have” involved complex numbers.) Renou et al., however, are interested in ruling out a subtler possibility: namely, that our universe is secretly based on a version of quantum mechanics with real amplitudes only, and that it uses extra Hilbert space dimensions that we don’t see in order to simulate complex quantum mechanics. Strictly speaking, such a possibility can never be ruled out, any more than one can rule out the possibility that the universe is a classical computer that simulates quantum mechanics. In the latter case, though, the whole point of Bell’s Theorem is to show that if the universe is secretly classical, then it also needs to be radically nonlocal (relying on faster-than-light communication to coordinate measurement outcomes). Renou et al. claim to show something analogous about real quantum mechanics: there’s an experiment—as it happens, one involving three players and two entangled pairs—for which conventional QM predicts an outcome that can’t be explained using any variant of QM that’s both local and secretly based on real amplitudes. Their experiment seems eminently doable, and I imagine it will be done in short order.
- A bunch of people from PsiQuantum posted a paper on the arXiv introducing “fusion-based quantum computation” (FBQC), a variant of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and apparently a new approach to fault-tolerance, which the authors say can handle a ~10% rate of lost photons. PsiQuantum is the large, Palo-Alto-based startup trying to build scalable quantum computers based on photonics. They’ve been notoriously secretive, to the point of not having a website. I’m delighted that they’re sharing details of the sort of thing they hope to build; I hope and expect that the FBQC proposal will be evaluated by people more qualified than me.
- Since this is already on social media: apparently, Marc Lackenby from Oxford will be giving a Zoom talk at UC Davis next week, about a quasipolynomial-time algorithm to decide whether a given knot is the unknot. A preprint doesn’t seem to be available yet, but this is a big deal if correct, on par with Babai’s quasipolynomial-time algorithm for graph isomorphism from four years ago (see this post). I can’t wait to see details! (Not that I’ll understand them well.)",3207,"['aa4bc825b1cb16556cce4b0015c93c2a4e63f38251681b7291c881e9c20c232e', '4900451116089ea63b5b7eca5d8067f570a0ae4fa589f7f87c7ae69cb73ee3eb', 'f9b2b929744436c8f46b8e11e488afbb16c9da799205576d62432f084603b827', '70164193d68d217c7735e1da6f09bb2bbdc709195c18fb715300bf88222606df', '7bed102baa00666f72543769c7b10d6c41cdc2091c00b538964d5f73078c3e72', '823f40222775e3234561ab1f440c7e7e3785f1c9a82f4d6a1d6048b574df2e2c', '06bc956b104b02bac29a375e134848daf6322c9a5612f396ebf962ba556ce769', '12c758562d40e177f88b4fbb000b025e7f69dce21a2678e64ab386e7ded0bd26', 'd1367e08feae4ebf862d78d02995e9a18c6506ff60fd67dee6f15d214b3aac27', '5620ee987ddb4fe150fd77673dfb1ba266d98b4331dae26c53b3e9febd286faa', '8c0144a46c0de04172e56c1e19d8001e05d00ea430dce3ac8e064dce960f2717', '4d3759f3f4df44e5506082b0c1aa758ed3cb7ba0a9ff8a016e3e5b10cbfbce64', '78c9bb50a748cde17f653dfebdb505b3aea941fb7dfc5940632819167b258713']"

Now that the topic is the perception of quantum computing in popular media, can I ask you Scott, and others who have thought about quantum computing in media, to comment on the following quotes about quantum computing made in Finnish TV news watched by ~1.5 million people:
“Qubits are the quantum computing equivalent of normal computers bits, which are ones and zeros. Unlike a bit, qubit is not just one or zero, instead it can be both one and zero at the same time.”
“-This is a device that makes the impossible possible. Even if all supercomputers of the world would do something together for years, they could not solve things that quantum computer will at some point solve in a snap of fingers.”
“-Here we are learning how to build a quantum computer, learn to develop different parts, learn to write software and to apply them for different tasks. The real benefits will certainly come in the next phases at the end of 2020’s.”
James Gallagher #16: In that case, I guess I’d need to picket the White House, with a sign demanding Biden give citizens the right to say that achieving a linear cross-entropy score of 1.002, on a given random 53-qubit quantum circuit C, counts as a “problem.”
The thing that really gets me is how many small things Biden has already changed that high the lengths Trump went to be cruel for no reason. Someone on Twitter called it “performative cruelty” which seemed apt. For example, the following features have been returned to the White House website:
1. It has a Spanish language version
2. It has a TTY/TDD phone number listed
3. It has a sign language guided tour of the White House
4. It has an accessibility statement and a form for giving feedback on accessibility
He has also added (for the first time):
1. A pronoun box on the contact form
2. A large-font mode
3. A high contrast mode
Sorry for being off topic a bit, but going back to basics…
In the electron double slit experiment, what if the screen was replaced with a “wire chamber”?
It would show the trajectory taken by each electron, possibly pointing back to a specific slit.
What would destroy the interference pattern in that situation?
OP, @1ZeR0 #3: FWIW, it’s worth noting that \(BQP \stackrel{?}{=} EXP\) is open, although I strongly doubt it.
@Me #28: I don’t know about Scott, but I’m not on Twitter at all.

I also did a four-part interview on the subject with Jonathan Tennenbaum at Asia Times, and other interviews elsewhere. None of that stopped some people, who I guess didn’t google, from writing to tell me how disappointed they were by my silence!
The reality, though, is that a lot has happened since the original announcement, so it’s way past time for an update.
I. The Quest to Spoof
Most importantly, other groups almost immediately went to work trying to refute the quantum supremacy claim, by finding some efficient classical algorithm to spoof the reported results. It’s important to understand that this is exactly how the process is supposed to work: as I’ve often stressed, a quantum supremacy claim is credible only if it’s open to the community to refute and if no one can. It’s also important to understand that, for reasons we’ll go into, there’s a decent chance that people will succeed in simulating the new experiment classically, although they haven’t yet. All parties to the discussion agree that the new experiment is, far and away, the closest any BosonSampling experiment has ever gotten to the quantum supremacy regime; the hard part is to figure out if it’s already there.
Part of me feels guilty that, as one of reviewers on the Science paper—albeit, one stressed and harried by kids and covid—it’s now clear that I didn’t exercise the amount of diligence that I could have, in searching for ways to kill the new supremacy claim. But another part of me feels that, with quantum supremacy claims, much like with proposals for new cryptographic codes, vetting can’t be the responsibility of one or two reviewers. Instead, provided the claim is serious—as this one obviously is—the only thing to do is to get the paper out, so that the entire community can then work to knock it down. Communication between authors and skeptics is also a hell of a lot faster when it doesn’t need to go through a journal’s editorial system.
Not surprisingly, one skeptic of the new quantum supremacy claim is Gil Kalai, who (despite Google’s result last year, which Gil still believes must be in error) rejects the entire possibility of quantum supremacy on quasi-metaphysical grounds. But other skeptics are current and former members of the Google team, including Sergio Boixo and John Martinis! And—pause to enjoy the irony—Gil has effectively teamed up with the Google folks on questioning the new claim. Another central figure in the vetting effort—one from whom I’ve learned much of what I know about the relevant issues over the last week—is Dutch quantum optics professor and frequent Shtetl-Optimized commenter Jelmer Renema.
Without further ado, why might the new experiment, impressive though it was, be efficiently simulable classically? A central reason for concern is photon loss: as Chaoyang Lu has now explicitly confirmed (it was implicit in the paper), up to ~70% of the photons get lost on their way through the beamsplitter network, leaving only ~30% to be detected. At least with “Fock state” BosonSampling—i.e., the original kind, the kind with single-photon inputs that Alex Arkhipov and I proposed in 2011—it seems likely to me that such a loss rate would be fatal for quantum supremacy; see for example this 2019 paper by Renema, Shchesnovich, and Garcia-Patron.
Incidentally, if anything’s become clear over the last two weeks, it’s that I, the co-inventor of BosonSampling, am no longer any sort of expert on the subject’s literature!
Anyway, one source of uncertainty regarding the photon loss issue is that, as I said in my last post, the USTC experiment implemented a 2016 variant of BosonSampling called Gaussian BosonSampling (GBS)—and Jelmer tells me that the computational complexity of GBS in the presence of losses hasn’t yet been analyzed in the relevant regime, though there’s been work aiming in that direction. A second source of uncertainty is simply that the classical simulations work in a certain limit—namely, fixing the rate of noise and then letting the numbers of photons and modes go to infinity—but any real experiment has a fixed number of photons and modes (in USTC’s case, they’re ~50 and ~100 respectively). It wouldn’t do to reject USTC’s claim via a theoretical asymptotic argument that would equally well apply to any non-error-corrected quantum supremacy demonstration!
OK, but if an efficient classical simulation of lossy GBS experiments exists, then what is it? How does it work? It turns out that we have a plausible candidate for the answer to that, originating with a 2014 paper by Gil Kalai and Guy Kindler. Given a beamsplitter network, Kalai and Kindler considered an infinite hierarchy of better and better approximations to the BosonSampling distribution for that network. Roughly speaking, at the first level (k=1), one pretends that the photons are just classical distinguishable particles. At the second level (k=2), one correctly models quantum interference involving pairs of photons, but none of the higher-order interference. At the third level (k=3), one correctly models three-photon interference, and so on until k=n (where n is the total number of photons), when one has reproduced the original BosonSampling distribution. At least when k is small, the time needed to spoof outputs at the kth level of the hierarchy should grow like nk. As theoretical computer scientists, Kalai and Kindler didn’t care whether their hierarchy produced any physically realistic kind of noise, but later work, by Shchesnovich, Renema, and others, showed that (as it happens) it does.
In its original paper, the USTC team ruled out the possibility that the first, k=1 level of this hierarchy could explain its experimental results. More recently, in response to inquiries by Sergio, Gil, Jelmer, and others, Chaoyang tells me they’ve ruled out the possibility that the k=2 level can explain their results either. We’re now eagerly awaiting the answer for larger values of k.
Let me add that I owe Gil Kalai the following public mea culpa. While his objections to QC have often struck me as unmotivated and weird, in the case at hand, Gil’s 2014 work with Kindler is clearly helping drive the scientific discussion forward. In other words, at least with BosonSampling, it turns out that Gil put his finger precisely on a key issue. He did exactly what every QC skeptic should do, and what I’ve always implored the skeptics to do.
II. BosonSampling vs. Random Circuit Sampling: A Tale of HOG and CHOG and LXEB
There’s a broader question: why should skeptics of a BosonSampling experiment even have to think about messy details like the rate of photon losses? Why shouldn’t that be solely the experimenters’ job?
To understand what I mean, consider the situation with Random Circuit Sampling, the task Google demonstrated last year with 53 qubits. There, the Google team simply collected the output samples and fed them into a benchmark that they called “Linear Cross-Entropy” (LXEB), closely related to what Lijie Chen and I called “Heavy Output Generation” (HOG) in a 2017 paper. With suitable normalization, an ideal quantum computer would achieve an LXEB score of 2, while classical random guessing would achieve an LXEB score of 1. Crucially, according to a 2019 result by me and Sam Gunn, under a plausible (albeit strong) complexity assumption, no subexponential-time classical spoofing algorithm should be able to achieve an LXEB score that’s even slightly higher than 1. In its experiment, Google reported an LXEB score of about 1.002, with a confidence interval much smaller than 0.002. Hence: quantum supremacy (subject to our computational assumption), with no further need to know anything about the sources of noise in Google’s chip! (More explicitly, Boixo, Smelyansky, and Neven did a calculation in 2017 to show that the Kalai-Kindler type of spoofing strategy definitely isn’t going to work against RCS and Linear XEB, with no computational assumption needed.)
So then why couldn’t the USTC team do something analogous with BosonSampling? Well, they tried to. They defined a measure that they called “HOG,” although it’s different from my and Lijie Chen’s HOG, more similar to a cross-entropy. Following Jelmer, let me call their measure CHOG, where the C could stand for Chinese, Chaoyang’s, or Changed. They calculated the CHOG for their experimental samples, and showed that it exceeds the CHOG that you’d get from the k=1 and k=2 levels of the Kalai-Kindler hierarchy, as well as from various other spoofing strategies, thereby ruling those out as classical explanations for their results.
The trouble is this: unlike with Random Circuit Sampling and LXEB, with BosonSampling and CHOG, we know that there are fast classical algorithms that achieve better scores than the trivial algorithm, the algorithm that just picks samples at random. That follows from Kalai and Kindler’s work, and it even more simply follows from a 2013 paper by me and Arkhipov, entitled “BosonSampling Is Far From Uniform.” Worse yet, with BosonSampling, we currently have no analogue of my 2019 result with Sam Gunn: that is, a result that would tell us (under suitable complexity assumptions) the highest possible CHOG score that we expect any efficient classical algorithm to be able to get. And since we don’t know exactly where that ceiling is, we can’t tell the experimentalists exactly what target they need to surpass in order to claim quantum supremacy. Absent such definitive guidance from us, the experimentalists are left playing whac-a-mole against this possible classical spoofing strategy, and that one, and that one.
This is an issue that I and others were aware of for years, although the new experiment has certainly underscored it. Had I understood just how serious the USTC group was about scaling up BosonSampling, and fast, I might’ve given the issue some more attention!
III. Fock vs. Gaussian BosonSampling
Above, I mentioned another complication in understanding the USTC experiment: namely, their reliance on Gaussian BosonSampling (GBS) rather than Fock BosonSampling (FBS), sometimes also called Aaronson-Arkhipov BosonSampling (AABS). Since I gave this issue short shrift in my previous post, let me make up for it now.
In FBS, the initial state consists of either 0 or 1 photons in each input mode, like so: |1,…,1,0,…,0⟩. We then pass the photons through our beamsplitter network, and measure the number of photons in each output mode. The result is that the amplitude of each possible output configuration can be expressed as the permanent of some n×n matrix, where n is the total number of photons. It was interest in the permanent, which plays a central role in classical computational complexity, that led me and Arkhipov to study BosonSampling in the first place.
The trouble is, preparing initial states like |1,…,1,0,…,0⟩ turns out to be really hard. No one has yet build a source that reliably outputs one and only one photon at exactly a specified time. This led two experimental groups to propose an idea that, in a 2013 post on this blog, I named Scattershot BosonSampling (SBS). In SBS, you get to use the more readily available “Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion” (SPDC) photon sources, which output superpositions over different numbers of photons, of the form $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \alpha_n |n \rangle |n \rangle, $$ where αn decreases exponentially with n. You then measure the left half of each entangled pair, hope to see exactly one photon, and are guaranteed that if you do, then there’s also exactly one photon in the right half. Crucially, one can show that, if Fock BosonSampling is hard to simulate approximately using a classical computer, then the Scattershot kind must be as well.
OK, so what’s Gaussian BosonSampling? It’s simply the generalization of SBS where, instead of SPDC states, our input can be an arbitrary “Gaussian state”: for those in the know, a state that’s exponential in some quadratic polynomial in the creation operators. If there are m modes, then such a state requires ~m2 independent parameters to specify. The quantum optics people have a much easier time creating these Gaussian states than they do creating single-photon Fock states.
While the amplitudes in FBS are given by permanents of matrices (and thus, the probabilities by the absolute squares of permanents), the probabilities in GBS are given by a more complicated matrix function called the Hafnian. Roughly speaking, while the permanent counts the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph, the Hafnian counts the number of perfect matchings in an arbitrary graph. The permanent and the Hafnian are both #P-complete. In the USTC paper, they talk about yet another matrix function called the “Torontonian,” which was invented two years ago. I gather that the Torontonian is just the modification of the Hafnian for the situation where you only have “threshold detectors” (which decide whether one or more photons are present in a given mode), rather than “number-resolving detectors” (which count how many photons are present).
If Gaussian BosonSampling includes Scattershot BosonSampling as a special case, and if Scattershot BosonSampling is at least as hard to simulate classically as the original BosonSampling, then you might hope that GBS would also be at least as hard to simulate classically as the original BosonSampling. Alas, this doesn’t follow. Why not? Because for all we know, a random GBS instance might be a lot easier than a random SBS instance. Just because permanents can be expressed using Hafnians, doesn’t mean that a random Hafnian is as hard as a random permanent.
Nevertheless, I think it’s very likely that the sort of analysis Arkhipov and I did back in 2011 could be mirrored in the Gaussian case. I.e., instead of starting with reasonable assumptions about the distribution and hardness of random permanents, and then concluding the classical hardness of approximate BosonSampling, one would start with reasonable assumptions about the distribution and hardness of random Hafnians (or “Torontonians”), and conclude the classical hardness of approximate GBS. But this is theoretical work that remains to be done!
IV. Application to Molecular Vibronic Spectra?
In 2014, Alan Aspuru-Guzik and collaborators put out a paper that made an amazing claim: namely that, contrary to what I and others had said, BosonSampling was not an intrinsically useless model of computation, good only for refuting QC skeptics like Gil Kalai! Instead, they said, a BosonSampling device (specifically, what would later be called a GBS device) could be directly applied to solve a practical problem in quantum chemistry. This is the computation of “molecular vibronic spectra,” also known as “Franck-Condon profiles,” whatever those are.
I never understood nearly enough about chemistry to evaluate this striking proposal, but I was always a bit skeptical of it, for the following reason. Nothing in the proposal seemed to take seriously that BosonSampling is a sampling task! A chemist would typically have some specific numbers that she wants to estimate, of which these “vibronic spectra” seemed to be an example. But while it’s often convenient to estimate physical quantities via Monte Carlo sampling over simulated observations of the physical system you care about, that’s not the only way to estimate physical quantities! And worryingly, in all the other examples we’d seen where BosonSampling could be used to estimate a number, the same number could also be estimated using one of several polynomial-time classical algorithms invented by Leonid Gurvits. So why should vibronic spectra be an exception?
After an email exchange with Alex Arkhipov, Juan Miguel Arrazola, Leonardo Novo, and Raul Garcia-Patron, I believe we finally got to the bottom of it, and the answer is: vibronic spectra are not an exception.
In terms of BosonSampling, the vibronic spectra task is simply to estimate the probability histogram of some weighted sum like $$ w_1 s_1 + \cdots + w_ m s_m, $$ where w1,…,wm are fixed real numbers, and (s1,…,sm) is a possible outcome of the BosonSampling experiment, si representing the number of photons observed in mode i. Alas, while it takes some work, it turns out that Gurvits’s classical algorithms can be adapted to estimate these histograms. Granted, running the actual BosonSampling experiment would provide slightly more detailed information—namely, some exact sampled values of $$ w_1 s_1 + \cdots + w_ m s_m, $$ rather than merely additive approximations to the values—but since we’d still need to sort those sampled values into coarse “bins” in order to compute a histogram, it’s not clear why that additional precision would ever be of chemical interest.
This is a pity, since if the vibronic spectra application had beaten what was doable classically, then it would’ve provided not merely a first practical use for BosonSampling, but also a lovely way to verify that a BosonSampling device was working as intended.
V. Application to Finding Dense Subgraphs?
A different potential application of Gaussian BosonSampling, first suggested by the Toronto-based startup Xanadu, is finding dense subgraphs in a graph. (Or at least, providing an initial seed to classical optimization methods that search for dense subgraphs.)
This is an NP-hard problem, so to say that I was skeptical of the proposal would be a gross understatement. Nevertheless, it turns out that there is a striking observation by the Xanadu team at the core of their proposal: namely that, given a graph G and a positive even integer k, a GBS device can be used to sample a random subgraph of G of size k, with probability proportional to the square of the number of perfect matchings in that subgraph. Cool, right? And potentially even useful, especially if the number of perfect matchings could serve as a rough indicator of the subgraph’s density! Alas, Xanadu’s Juan Miguel Arrazola himself recently told me that there’s a cubic-time classical algorithm for the same sampling task, so that the possible quantum speedup that one could get from GBS in this way is at most polynomial. The search for a useful application of BosonSampling continues!
And that’s all for now! I’m grateful to all the colleagues I talked to over the last couple weeks, including Alex Arkhipov, Juan Miguel Arrazola, Sergio Boixo, Raul Garcia-Patron, Leonid Gurvits, Gil Kalai, Chaoyang Lu, John Martinis, and Jelmer Renema, while obviously taking sole responsibility for any errors in the above. I look forward to a spirited discussion in the comments, and of course I’ll post updates as I learn more!",18808,"['dd44736fcf6fceee3d643152b8b5f9a4fd229fd882293152d4b4f155d4483647', '3bf7d63435ac042f1a71591de6123239e1aa6962fa53f8a2367f0910b6df7069', 'b46ff7d79904b9b75a7efedd3dad9387dfbfbf4b9b02a3d7ebe2651acb95e8c0', '91b004d39b4492d08b8a655b3af86e74dc0250ec9c0679b9841c104e27d869a6', 'e0ab5b0143dcef0cdf70d2307fef745ed00377fe88057ecb5722d1f32e214684', '9b615ab9551c380aa32eef622455139a15dd1878c13c599d980cd97b34915f9c', '66f47e81180236606abe869e2c31e206fbd55ab1d3d323f0d015d482ba3a70de', '3db2aba1088c3f723903a61676798f4ad11f6a84c304c66d0322331edff1f824', 'a1d2ca7863d445724cf0a3a11f56b77276cd3fca03491da4c885610316e9bbe1', '3938da93fc6a8be52bd2b74806c5b2d960900647e931fd309dee7714ef33aa5e', '0c127f7835155654ecb4d9da5ddd2ebc0d245923c9fbe95bafd9b7c661c1e24b', '0bc8a8521d779d25c6e7b9feb890b11249089cc6234d29965120b3942c4f5158', '1e74803744fcebc2feaba9ac3a830f8cded2090402a6694a49e2c201c85b8846', 'c1dedab1256287540ba526d0831b9a66a1be59784b07ac52b2dfd5c18c56b566', 'd6e237e4b71fb7b38a354b2b525da9ecf441d196e46fdb228e1ae8e754db110c', '48fa6fd2e156299c1c822db87ae12b1748f63e90dbd033bd4bb602c217b290e3', '05ecc34b70d64e5bbd6f6dd4d89451300988f1f87385c1d8a96d10624e41e50c', 'cd0c8f620eecb73ed67bdd09e31cd3affc211667e0516a129a0a638f4cce89ee', '2e76c1fc74141b17a071ca5d8a42925952069f229af7418d7adb649fa6d053b3', '059428c558bafca5a16b5b980ee56775057e844d7b548938713e75c34bc09cfa', '8cba6c42bf42e7c224103abd4187e437750ca948a6095a55d332dd75a7305db7', 'a2d7b96e1c670e1365adda55a305cb67cf54fad553ab04156fb31eb464790ac1', '220ba3b0a0594445ae67288a16a0acde941123089d5172e935ddeb617473addb', '5143b28cc6592c95ff7a0d86d309a647283ab854042e26a04e9627292a93680a', '1ae38951c3ae2d8534f38864dec6999870ee1fc26a59284f56d794c856839e96', '3c101ae8fc473b57b225a48498651a615bd72f7ffc555d42f7599ef521923034', 'ede3682712c34ac44644d3001c345f09593c52c2d58df3755b58f0a717a62c4b']"

In the QCQI sphere, you’d have Marina Radulaski, Bruno Nachtergaele, Martin Fraas, Mukund Rangamani, Veronika Hubeny, and Nick Curro as faculty colleagues, among others; and yours truly, and hopefully more people in the future. This year the UC Davis CS department has a faculty opening in quantum computing, and another faculty opening in CS theory including quantum computing. If you are interested, then time is of the essence, since the full-consideration deadline is December 15.
In this guest post, I will toot my own horn about a paper in progress (hopefully nearly finished) that goes back to the revolutionary early days of quantum computing, namely Shor’s algorithm. The takeway: I think that the strongest multidimensional generalization of Shor’s algorithm has been missed for decades. It appears to be a new algorithm that does more than the standard generalization described by Kitaev. (Scott wanted me to channel Captain Kirk and boldly go with a takeaway, so I did.)
Unlike Shor’s algorithm proper, I don’t know of any dramatic applications of this new algorithm. However, more than one quantum algorithm was discovered just because it looked interesting, and then found applications later. The input to Shor’s algorithm is a function \(f:\mathbb{Z} \to S\), in other words a symbol-valued function \(f\) on the integers, which is periodic with an unknown period \(p\) and otherwise injective. In equations, \(f(x) = f(y)\) if only if \(p\) divides \(x-y\). In saying that the input is a function \(f\), I mean that Shor’s algorithm is provided with an algorithm to compute \(f\) efficiently. Shor’s algorithm itself can then find the period \(p\) in (quantum) polynomial time in the number of digits of \(p\). (Not polynomial time in \(p\), polynomial time in its logarithm.) If you’ve heard that Shor’s algorithm can factor integers, that is just one special case where \(f(x) = a^x\) mod \(N\), the integer to factor. In its generalized form, Shor’s algorithm is miraculous. In particular, if \(f\) is a black-box function, then it is routine to prove that any classical algorithm to do the same thing needs exponentially many values of \(f\), or values \(f(x)\) where \(x\) has exponentially many digits.
Shor’s algorithm begat the Shor-Kitaev algorithm, which does the same thing for a higher dimensional periodic function \(f:\mathbb{Z}^d \to S\), where \(f\) is now periodic with respect to a lattice \(L\). The Shor-Kitaev algorithm in turn begat the hidden subgroup problem (called HSP among friends), where \(\mathbb{Z}\) or \(\mathbb{Z}^d\) is replaced by a group \(G\), and now \(f\) is \(L\)-periodic for some subgroup \(L\). HSP varies substantially in both its computationally difficulty and its complexity status, depending on the structure of \(G\) as well as optional restrictions on \(L\).
A funny thing happened
on the way to the forum in later work on HSP. Most of the later work has been in the special case that the ambient group \(G\) is finite, even though \(G\) is infinite in the famous case of Shor’s algorithm. My paper-to-be explores the hidden subgroup problem in various cases when \(G\) is infinite. In particular, I noticed that even the case \(G = \mathbb{Z}^d\) isn’t fully solved, because the Shor-Kitaev algorithm makes the extra assumption that \(L\) is a maximum-rank lattice, or equivalently that \(L\) a finite-index subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}^d\). As far as I know, the more general case where \(L\) might have lower rank wasn’t treated previously. I found an extension of Shor-Kitaev to handle this case, which is I will sketch after discussing some points about HSP in general.
Quantum algorithms for HSP
Every known quantum algorithm for HSP has the same two opening steps. First prepare an equal superposition \(|\psi_G\rangle\) of “all” elements of the ambient group \(G\), then apply a unitary form of the hiding function \(f\) to get the following: \[ U_f|\psi_G\rangle \propto \sum_{x \in G} |x,f(x)\rangle. \] Actually, you can only do exactly this when \(G\) is a finite group. You cannot make an equal quantum superposition on an infinite set, for the same reason that you cannot choose an integer uniformly at random from among all of the integers: It would defy the laws of probability. Since computers are finite, a realistic quantum algorithm cannot make an unequal quantum superposition on an infinite set either. However, if \(G\) is a well-behaved infinite group, then you can approximate the same idea by making an equal superposition on a large but finite box \(B \subseteq G\) instead: \[ U_f|\psi_G\rangle \propto \sum_{x \in B \subseteq G} |x,f(x)\rangle. \] Quantum algorithms for HSP now follow a third counterintuitive “step”, namely, that you should discard the output qubits that contain the value \(f(x)\). You should take the values of \(f\) to be incomprehensible data, encrypted for all you know. A good quantum algorithm evaluates \(f\) too few times to interpret its output, so you might as well let it go. (By contrast, a classical algorithm is forced to dig for the only meaningful information that the output of \(f\) to have. Namely, it has to keep searching until it finds equal values.) What remains, want what turns out to be highly valuable, is the input state in a partially measured form. I remember joking with Cris Moore about the different ways of looking at this step:
- You can measure the output qubits.
- The janitor can fish the output qubits out of the trash and measure them for you.
- You can secretly not measure the output qubits and say you did.
- You can keep the output qubits and say you threw them away.
Measuring the output qubits wins you the purely mathematical convenience that the posterior state on the input qubits is pure (a vector state) rather than mixed (a density matrix). However, since no use is made of the measured value, it truly makes no difference for the algorithm.
The final universal step for all HSP quantum algorithms is to apply a quantum Fourier transform (or QFT) to the input register and measure the resulting Fourier mode. This might seem like a creative step that may or may not be a good idea. However, if you have an efficient algorithm for the QFT for your particular group \(G\), then you might as well do this, because (taking the interpretation that you threw away the output register) the environment already knows the Fourier mode. You can assume that this Fourier mode has been published in the New York Times, and you won’t lose anything by reading the papers.
Fourier modes and Fourier stripes
I’ll now let \(G = \mathbb{Z}^d\) and make things more explicit, for starters by putting arrows on elements \(\vec{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^d\) to indicate that they are lattice vectors. The standard begining produces a superposition \(|\psi_{L+\vec{v}}\rangle\) on a translate \(L+\vec{v}\) of the hidden lattice \(L\). (Again, \(L\) is the periodicity of \(f\).) If this state could be an equal superposition on the infinite set \(L+\vec{v}\), and if you could do a perfect QFT on the infinite group \(\mathbb{Z}^d\), then the resulting Fourier mode would be a randomly chosen element of a certain dual group \(L^\# \subseteq (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^d\) inside the torus of Fourier modes of \(\mathbb{Z}^d\). Namely, \(L^\#\) consists of those vectors \(\vec{y} \in (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^d\) whose such that the dot product \(\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y}\) is an integer for every \(\vec{x} \in L\). (If you expected the Fourier dual of the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) to be a circle \(\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}\) of length \(2\pi\), I found it convenient here to rescale it to a circle \(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\) of length 1. This is often considered gauche these days, like using \(h\) instead of \(\hbar\) in quantum mechanics, but in context it’s okay.) In principle, you can learn \(L^\#\) from sampling it, and then learn \(L\) from \(L^\#\). Happily, the unknown and irrelevant translation vector \(\vec{v}\) is erased in this method.
In practice, it’s not so simple. As before, you cannot actually make an equal superposition on all of \(L+\vec{v}\), but only trimmed to a box \(B \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d\). If you have \(q\) qubits available for each coordinate of \(\mathbb{Z}^d\), then \(B\) might be a \(d\)-dimensional cube with \(Q = 2^q\) lattice points in each direction. Following Peter Shor’s famous paper, the standard thing to do here is to identify \(B\) with the finite group \((\mathbb{Z}/Q)^d\) and do the QFT there instead. This is gauche as pure mathematics, but it’s reasonable as computer science. In any case, it works, but it comes at a price. You should rescale the resulting Fourier mode \(\vec{y} \in (\mathbb{Z}/Q)^d\) as \(\vec{y}_1 = \vec{y}/Q\) to match it to the torus \((\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^d\). Even if you do that, \(\vec{y}_1\) is not actually a uniformly random element of \(L^\#\), but rather a noisy, discretized approximation of one.
In Shor’s algorithm, the remaining work is often interpreted as the post-climax. In this case \(L = p\mathbb{Z}\), where \(p\) is the hidden period of \(f\), and \(L^\#\) consists of the multiples of \(1/p\) in \(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\). The Fourier mode \(y_1\) (skipping the arrow since we are in one dimension) is an approximation to some fraction \(r/p\) with roughly \(q\) binary digits of precision. (\(y_1\) is often but not always the very best binary approximation to \(r/p\) with the available precision.) If you have enough precision, you can learn a fraction from its digits, either in base 2 or in any base. For instance, if I’m thinking of a fraction that is approximately 0.2857, then 2/7 is much closer than any other fraction with a one-digit denominator. As many people know, and as Shor explained in his paper, continued fractions are an efficient and optimal algorithm for this in larger cases.
The Shor-Kitaev algorithm works the same way. You can denoise each coordinate of each Fourier example \(\vec{y}_1\) with the continued fraction algorithm to obtain an exact element \(\vec{y}_0 \in L^\#\). You can learn \(L^\#\) with a polynomial number of samples, and then learn \(L\) from that with integer linear algebra. However, this approach can only work if \(L^\#\) is a finite group, or equivalently when \(L\) has maximum rank \(d\). This condition is explicitly stated in Kitaev’s paper, and in most but not all of the papers and books that cite this algorithm. if \(L\) has maximum rank, then the picture in Fourier space looks like this:
However, if \(L\) has rank \(\ell < d\), then \(L^\#\) is a pattern of \((k-\ell)\)-dimensional stripes, like this instead:
In this case, as the picture indicates, each coordinate of \(\vec{y}_1\) is flat random and individually irreparable. If you knew the direction of the stripes, then you use could define a slanted coordinate system where some of the coordinates of \(\vec{y}_1\) could be repaired. But the tangent directions of \(L^\#\) essentially beg the question. They are the orthogonal space of \(L_\mathbb{R}\), the vector space subtended by the hidden subgroup \(L\). If you know \(L_\mathbb{R}\), then you can find \(L\) by running Shor-Kitaev in the lattice \(L_\mathbb{R} \cap \mathbb{Z}^d\).
My solution to this conundrum is to observe that the multiples of a randomly chosen point \(\vec{y}_0\) in \(L^\#\) have a good chance of filling out \(L^\#\) adequately well, in particular to land near \(\vec{0}\) often enough to reveal the tangent directions of \(L^\#\). You have to make do with a noisy sample \(\vec{y}_1\) instead, but by making the QFT radix \(Q\) large enough, you can reduce the noise well enough for this to work. Still, even if you know that these small, high-quality multiples of \(\vec{y}_1\) exist, they are needles in an exponential haystack of bad multiples, so how do you find them? It turns out that the versatile LLL algorithm, which finds a basis of short vectors in a lattice, can be used here. The multiples of \(\vec{y}_0\) (say, for simplicity) aren’t a lattice, they are a dense orbit in \(L^\#\) or part of it. However, they are a shadow of a lattice one dimension higher, that you can supply to the LLL algorithm. This step produces lets you compute the linear span \(L_\mathbb{R}\) of \(L\) from its perpendicular space, and then as mentioned you can use Shor-Kitaev to learn the exact geometry of \(L\).",12604,"['9b73139123395a1542be8b186b9efcae58031ccb745ca6c695f1c71281e50bdb', '840b6e1a3a7a1a2ce2003a2c97708ac8eb9fb45eb1f51055335efed4b0ac8734', '9d710d5dbf44f193189cb944dc3063895fa2edf299d9a228904bf23900354b9f', '1867ecbdf4fdd506e19fd035d8f2bea76721182f7da02dd9fdf5c8991da18436', '6970cfaa72d328ab2118fd458e47134a249f19a120f3b64beab1c624b71eaa0f', 'd812b2bdbe957754d0464b301a5ccc51ea80e5042a42112336153fb049090e2b', 'f2921d87fadc8081d394a897b1a5da956b11b21393e3ec6edcbaa9a25520a4e1', 'd8f6a822c743d1893cb2177bca61c38cdf02c8bfbc6dd7b676852a4596569641', 'e59532f38dda42ebaec504233c0c290a60afd5521e0ac567e1a87177def72eb9', 'a1482de8b0ea6cc989df1b9282b445ac4fae12d3976229ab9d1a65eb26022f75', 'b9916b768258bf5d7e89dcfeff7ecd9bb30990a27a0ec874e6787441255173e2', '589cd9c619df995c2ba2ed08b6e72ebdc02e5c66d6f7ff091a5b8bac6969d2d7', 'f5d9702f03a91aeda7b6efaf70b7438f5f55c71dca9411c1bc36ad53543abe65']"
55,5122,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5122,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2020-12-03,Scott Aaronson,"Quantum supremacy, now with BosonSampling","Update (12/5): The Google team, along with Gil Kalai, have raised questions about whether the results of the new BosonSampling experiment might be easier to spoof classically than the USTC team thought they were, because of a crucial difference between BosonSampling and qubit-based random circuit sampling. Namely, with random circuit sampling, the marginal distribution over any k output qubits (for small k) is exponentially close to the uniform distribution. With BosonSampling, by contrast, the marginal distribution over k output modes is distinguishable from uniform, as Arkhipov and I noted in a 2013 followup paper. On the one hand, these easily-detected nonuniformities provide a quick, useful sanity check for whether BosonSampling is being done correctly. On the other hand, they might also give classical spoofing algorithms more of a toehold. The question is whether, by spoofing the k-mode marginals, a classical algorithm could also achieve scores on the relevant “HOG” (Heavy Output Generation) benchmark that are comparable to what the USTC team reported.
One way or the other, this question should be resolvable by looking at the data that’s already been collected, and we’re trying now to get to the bottom of it. And having failed to flag this potential issue when I reviewed the paper, I felt a moral obligation at least to let my readers know about it as soon as I did. If nothing else, this is an answer to those who claim this stuff is all obvious. Please pardon the science underway!
A group led by Jianwei Pan and Chao-Yang Lu, based mainly at USTC in Hefei, China, announced today that it achieved BosonSampling with 40-70 detected photons—up to and beyond the limit where a classical supercomputer could feasibly verify the results. (Technically, they achieved a variant called Gaussian BosonSampling: a generalization of what I called Scattershot BosonSampling in a 2013 post on this blog.)
For more, see also Emily Conover’s piece in Science News, or Daniel Garisto’s in Scientific American, both of which I consulted on. (Full disclosure: I was one of the reviewers for the Pan group’s Science paper, and will be writing the Perspective article to accompany it.)
The new result follows the announcement of 14-photon BosonSampling by the same group a year ago. It represents the second time quantum supremacy has been reported, following Google’s celebrated announcement from last year, and the first time it’s been done using photonics rather than superconducting qubits.
As the co-inventor of BosonSampling (with Alex Arkhipov), obviously I’m gratified about this.
For anyone who regards it as boring or obvious, here and here is Gil Kalai, on this blog, telling me why BosonSampling would never scale beyond 8-10 photons. (He wrote that, if aliens forced us to try, then much like with the Ramsey number R(6,6), our only hope would be to attack the aliens.) Here’s Kalai making a similar prediction, on the impossibility of quantum supremacy by BosonSampling or any other means, in his plenary address to the International Congress of Mathematicians two years ago.
Even if we set aside the quantum computing skeptics, many colleagues told me they thought experimental BosonSampling was a dead end, because of photon losses and the staggering difficulty of synchronizing 50-100 single-photon sources. They said that a convincing demonstration of quantum supremacy would have to await the arrival of quantum fault-tolerance—or at any rate, some hardware platform more robust than photonics. I always agreed that they might be right. Furthermore, even if 50-photon BosonSampling was possible, after Google reached the supremacy milestone first with superconducting qubits, it wasn’t clear if anyone would still bother. Even when I learned a year ago about the USTC group’s intention to go for it, I was skeptical, figuring I’d believe it when I saw it.
Obviously the new result isn’t dispositive. Nevertheless, as someone whose intellectual origins are close to pure math, it’s strange and exciting to find myself in a field where, once in a while, the world itself gets to weigh in on a theoretical disagreement.
Since excitement is best when paired with accurate understanding, please help yourself to the following FAQ, which I might add more to over the next couple days.
What is BosonSampling? You must be new here! Briefly, it’s a proposal for achieving quantum supremacy by simply passing identical, non-interacting photons through an array of beamsplitters, and then measuring where they end up. For more: in increasing order of difficulty, here’s an MIT News article from back in 2011, here’s the Wikipedia page, here are my PowerPoint slides, here are my lecture notes from Rio de Janeiro, and here’s my original paper with Arkhipov.
What is quantum supremacy? Roughly, the use of a programmable or configurable quantum computer to solve some well-defined computational problem much faster than we know how to solve it with any existing classical computer. “Quantum supremacy,” a term coined by John Preskill in 2012, does not mean useful QC, or scalable QC, or fault-tolerant QC, all of which remain outstanding challenges. For more, see my Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ, or (e.g.) my recent Lytle Lecture for the University of Washington.
If Google already announced quantum supremacy a year ago, what’s the point of this new experiment? To me, at least, quantum supremacy seems important enough to do at least twice! Also, as I said, this represents the first demonstration that quantum supremacy is possible via photonics. Finally, as the authors point out, the new experiment has one big technical advantage compared to Google’s: namely, many more possible output states (~1030 of them, rather than a mere ~9 quadrillion). This makes it infeasible to calculate the whole probability distribution over outputs and store it on a gigantic hard disk (after which one could easily generate as many samples as one wanted), which is what IBM proposed doing in its response to Google’s announcement.
Is BosonSampling a form of universal quantum computing? No, we don’t even think it can simulate universal classical computing! It’s designed for exactly one task: namely, demonstrating quantum supremacy and refuting Gil Kalai. It might have some other applications besides that, but if so, they’ll be icing on the cake. This is in contrast to Google’s Sycamore processor, which in principle is a universal quantum computer, just with a severe limit on the number of qubits (53) and how many layers of gates one can apply to them (about 20).
Is BosonSampling at least a step toward universal quantum computing? I think so! In 2000, Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn (KLM) famously showed that pure, non-interacting photons, passing through a network of beamsplitters, are capable of universal QC, provided we assume one extra thing: namely, the ability to measure the photons at intermediate times, and change which beamsplitters to apply to the remaining photons depending on the outcome. In other words, “BosonSampling plus adaptive measurements equals universality.” Basically, KLM is the holy grail that experimental optics groups around the world have been working toward for 20 years, with BosonSampling just a more achievable pit stop along the way.
Are there any applications of BosonSampling? We don’t know yet. There are proposals in the literature to apply BosonSampling to vibronic spectra in quantum chemistry, finding dense subgraphs, and other problems, but I’m not yet sure whether these proposals will yield real speedups over the best we can do with classical computers, for a task of practical interest that involves estimating specific numbers (as opposed to sampling tasks, where BosonSampling almost certainly does yield exponential speedups, but which are rarely the thing practitioners directly care about). [See this comment for further discussion of the issues regarding dense subgraphs.] In a completely different direction, one could try to use BosonSampling to generate cryptographically certified random bits, along the lines of my proposal from 2018, much like one could with qubit-based quantum circuits.
How hard is it to simulate BosonSampling on a classical computer? As far as we know today, the difficulty of simulating a “generic” BosonSampling experiment increases roughly like 2n, where n is the number of detected photons. It might be easier than that, particularly when noise and imperfections are taken into account; and at any rate it might be easier to spoof the statistical tests that one applies to verify the outputs. I and others managed to give some theoretical evidence against those possibilities, but just like with Google’s experiment, it’s conceivable that some future breakthrough will change the outlook and remove the case for quantum supremacy.
Do you have any amusing stories? When I refereed the Science paper, I asked why the authors directly verified the results of their experiment only for up to 26-30 photons, relying on plausible extrapolations beyond that. While directly verifying the results of n-photon BosonSampling takes ~2n time for any known classical algorithm, I said, surely it should be possible with existing computers to go up to n=40 or n=50? A couple weeks later, the authors responded, saying that they’d now verified their results up to n=40, but it burned $400,000 worth of supercomputer time so they decided to stop there. This was by far the most expensive referee report I ever wrote!
Also: when Covid first started, and facemasks were plentiful in China but almost impossible to get in the US, Chao-Yang Lu, one of the leaders of the new work and my sometime correspondent on the theory of BosonSampling, decided to mail me a box of 200 masks (I didn’t ask for it). I don’t think that influenced my later review, but it was appreciated nonetheless.
Huge congratulations to the whole team for their accomplishment!",9935,"['0d0060111f62fa2079c9cc8a3b366182a11cfe42069420e805b5a2bd29bfcdf2', 'e4ec55926ffcd5cb4c30152ce78fa1cce4e4d6d85c1dfea5f8f91708a7c979fa', 'c83497f430a7fd6fa5048eab7e6ad8bb29424b3e886375b9c3a0a8ac7cfc1c80', '44a929b31e02659396ee36f320444442cc5c90d18e49abf016503b9afc03ce7e', 'f18206c2d19fe95975146c075ceb5dfdf8e26b785eb6754f2c303fa6fa23e020', '45fcdf2ad00172a41501d5a709966ab659339165fa9b8d74d9170812c2d8deb9', 'd1a8544fa8a727ba1e1fccadaa85b4f1f1163d079156f59d6ffb4e0ee24fd3c9', '0642e4ab82d591fbd76f7d1dd2a210788d27aef07f1e155ea03afad259653017', '72048348b72dee1c42a8f8609f4686178c2cf86e285d939efee29d5d351dcaea', 'c269c39b3d821a42cb776d3cdf563828c342cae49e709c4362f1083a32d34bef', 'eef538a344e8b9d923db0c7dca1cbf11415839c8272d007c2a82b978f24fc6a0', 'd87597eaf6892c447117154eb2a2867a9781414a2d006bd839ac3ca8f63f0b10', 'de295fc58e14dd83d2a016fa6228242cb8289ef92411f4f63d51a8e88b9d359b', '04d331c65ce95bd1b8115273bf741ad5d739a4eb2d526ee2a6e55f7a5b6b8c00', 'b422fd12468935a31ad06de2c0971d21ffc89bd249a83d9d6416e98426a2f016', 'a741e65d3a896b882ea4271ed731090eabd3ba3ec37c3930564fbb8c6334d612', 'd7ba1eb7cfcc914ff987ee945035a86c48716207f8173dc166c834119d995938', 'f951ac0c19dd52941d94458bfdf7e3fec6a028c8c5be4c30d49f78fef868517e', '34bbca6777e4c338345ef6ba118bd92e63c5f0220cc4df655d88c3a90b797fcc', 'e022fe54567501394c3dba1e3faca0b63f4889f216ce512f4ba727946fc1765d', '485711686405fedfcb085ca6287775cfd338f013632f47522152693c9cde704a', '2dfb9842fd5d02fe6d9cd9697ca0cd9f20e831c106fdcb9fc9a60e4182e9c8a5', '7db09f65113f3181e7f89088342e3618922baa09c22d0e0c12e935a37a941a19', 'f350a8c712c84a673e8dc987380b6ce70db42a0317c2cd467dc77ca4b83dd668', '66421199d581efa194c1ebcf8d2d3bf3df76f7c5035f5dea394b517f35da4cb7', 'a342d9e3bb87902713e1129a186ca10bbc8aeb7465adb619b2c272afcc315251', 'a342d9e3bb87902713e1129a186ca10bbc8aeb7465adb619b2c272afcc315251', '1ace39e132a383ec775b726ffeda7f325fbc32849720e491e1155d087fe5f4ae', '859f46eb40ec08d1564c63d6e4e901a7e0f3915f79a4048ce4d30551ca880658', 'b99ab6ec2db0e5a4bb209e626b0cac6e7ab5568affc4e014f1b8d6be0f9768c1', '55bb8e3043186e7f8d4a914c4d8d1af49598b687699e7bf294e0977534a824ef', 'cb0092a707aeb6c8f855fc61d42defb42e3dc3e681b21fbeb7e3d2ef72f9aab4', '4d611c5c6c8acc592d6a061c26a2882e2c3965022f300a81a688b638da4c2e44', '068e0b15dcee2b229b15573ca8351d99ab4679fd38dca0b4f66f2f57a42c42c4', '7d89a23b0d46f279bf8cab9debe3aa1707496595a1495f8141268d85ac634d9d', 'a64c20434a3477f11b8473bf10f8f2ec6965e25dd66aee2a8ec50c9a5c9982e6', '9d910d5f02b92dd044e1533eb37dc4f68f660e98c7215993f5226036fb3ded4b', '858790bb395137dddec9ed5ed63634d61a85c01f7b37a49e1ea3295002af1e15', '298c7888fb850dec1ffe264f4da5d52df0c92a192ca2046d47ff47f9b72446a5', '6a164e8a3b24f2b109e1a980d39282463f64b0695d5d5507a29fe0e4470f127c', '51b56b30384e71cf090a88a62c18bfaa694a5c796ff0ac7d7e792d519e36b8ee', 'da7b547889431b02fcee49cd6a0ca7c24ea5718659b235bdfcb0544ae5607a4a', '4f76a194aa8aa82dc7f1f724b74701673834d63b71201191664439f1d72d6499', 'a8b87d688142addc7f405eb9c712ca206bbaff7ce7b08d3b2ba37e33c66de91c', '43eb36cdbba046dd9645c517a4940d0ba6d10c0ea7128c5b437766033b0ddec1', '323cd183d9cca333b82d10a83916abb0bdcf77bcd646230bafac406f6b0bda05', '4434c156cae2aaba046f7bd3606b48628724aded18b9825151cbb1d0cd9f3438', '43ff1291577a9ab62bba8f812b97bed03e8baf6e73aa060b418e8478d2b28c13', 'c74cb0ca92889823718b08769fd53319262e53bedc9cca081ec0646006688ca4', 'c210e4e78519d6232cd487e5aaa2c82e6eb490ec285f4740a96fa98159773f99', '021630a32fd7926d9b8a7bd1036e248a124e20189083dd5042a323d6417da7c3', 'df9417f1d581dab4c78575ee84e98281ca08ba4cbf7c5fe0f88d899cebc47a17', 'b0209325dc39dfe95c87d84834c364cd625918324f2c88eca77422e7d5754baf', 'ff959bb3b3d7d251f07017b3d1631769b61d12fa7523e8e0c63e0af50029b1df', '69b6146d6aa1e18566b332e46921359c735bbdc570f2adcf7e70618a99cc5bcc', 'ec2dfacb601feb9337a624a46da3e4e57264aa35ab32889aae65cf4aefaeb8bd', '5ec9d17ae6832a960e529f40c730fbb25d1d2e100d0b7be66b218a1dd6a60b69', 'a4acdbdc3df18dbc4894b64b55caa6be889d18774fbaaa17e9ad9a4ec3016f36', 'a082dd131d9e09fe854167bd062cb9a90530cdfc03a1bbed6d31e74e701f2e55', 'ca850f08cd37c45f0ab9887d5cd643390e0f5da341da979ca3f50904fde81881', 'b59222fdd45484f3e19b8ea1e8999d8a398ffebc23da1476cd7dcdadf424ac1d', '974b153bb5192f84812b3ccd97385b90f42fcc10410b18bf2092da524e12cab2', '03a78ae1856c04a4640eee5b8e42934035bf7727311374db4701708c52aa088f', 'c0b45c19e16456866a3eaae233f0bdef4e82b573d4ed97a7b82667f28492e36e', '08431dceaa8bf67b546836d0c8cf3d01e6e5f96ed3b7fa0b885261926436aa97', '08431dceaa8bf67b546836d0c8cf3d01e6e5f96ed3b7fa0b885261926436aa97']"

- Here’s a podcast that I recently did with UT Austin undergraduate Dwarkesh Patel. (As usual, I recommend 2x speed to compensate for my verbal tics.)
- Feel free to use the comments on this post to talk about recent progress in quantum computing or computational complexity! Like, I dunno, a (sub)exponential black-box speedup for the adiabatic algorithm, or anti-concentration for log-depth random quantum circuits, or an improved shadow tomography procedure, or a quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations, or a barrier to proving strong 3-party parallel repetition, or equivalence of one-way functions and time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, or turning any hard-on-average NP problem into one that’s guaranteed to have solutions.

GREs are not required this year because of covid. If you apply to CS and specify that you want to work with me, I’ll be sure to see your application. If you apply to physics or ECE, I won’t see your application, but once you arrive, I can sometimes supervise or co-supervise PhD students in other departments (or, of course, serve on their committees). In any case, everyone in the UT community is extremely welcome at our quantum information group meetings (which are now on Zoom, naturally, but depending on vaccine distribution, hopefully won’t be by the time you arrive!). Emailing me won’t make a difference. Admissions are very competitive, so apply broadly to maximize your chances.
If you’re a prospective postdoctoral fellow: By January 1, 2021, please email me a cover letter, your CV, and two or three of your best papers (links or attachments). Please also ask two recommenders to email me their letters by January 1. While my own work tends toward computational complexity, I’m open to all parts of theoretical quantum computing and information.
If you’re a prospective faculty member: Yes, faculty searches are still happening despite covid! Go here to apply for an opening in the CS department (which, in quantum computing, currently includes me and MIP*=RE superstar John Wright), or here to apply to the physics department (which, in quantum computing, currently includes Drew Potter, along with a world-class condensed matter group).",1683,"['cfda54ea12c99f8272e2025d1023378e96195129c8b4109062c273934fe804b9', '92772b3526cc09ac200dd487c87c7c8160c30a4765026bf8ca93758095355a73', '4a87a547e68721bcfdd8c6d016525d1ed9a01dc6aa852922f90aa8d917f9103b']"

A: It is not possible to use quantum computers to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time.
Q: Why not?
A: Because NP-complete problems are not in BQP.
Q: You’ve just restated your earlier assertion! What I’d like is to understand the underlying reason why not!
A: I’m sorry, but I don’t have time to explain the underlying reason why not.
Q: No offence, but this seems really bogus. I don’t believe you understand the reason why!

61,4886,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4886,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2020-06-30,Scott Aaronson,David Poulin,"2020 sucks.
Yesterday I learned that David Poulin, a creative and widely-beloved quantum computing and information theorist, has died at age 43, of an aggressive brain cancer. After studying under many of the field’s legends—Gilles Brassard, Wojciech Zurek, Ray Laflamme, Gerard Milburn, John Preskill—David became a professor at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec. There he played a leading role in CIFAR (the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research), eventually co-directing its quantum information science program with Aephraim Steinberg. Just this fall (!), David moved to Microsoft Research to start a new phase of his career. He’s survived by a large family.
While I can’t claim any deep knowledge of David’s work—he and I pursued very different problems—it seems appropriate to mention some of his best-known contributions. With David Kribs, Ray Laflamme, and Maia Lesosky, he introduced the formalism of operator quantum error correction, and made many other contributions to the theory of quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance (including the estimation of thresholds). He and coauthors showed in a Nature paper how to do quantum state tomography on 1D matrix product states efficiently. With Pavithran Iyer, he proved that optimal decoding of stabilizer codes is #P-hard.
And if none of that makes a sufficient impression on Shtetl-Optimized readers: well, back in 2013, when D-Wave was claiming to have achieved huge quantum speedups, David Poulin was one of the few experts willing to take a clear skeptical stance in public (including right in my comment section—see here for example).
I vividly remember being officemates with David back in 2003, at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo—before Perimeter had its sleek black building, when it still operated out of a converted tavern. (My and David’s office was in the basement, reached via a narrow staircase.) David liked to tease me: for example, if I found him in conversation with someone else and asked what it was about, he’d say, “oh, nothing to do with computational efficiency, no reason for you to care.” (And yet, much of David’s work ultimately would have to do with computational efficiency.)
David was taken way too soon and will be missed by everyone who knew him.

Quantum Computing Since Democritus, which is already available in English and Russian, is about to be published in both Chinese and Japanese. (So if you read this blog, but have avoided tackling QCSD because your Chinese or Japanese is better than your English, today’s your day!) To go along with the new editions, Cambridge University Press asked me to write a new foreword, reflecting on what happened in the seven years since the book was published. The editor, Paul Dobson, kindly gave me permission to share the new foreword on my blog. So without further ado…
Quantum Computing Since Democritus began its life as a course that I taught at the University of Waterloo in 2006. Seven years later, it became the book that you now hold. Its preface ended with the following words:
Here’s hoping that, in 2020, this book will be as badly in need of revision as the 2006 lecture notes were in 2013.
As I write this, in June 2020, a lot has happened that I would never have predicted in 2013. Donald Trump is the President of the United States, and is up for reelection shortly. This is not a political book, so let me resist the urge to comment further. Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic is ravaging the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people, crashing economies, and shutting down schools and universities (including mine). And in the past few weeks, protests against racism and police brutality started in America and then spread to the world, despite the danger of protesting during a pandemic.
Leaving aside the state of the world, my own life is also very different than it was seven years ago. Along with my family, I’ve moved from MIT to the University of Texas in Austin. My daughter, who was born at almost exactly the same time as Quantum Computing Since Democritus, is now a first-grader, and is joined by a 3-year-old son. When my daughter’s school shut down due to the coronavirus, I began home-schooling her in math, computer science, and physics—in some of the exact same topics covered in this book. I’m now engaged in an experiment to see what portion of this material can be made accessible to a 7-year-old.
But what about the material itself? How has it held up over seven years? Both the bad news and the (for you) good news, I suppose, is that it’s not particularly out of date. The intellectual underpinnings of quantum computing and its surrounding disciplines remain largely as they were. Still, let me discuss what has changed.
Between 2013 and 2020, the field of quantum computing made a striking transition, from a mostly academic pursuit to a major technological arms race. The Chinese government, the US government, and the European Union have all pledged billions of dollars for quantum computing research. Google, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Alibaba, Intel, and Honeywell also now all have well-funded groups tasked with building quantum computers, or providing quantum-computing-related software and services, or even just doing classical computing that’s “quantum-inspired.” These giants are joined by dozens of startups focused entirely on quantum computing.
The new efforts vary greatly in caliber; some efforts seem rooted in visions of what quantum computers will be able to help with, and how soon, that I find to be wildly overoptimistic or even irresponsible. But perhaps it’s always this way when a new technology moves from an intellectual aspiration to a commercial prospect. Having joined the field around 1999, before there were any commercial efforts in quantum computing, I’ve found the change disorienting.
But while some of the new excitement is based on pure hype—on marketers now mixing some “quantum” into their word-salad of “blockchain,” “deep learning,” etc., with no particular understanding of any of the ingredients—there really have been some scientific advances in quantum computing since 2013, a fire underneath the smoke.
Surely the crowning achievement of quantum computing during this period was the achievement of “quantum supremacy,” which a team at Google announced in the fall of 2019. For the first time, a programmable quantum computer was used to outperform any classical computer on earth, running any currently known algorithm. Google’s device, called “Sycamore,” with 53 superconducting qubits cooled to a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero, solved a well-defined albeit probably useless sampling problem in about 3 minutes. To compare, current state-of-the-art simulations on classical computers need a few days, even with hundreds of thousands of parallel processors. Ah, but will a better classical simulation be possible? That’s an open question in quantum complexity! The discussion of that question draws on theoretical work that various colleagues and I did over the past decade. That work in turn draws on my so-called PostBQP=PP theorem from 2004, explained in this book.
In the past seven years, there were also several breakthroughs in quantum computing theory—some of which resolved open problems mentioned in this book.
In 2018, Ran Raz and Avishay Tal gave an oracle relative to which BQP (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time) is not contained in PH (the Polynomial Hierarchy). This solved one of the main open questions, since 1993, about where BQP fits in with classical complexity classes, at least in the black-box setting. (What does that mean? Read the book!) Raz and Tal’s proof used a candidate problem that I had defined in 2009 and called “Forrelation.”
Also in 2018, Urmila Mahadev gave a protocol, based on cryptography, by which a polynomial-time quantum computer (i.e., a BQP machine) could always prove the results of its computation to a classical polynomial-time skeptic, purely by exchanging classical messages with the skeptic. Following Urmila’s achievement, I was delighted to give her a $25 prize for solving the problem that I’d announced on my blog back in 2007.
Perhaps most spectacularly of all, in 2020, Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, and Henry Yuen proved that MIP*=RE. Here MIP* means the class of problems solvable using multi-prover interactive proof systems with quantumly entangled provers (and classical polynomial-time verifiers), while RE means Recursively Enumerable: a class that includes not only all the computable problems, but even the infamous halting problem (!). To say it more simply, entangled provers can convince a polynomial-time verifier that an arbitrary Turing machine halts. Besides its intrinsic interest, a byproduct of this breakthrough was to answer a decades-old question in pure math, the so-called Connes Embedding Conjecture (by refuting the conjecture). To my knowledge, the new result represents the first time that quantum computing has reached “all the way up the ladder of hardness” to touch uncomputable problems. It’s also the first time that non-relativizing techniques, like the ones central to the study of interactive proofs, were ever used in computability theory.
In a different direction, the last seven years have witnessed an astonishing convergence between quantum information and quantum gravity—something that was just starting when Quantum Computing Since Democritus appeared in 2013, and that I mentioned as an exciting new direction. Since then, the so-called “It from Qubit” collaboration has brought together quantum computing theorists with string theorists and former string theorists—experts in things like the black hole information problem—to develop a shared language. One striking proposal that’s emerged from this is a fundamental role for quantum circuit complexity—that is, the smallest number of 1- and 2-qubit gates needed to prepare a given n-qubit state from the all-0 state—in the so-called AdS/CFT (Anti de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory) correspondence. AdS/CFT is a duality between physical theories involving different numbers of spatial dimensions; for more than twenty years, it’s been a central testbed for ideas about quantum gravity. But the duality is extremely nonlocal: a “simple” quantity in the AdS theory, like the volume of a wormhole, can correspond to an incredibly “complicated” quantity in the dual CFT. The new proposal is that the CFT quantity might be not just complicated, but literally circuit complexity itself. Fanciful as that sounds, the truth is that no one has come up with any other proposal that passes the same sanity checks. A related new insight is that the nonlocal mapping between the AdS and CFT theories is not merely analogous to, but literally an example of, a quantum error-correcting code: the same mathematical objects that will be needed to build scalable quantum computers.
When Quantum Computing Since Democritus was first published, some people thought it went too far in elevating computer science, and computational complexity in particular, to fundamental roles in understanding the physical world. But even I wasn’t audacious enough to posit connections like the ones above, which are now more-or-less mainstream in quantum gravity research.
I’m proud that I wrote Quantum Computing Since Democritus, but as the years go by, I find that I have no particular desire to revise it, or even reread it. It seems far better for the book to stand as a record of what I knew and believed and cared about at a certain moment in time.
The intellectual quest that’s defined my life—the quest to wrap together computation, physics, math, and philosophy into some sort of coherent picture of the world—might never end. But it does need to start somewhere. I’m honored that you chose Quantum Computing Since Democritus as a place to start or continue your own quest. I hope you enjoy it.

Three months ago, right before covid shut down the world, the last travel I did was a seven-hour road trip from Austin to Baton Rouge, together with my postdoc Andrea Rocchetto, to deliver something called the Hearne Lecture at the Louisiana State physics department. My topic (unsurprisingly) was Google’s quantum supremacy experiment.
I’d debated whether to cancel the trip, as flying already seemed too dangerous. Dowling was the one who said “why not just drive here with one of your postdocs?”—which turned into a memorable experience for me and Andrea, complete with a personal tour of LIGO and a visit to an alligator hatchery. I had no inkling that it was the last time I’d ever see Jon Dowling, but am now super-glad that we made the visit.
At the dinner after my talk, Dowling was exactly the same as every other time I’d seen him: loud, piss-drunk, obnoxious, and hilarious. He dominated the conversation with stories and jokes, referring in every other sentence either to his Irishness or my Jewishness. His efforts to banter with the waitress, to elicit her deepest opinions about each appetizer and bottle of wine, were so over-the-top that I, sitting next to him, blushed, as if to say, “hey, I’m just the visitor here! I don’t necessarily endorse this routine!”
But Dowling got away with it because, no matter how many taboos he violated per sentence, there was never any hint of malice in it. He was an equal-opportunity offender, with his favorite target being himself. He loved to talk, for example, about my pathological obsession with airy-fairy abstractions, like some kind of “polynomial hierarchy” that hopefully wouldn’t “collapse”—with the punchline being that he, the hardheaded laser physicist, then needed to learn what that meant for his own research.
The quantum computing community of the southern US, not to mention of Twitter and Facebook, and indeed of the entire world, will be poorer without this inimitable, louder-than-life presence.

Here’s Sean’s description of this historic event:
There are some problems for which it’s very hard to find the answer, but very easy to check the answer if someone gives it to you. At least, we think there are such problems; whether or not they really exist is the famous P vs NP problem, and actually proving it will win you a million dollars. This kind of question falls under the rubric of “computational complexity theory,” which formalizes how hard it is to computationally attack a well-posed problem. Scott Aaronson is one of the world’s leading thinkers in computational complexity, especially the wrinkles that enter once we consider quantum computers as well as classical ones. We talk about how we quantify complexity, and how that relates to ideas as disparate as creativity, knowledge vs. proof, and what all this has to do with black holes and quantum gravity.
So, OK, I guess I should also comment on the national disintegration thing. As someone who was once himself the victim of a crazy police overreaction (albeit, trivial compared to what African-Americans regularly deal with), I was moved by the scenes of police chiefs in several American towns taking off their helmets and joining protesters to cheers. Not only is that a deeply moral thing to do, but it serves a practical purpose of quickly defusing the protests. Right now, of course, is an even worse time than usual for chaos in the streets, with a lethal virus still spreading that doesn’t care whether people are congregating for good or for ill. If rational discussion of policy still matters, I support the current push to end the “qualified immunity” doctrine, end the provision of military training and equipment to police, and generally spur the nation’s police to rein in their psychopath minority.",2133,"['b2b69ad44cc8bf9580a6408d1f28feb804886775060f15112a671f418aed0945', 'cbb18b87d2636934eddd5afd9189aa83d15db02f570674420660af668e06024d', 'f48bb0afad7e95803b4379b8e93c3b35b336071d17a2735e146ee6fa2d818988', 'bc78a8a094a46f6b06303217efc190411bbe6795193fb3bd9f276c029e0d7461', 'd4801b000590b54977cee9f056dda71f17b9aa9a369eec1eb238a49b28bb9760', '1b270f0536432a13ed97543a14395be2176fc120de5d73495ea1da5b7fc0f7cf', 'caffef2b60f11d624d8adfd89b605f33fa03b486fdab6aeddd69dd1ec6391b69', '6e0db0ed1f9f5c8236aefc5c6d18328105dceb094cb9bb51b533ca43628193c5', 'ed81add2e2cac1acb73a50659a9d7d62a67a422138dbe3f86957ba8d8e44523c', 'ca785e74ff47a1835b167e69ed54473fd11cab20818d8d1de2195f00b32d9b80', 'fd20941aecec97542c9e6fd262c795aea47051954a0f41c73dd12e314ab83425', '494cfbe86ac385f4f6dd7581164d0c20d3bc8e6147e48ac73322bd3f304dcd26', 'e83149272923e9be1763320663106e1d77efdc267cfb9141c090caca844c1ef1', 'e4a1e709fd6ce0aa25b2e0248a78e13452d10117a11cdc6001f637d9159334b3', '131b04f355ebc2293e3a9f28bcec913e47d6f322120fda04beaa494a9afc560e', 'bc60735b4acbf44b54362f981b197eaa838734cc7f2ebc62690169250fcb0d05', '80865140d50e093cd5680cf50f68631205adffe2bc9efb403d03b45d9c5659e1', '77e4b4070756d380adb36e5f5c4a01e4b091e5ab84e7919034648c5c5011045e', '553354e23825803af100f143229f489952893a3a5a5af57e994b52618aa036cb', '08ee7ae0157ca0e012050ed7d83bebfedf75aeed7cabb92fd9bd1aa03c2e0eb3', '878c3fdcc55ee2cb202f5063489d7a7e300269b426a6e9d640de06bfc766cfd1', 'fb1fd1ce08d6b9f3279c58602578b10c2b2be3ee2b6f1237f1fb0490c097721e', 'e327ac8c71c99ca5d12a060dafdf9846fc6689f01cf94dfc91862b9b2590d807', '79ca5fa02ca98bde9f4a8d4df9919e597dd40a1ba53cec9358997a4f1370db35', 'c44ab69255959e762bbf2f6abe07e1ef02c1dfed20511358cd82d57b4c745221', '72886e8480ba4cedf4aee282a63253008c55c70bbf56812ca6dc524c840253b3', '353a8138a8963316a459d41eacf42c97f872cb19da23c47a4a5109ce580cb78b', 'f1c9b4c33f89da7086c0e9fce8a6024c7f9f5223e5a316bf8db32a6579ef7b91', '9541e6d3e0d5329fbac965c1da6929841d96c098c10c3bbe3b1f33378ee2801c', 'fd314d03e9d197a1e175cde28289e826e05c65ab8f75c4e0c894d3273f4dc6b7']"

Today, with enormous thanks to UT PhD student Corey Ostrove, we’ve gotten the notes into a much better shape (for starters, they’re now in LaTeX). You can see the results here (7MB)—it’s basically a 260-page introductory quantum computing textbook in beta form, covering similar material as many other introductory quantum computing textbooks, but in my style for those who like that. It’s missing exercises, as well as material on quantum supremacy experiments, recent progress in hardware, etc., but that will be added in the next version if there’s enough interest. Enjoy!

66,4794,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4794,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2020-05-13,Scott Aaronson,Four striking papers,"In the past week or two, four striking papers appeared on quant-ph. Rather than doing my usual thing—envisioning a huge, meaty blog post about each paper, but then procrastinating on writing them until the posts are no longer even relevant—I thought I’d just write a paragraph about each paper and then open things up for discussion.
(1) Matt Hastings has announced the first provable superpolynomial black-box speedup for the quantum adiabatic algorithm (in its original, stoquastic version). The speedup is only quasipolynomial (nlog(n)) rather than exponential, and it’s for a contrived example (just like in the important earlier work by Freedman and Hastings, which separated the adiabatic algorithm from Quantum Monte Carlo), and there are no obvious near-term practical implications. But still! Twenty years after Farhi and his collaborators wrote the first paper on the quantum adiabatic algorithm, and 13 years after D-Wave made its first hype-laden announcement, this is (to my mind) the first strong theoretical indication that adiabatic evolution with no sign problem can ever get a superpolynomial speedup over not only simulated annealing, not only Quantum Monte Carlo, but all possible classical algorithms. (This had previously been shown only for a variant of the adiabatic algorithm that jumps up to the first excited state, by Nagaj, Somma, and Kieferova.) As such, assuming the result holds up, Hastings resolves a central question that I (for one) had repeatedly asked about for almost 20 years. Indeed, if memory serves, at an Aspen quantum algorithms meeting a few years ago, I strongly urged Hastings to work on the problem. Congratulations to Matt!
(2) In my 2009 paper “Quantum Copy-Protection and Quantum Money,” I introduced the notion of copy-protected quantum software: a state |ψf⟩ that you could efficiently use to evaluate a function f, but not to produce more states (whether |ψf⟩ or anything else) that would let others evaluate f. I gave candidate constructions for quantumly copy-protecting the simple class of “point functions” (e.g., recognizing a password), and I sketched a proof that quantum copy-protection of arbitrary functions (except for those efficiently learnable from their input/output behavior) was possible relative to a quantum oracle. Building on an idea of Paul Christiano, a couple weeks ago my PhD student Jiahui Liu, Ruizhe Zhang, and I put a preprint on the arXiv improving that conclusion, to show that quantum copy-protection of arbitrary unlearnable functions is possible relative to a classical oracle. But my central open problem remained unanswered: is quantum copy-protection of arbitrary (unlearnable) functions possible in the real world, with no oracle? A couple days ago, Ananth and La Placa put up a preprint where they claim to show that the answer is no, assuming that there’s secure quantum Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) of quantum circuits. I haven’t yet understood the construction, but it looks plausible, and indeed closely related to Barak et al.’s seminal proof of the impossibility of obfuscating arbitrary programs in the classical world. If this holds up, it (conditionally) resolves another of my favorite open problems—indeed, one that I recently mentioned in the Ask-Me-Anything session!
(3) Speaking of Boaz Barak: he, Chi-Ning Chou, and Xun Gao have a new preprint about a fast classical way to spoof Google’s linear cross-entropy benchmark for shallow random quantum circuits (with a bias that degrades exponentially with the depth, remaining detectable up to a depth of say ~√log(n)). As the authors point out, this by no means refutes Google’s supremacy experiment, which involved a larger depth. But along with other recent results in the same direction (e.g. this one), it does show that some exploitable structure is present even in random quantum circuits. Barak et al. achieve their result by simply looking at the marginal distributions on the individual output qubits (although the analysis to show that this works gets rather hairy). Boaz had told me all about this work when I saw him in person—back when traveling and meeting people in person was a thing!—but it’s great to see it up on the arXiv.
(4) Peter and Raphaël Clifford have announced a faster classical algorithm to simulate BosonSampling. To be clear, their algorithm is still exponential-time, but for the special case of a Haar-random scattering matrix, n photons, and m=n input and output modes, it runs in only ~1.69n time, as opposed to the previous bound of ~2n. The upshot is that, if you want to achieve quantum supremacy using BosonSampling, then either you need more photons than previously thought (maybe 90 photons? 100?), or else you need a lot of modes (in our original paper, Arkhipov and I recommended at least m~n2 modes for several reasons, but naturally the experimentalists would like to cut any corners they can).
And what about my own “research program”? Well yesterday, having previously challenged my 7-year-old daughter Lily with instances of comparison sorting, Eulerian tours, undirected connectivity, bipartite perfect matching, stable marriage, factoring, graph isomorphism, unknottedness, 3-coloring, subset sum, and traveling salesman, I finally introduced her to the P vs. NP problem! Even though Lily can’t yet formally define “polynomial,” let alone “algorithm,” I’m satisfied that she understands something of what’s being asked. But, in an unintended echo of one of my more controversial recent posts, Lily insists on pronouncing NP as “nip.”",5546,"['a68d5f26b81b1af72c21e65cb8b6635b0e92a8815ece00cd637e8f3f7af98bfd', '853565bd4c7a6a64718f2bb7e297e5ca4ca38368f26a8def888dcacde2bd9fc5', 'a1e7747596b7081b817570238e31428cf9323093f7faede06b7a100eb3c0b7da', 'ff58f155acf90c17197e3b8e11d7e76204713de9d31c15e2de7a1cbf2fbd3c01', '660212e7d785fc01574aef125753c6609a28be0b8ce6f29b0cb48cd798f7502a', '9c30aee40d17db50bf2fcf8659f5acfa0b9d95549964d3a76620708ca4ad9352', '670d5128e2cb55102497e2b7380fe5cb0f7b0e1abd94e26e7eb66e2d4811d9ff', 'f7768a495fd6f0457a706715a5f1952735b66959510175a1bf3a6f99836f20ec', '91c480aad6327cd630d723e47ffec34606eb7749687949115b686979d6832e15', 'ba8454c2a7b61f8b544081f32dc29785e6b2e15add737a2e75402f3322615168', '25c30fa6e70a16625bfb3ae74d81f11323d932434fa700bb33258a21890fa557', 'd1509efd6396bdcb22ddd9d3d709aa66110963be435eafd0edc59ae4eaf1c367', '0ef524a8d897d6302d79a5f45d3c08d331bad57fcbd23b52c30fe8a356413475', '9b0853bc09e3143407f90227e8f844e63e55af213145813e678dd0018e4b2b32', '9a11628c73ad00ca0ca44f1e594040c7ad8adb306a43b263f1ef67e705ba7a7b', '42eee56ff34891d3680a93d39e18f226784c19522fab2bd5b639692ae3d32901', '1ff791052bf62cad7ff2dc13b37e26374eea40ab94dd85642c2e4ea4f78170b5', 'b3b5a6d7c6bd1212b52fe0619424a779af82a4d8628a564ea199fc19e3d15078', '4edb7a2be8ebd2b170193b01f7fa07418e8672b639f9644a8fc82622a10caad8', '14e8c8f505796cece7f92d9cd0e12caac12a55fffdde1005d3a2d1b7284bf9c3', '643404f435f5c5b2d1f3b18c381e06177f21a12485cfa505c543a8f8b12f8175', '4a8b1b03b186f5bf2cd45a00e0c63e9db58d1f239b8b843916ebea3f7fa4fd5f', '958443ddecc1ab52a72cfa6d7600420def1a2a00618cc7697f7bad87d9d75c81', '6e0faac6ebb3db96505261c58954edc5d71ae66d2a95ad1290494b1550ec3730', '20ff056ffdee401f254d8824a404b0b7eef201a544f24222b8775fd5ec6ad2cc']"

Even though there were many, many bugs to be worked out, I found giving my first talk in virtual reality a fascinating experience; thanks so much to Patrick V. for inviting me and setting it up.
(1) I’ll be giving an online talk at SlateStarCodex (actually, in a VR room where you can walk around with your avatar, mingle, and even try to get “front-row seating”), this coming Sunday at 10:30am US Pacific time = 12:30pm US Central time (i.e., me) = 1:30pm US Eastern time = … Here’s the abstract:
Schrödinger’s Cat and Quantum Necromancy
I’ll try, as best I can, to give a 10-minute overview of the century-old measurement problem of quantum mechanics. I’ll then discuss a new result, by me and Yosi Atia, that might add a new wrinkle to the problem. Very roughly, our result says that if you had the technological ability, as measured by (say) quantum circuit complexity, to prove that a cat was in a coherent superposition of the alive and dead states, then you’d necessarily also have the technological ability to bring a dead cat back to life. Of course, this raises the question of in what sense such a cat was ever “dead” in the first place.
(2) Robin Kothari has a beautiful blog post about a new paper by me, him, Avishay Tal, and Shalev Ben-David, which uses Huang’s recent breakthrough proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture to show that D(f)=O(Q(f)4) for all total Boolean functions f, where D(f) is the deterministic query complexity of f and Q(f) is the quantum query complexity—thereby resolving another longstanding open problem (the best known relationship since 1998 had been D(f)=O(Q(f)6)). Check out his post!
(3) For all the people who’ve been emailing me, and leaving blog comments, about Stephen Wolfram’s new model of fundamental physics (his new new kind of science?)—Adam Becker now has an excellent article for Scientific American, entitled Physicists Criticize Stephen Wolfram’s “Theory of Everything.” The article quotes me, friend-of-the-blog Daniel Harlow, and several others. The only thing about Becker’s piece that I disagreed with was the amount of space he spent on process (e.g. Wolfram’s flouting of traditional peer review). Not only do I care less and less about such things, but I worry that harping on them feeds directly into Wolfram’s misunderstood-genius narrative. Why not use the space to explain how Wolfram makes a hash of quantum mechanics—e.g., never really articulating how he proposes to get unitarity, or the Born rule, or even a Hilbert space? Anyway, given the demand, I guess I’ll do a separate blog post about this when I have time. (Keep in mind that, with my kids home from school, I have approximately 2 working hours per day.)
(4) Oh yeah, I forgot! Joshua Zelinsky pointed me to a website by Martin Ugarte, which plausibly claims to construct a Turing machine with only 748 states whose behavior is independent of ZF set theory—beating the previous claimed record of 985 states due to Stefan O’Rear (see O’Rear’s GitHub page), which in turn beat the 8000 states of me and Adam Yedidia (see my 2016 blog post about this). I should caution that, to my knowledge, the new construction hasn’t been peer-reviewed, let alone proved correct in a machine-checkable way (well, the latter hasn’t yet been done for any of these constructions). For that matter, while an absolutely beautiful interface is provided, I couldn’t even find documentation for the new construction.

One of the only things that makes it bearable—even though in some sense it shouldn’t—is that most of humanity is in this together. For once, there’s no question of “why me?”
- Having watched the eighth and final episode of Devs, the thought occurred to me: if I’d had the opportunity to restart the world from 8 months ago, even inside a simulation, I’d seize the chance and never look back.
- I think I finally figured out how to explain the issue with Devs to my literary sophisticate readers. Namely: Devs consists, precisely, of the cultural appropriation of quantum computing. Now, I never felt like cultural appropriation was the world’s worst problem—not even before a pandemic started overflowing the morgues—so I wouldn’t say I was offended by Alex Garland appropriating the images and buzzwords of my quantum computing tribe for a basically unrelated purpose, but it is what it is. Again: Devs is the show for you, if you want a haunting, slow-paced, well-produced meditation about free will and determinism and predicting the future and parallel worlds and “what if the whole universe is a simulation?,” and the various ideas I would’ve had about such topics around the age of 11. It’s just not a show about quantum computing. I hope that makes it clear.
- I read with interest this anonymous but PGP-signed article, laying out the case that it’s plausible that covid accidentally leaked from either the Wuhan Institute of Virology or the Wuhan CDC, rather than originating at the Huanan seafood market. Or, as an intermediate hypothesis, that an infected animal from one of those labs ended up at the seafood market. (Note that this is completely different from the hypothesis that covid was purposefully engineered—the authors of the article find that totally implausible, and I agree with them.) Notably, the Wuhan labs are known to have experimented with bat coronaviruses very much like covid, and are known to have performed “gain-of-function” experiments on them, and were probably the central labs in China for such experiments. And viruses are known to have leaked from other labs in China on other occasions, and the nature → seafood market route has unresolved issues, like where exactly the crossover from bats to pangolins (or some other intermediate species) is supposed to have happened, such that people would only start getting infected at the seafood market and not at its faraway suppliers, and … well, anyway, read the article and form your own judgment!
- I find it interesting that three months ago, I would’ve hesitated even to share such a link, because my internal critic would’ve screamed “this looks too much like tinfoil-hat stuff—are you ready for all the people you respect sneering at you?” But the me of three months ago is not the me of today. I make no apologies for adapting my thoughts to the freak branch of the multiverse where I actually find myself.",2937,"['e3c46198982bf555be8655b992efd692b2c499771340f96b7ad56ed4f6a98867', 'a501e280884064f97a23d6d1f9deef6654cf2bab0f321c388c96d438efa3edba', '62b85c834c5ea11cbb183d8067717fd23e25646f501f4cd1b2918e2ee88cad18', '78cfbd03c4354dfeaf1bf1da57bb71d817221cf66cc6c5a392b05eec16927743', 'a9064c753dc996de9e27e2f30c6b498e43d339785f7c9b51360acd4d9ff37ea8', '2c5a255e3b6225d7e6cbfccaf886bc2b695bee31f5929ec3a4caa44f00122d4d', '0de23d86c60dbbcfc49fe300bd3f904799f68965cc59dc485e0aef0ebd7b9293', '0dce4c07ec1f2db29e2cacd7751a85ee394d2cc078fe441ce5531b6d9e4e3959', 'd643de730fd21abec3f5a3777f94fce320f899849f609cb89d937712b7f3faf3', 'eb79945e33d11688657410708a42a9e0c5b892ccbd9c7718829ddbf4ef0548be', 'fff4408ce25e6a137bbaf484b31309d2c5838897418b6b954f8dee5d3f4fa33d', 'b3e1d4c87cb7f59e674ede331c3dda7c278338f4556cf7a86b3564ab65a19c03', 'ec4377895b7e61c420d313f4506c42d42c531b46e49040c0b988f243d818a2c3', '16eaa29b3b1be793b8469fa3be95c82ebd3f8373baf53a52b2bc742088af8e85', '1ddaf5f889ea3f8fce6eaa718adfede604543c99687acee93d3c1ae737eb4a83', 'd8ee571637404f7368757a2a3a4a48672c27f117556428d3fd18f04a6a8377b6', 'b8203997bfe103843003bbb33e1bc65b4be61d4635b2e7edd48185360e1dc65e', '82b68e21ef8d3f80295041d24a52ddb0f75c6c0373ce54467ee8eef6ed969687', 'e883dd5206652492f364f37cd01940790e2b4cc1bdd9030015c301a957ca2453', '0447a638d92c096438450b66739463de59026028e44397d60153bb5b8a1c7d8c', '5db392e2e73696345ad6a9dbf6162647ce9d75084a5d0704de3c5bd54ea0ae78', '7a251f9e446d9ec299d7ed544237851494c3087d97a063b6963957a042e1c5c0', '7a97dc6aafe6cf2a38dbdf0bbc15e188d196d537e542e168ae04a7c4728ff372', '55d13e248a9b9df34544f44caac9c4c4ae5af335c82d2c03f5720c4df0a6db2f', '34554d4ffe3ee42347844d71577a53d3eb76625ef93b02ec6b516b8c12775cbf', 'eabcdd4f8d0cb7887c7d6c15afb7d67851bf54826c8790592a91dd401418ee95', '77f6df66bdd17f17c3b0c308d14a65ff7186897e0230e4d881ebe3a047230a14', '13499ee7db89994068ce761a23f7eaaf82461ae694d0dcec0110fb0fdafcca15', '7d162380c9bf717aa1f58d3930afb20d024d295776755600746031e1f1573743', 'a7da9afa45b00cc1b97edcd4bdf04e024c1da669407a250e9cda37bea9c162e0', '9bd961ebaff2fd3f14c9c9eee92d0279395096690f4b790e82d6b2d2299fc39a', '5cdf135af17f32d3c3162be22eaf177af5bc729dd791be0e9687880479c7a5d8', 'd48a7088d3ea7b9ac94efd1846b610cccda646f2aadedd14c576ba0983aed4ae', '378418177db2aeda94406105b64558691087e3a4c536e18d7f9fd4c2b1189c58', '3c9fa545afeafb14f87e9209a93c17d80bfb6f335925fccc0674237b3781a9e6', '136a39370ade4c10e72177fac416551d6c80dacef8b8aafecaa9cef6d944b841', '462a1f35c0ff867cfeed2e8ef1d30368c5821840bb1ac0358dd03562bb759c4a', '73d950bc63cb9dc0de07d543bd88030a4560477a4b974d74570ca533238f8ea4', '43ddbba425897e4ded3e22e77ea93c9f61bddae8b564211fbfbb8e89b340a67e', 'ff8851c5b2bb9daa8176b5e4267cee6369a1e67272cb6324bba3df32f7d160d4']"

Or rather, it’s related only insofar as it’s about a Hulu miniseries, the sort of thing that many of us have more occasion to watch while holed up at home.
Three weeks ago, a journalist named Ben Lindbergh—who’d previously asked me to comment on the scientific accuracy of Avengers: Endgame—asked me the same question about the miniseries Devs, which I hadn’t previously heard of.
[Warning: Spoilers follow]
‘Devs,’ I learned, is a spooky sci-fi action thriller about a secretive Silicon Valley company that builds a quantum computer that can perfectly reconstruct the past, down to what Jesus looked like on the cross, and can also (at least up to a point) predict the future.
And I was supposed, not only to endure such a show, but to comment on the accuracy of its invocations of quantum computing? This didn’t sound promising.
But, y’know, I was at home quarantined. So I agreed to watch the first episode. Which quickly turned into the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh episodes (the eighth and final one isn’t out yet).
It turns out that ‘Devs’ isn’t too bad, except that it’s not particularly about quantum computers. The latter is simply a buzzword chosen by the writers for a plot concept that would’ve been entirely familiar to the ancient Greeks, who called it the Delphic Oracle. You know, the mysterious entity that prophesies your fate, so then you try to escape the prophecy, but your very evasive maneuvers make the prophecy come true? Picture that, except with qubits—and for some reason, in a gleaming golden laboratory that has components that float in midair.
At this point, I’ll just link you to Ben Lindbergh’s article about the show: Making Sense of the Science and Philosophy of ‘Devs.’ His long and excellent piece quotes me extensively enough that I see no need also to analyze the show in this blog post. (It also quotes several academic philosophers.)
Instead, I’ll just share a few tidbits that Ben left out, but that might be amusing to quantum computing fans.
- The first episode opens with a conversation between two characters about how even “elliptical curve” cryptography is insecure against attack by quantum computers. So I immediately knew both that the writers had one or more consultants who actually knew something about QC, and also that those consultants were not as heavily involved as they could’ve been.
- Similarly: in a later scene, some employees at the secretive company hold what appears to be a reading group about Shor’s algorithm. They talk about waves that interfere and cancel each other out, which is great, but beyond that their discussion sounded to me like nonsense. In particular, their idea seemed to be that the waves would reinforce at the prime factors p and q themselves, rather than at inverse multiples of the period of a periodic function that only indirectly encodes the factoring problem. (What do you say: should we let this one slide?)
- “How many qubits does this thing have?” “A number that there would be no point in describing as a number.” ROFL
- In the show, a crucial break comes when the employees abandon a prediction algorithm based on the deBroglie-Bohm pilot wave interpretation, and substitute one based on Everett’s many-worlds interpretation. Which I could actually almost believe, except that the many-worlds interpretation seems to contradict the entire premise of the rest of the show?
- A new employee, after he sees the code of the superpowerful quantum computer for the first time, is so disoriented and overwhelmed that he runs and vomits into a toilet. I, too, have had that reaction to the claims of certain quantum computing companies, although in some sense for the opposite reason.
Anyway, none of the above addresses the show’s central conceit: namely, that the Laplace demon can be made real, the past and future rendered fully knowable (with at most occasional breaks and exceptions) by a machine that’s feasible to build. This conceit is fascinating to explore, but also false.
In the past, if you’d asked me to justify its falsity, I would’ve talked about chaos, and quantum mechanics, and the unknowability of the fine details of the universe’s state; I might’ve even pointed you to my Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine essay. I also would’ve mentioned the severe conceptual difficulties in forcing Nature to find a fixed-point of a universe where you get to see your own future and act on that information (these difficulties are just a variant of the famous Grandfather Paradox).
But it occurs to me that, just as the coronavirus has now made plain the nature of exponential growth, even to the world’s least abstract-minded person, so too it’s made plain the universe’s unpredictability.

70,4649,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4649,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2020-03-05,Scott Aaronson,Turn down the quantum volume,"Several people asked me to comment on the recent announcement by Honeywell that they’ll soon have what they call “the most powerful” quantum computer (see here for press release, here for Forbes article, here for paper).
I’m glad that Honeywell, which many people might know as an air-conditioner manufacturer, has entered the race for trapped-ion QC. I wish them success. I’ve known about what they were doing in part because Drew Potter, my friend and colleague in UT Austin’s physics department, took a one-year leave from UT to contribute to their effort.
Here I wanted to comment about one detail in Honeywell’s announcement: namely, the huge emphasis on “quantum volume” as the central metric for judging quantum computing progress, and the basis for calling their own planned device the “most powerful.” One journalist asked me to explain why quantum volume is such an important measure. I had to give her an honest answer: I don’t know whether it is.
Quantum volume was invented a few years ago by a group at IBM. According to one of their papers, it can be defined roughly as 2k, where k is the largest number such that you can run a k-qubit random quantum circuit, with depth k and with any-to-any connectivity, and have at least (say) 2/3 probability of measuring an answer that passes some statistical test. (In the paper, they use what Lijie Chen and I named Heavy Output Generation, though Google’s Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark is similar.)
I don’t know why IBM takes the “volume” to be 2k rather than k itself. Leaving that aside, though, the idea was to invent a single “goodness measure” for quantum computers that can’t be gamed either by building a huge number of qubits that don’t maintain nearly enough coherence (what one might call “the D-Wave approach”), or by building just one perfect qubit, or by building qubits that behave well in isolation but don’t interact easily. Note that the any-to-any connectivity requirement makes things harder for architectures with nearest-neighbor interactions only, like the 2D superconducting chips being built by Google, Rigetti, or IBM itself.
You know the notion of a researcher’s h-index—defined as the largest h such that she’s published h papers that garnered h citations each? Quantum volume is basically an h-index for quantum computers. It’s an attempt to take several different yardsticks of experimental progress, none terribly useful in isolation, and combine them into one “consumer index.”
Certainly I sympathize with the goal of broadening people’s focus beyond the “but how many qubits does it have?” question—since the answer to that question is meaningless without further information about what the qubits can do. From that standpoint, quantum volume seems like a clear step in the right direction.
Alas, Goodhart’s Law states that “as soon as a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” That happened years ago with the h-index, which now regularly pollutes academic hiring and promotion decisions, to the point where its inventor expressed regrets. Quantum volume is now looking to me like another example of Goodhart’s Law at work.
The position of Honeywell’s PR seems to be that, if they can build a device that can apply 6 layers of gates to 6 qubits, with full connectivity and good fidelity, that will then count as “the world’s most powerful quantum computer,” since it will have the largest volume. One problem here is that such a device could be simulated by maintaining a vector of only 26=64 amplitudes. This is nowhere near quantum supremacy (i.e., beating classical computers at some well-defined task), which is a necessary though not sufficient condition for doing anything useful.
Think of a university that achieves an average faculty-to-student ratio of infinity by holding one class with zero students. It gets the “best score” only by exploiting an obvious defect in the scoring system.
So what’s the alternative? The policy I prefer is simply to tell the world all your system specs, as clearly as you can, with no attempts made to bury the lede. How many qubits do you have? With what coherence times? With what connectivity? What are the 1- and 2-qubit gate fidelities? What depth of circuit can you do? What resources do the standard classical algorithms need to simulate your system? Most importantly: what’s the main drawback of your system, the spec that’s the worst, the one you most need to improve? What prevents you from having a scalable quantum computer right now? And are you going to tell me, or will you make me scour Appendix III.B in your paper, or worse yet, ask one of your competitors?
I confess that the answers to the above questions are hard to summarize in a single number (unless you, like, concatenated binary encodings of them or something). But they can be ineffably combined, to produce a progress metric that one of my postdocs suggested calling “quantum scottness,” and which roughly equals the number of expressions of wide-eyed surprise minus the number of groans.",5018,"['ec60a4b6eb5f3fee30c8cdd212d072db71576e526605428a4ae2c4811c2cb1de', 'a06ba917c2a4346997f7d0e1dead35d943e1e541c49f19e07f64af51b4b6e078', '2865d22f47626e1c42c09637230cdfd8ddb35b17c2e834ecb04b3c043adc238b', 'bb70ef8c5de792e9aeb441b44dff826252b60928027f5ba53c018cdd02226cbb', 'e080a21c98919fb381398fdbcc996eb12913d738efdfc2351ea1d793b90d7239', 'cd1e2abb420c09c6d5c2d52850c46f72094b1eee97287d87bbe9395bd4c634f9', '79c5ff399d1a893e05005a9d882a3df471972e9ff711e779a54b1da947095602', '1ca5245a68f7b693c481bd012b6892f2ab858dd4043d7e50ae87ff4bb6ee9f1e', '76ec504c5324810ce7a3c77c721bb44db9eecbdb2bee6600789f2434b3ce6387', 'a0fdc27a9ce3ea8e9dd8953e1ad87da5f4b962adc958eaed6d9707f216afaa2e', '3c3cee8191e9213a0428e0eddcafb04d9c78b239220534d28eadb7bf411eb763', '3e2133c0d94719f24910838e93f6e5fecd7172ea2fdd1ef954abeac60fdd4f42', '9b6a453ddbe3ec073535136e5e5c0ed280ee826ad2a3925b8f7b4c87dcc7ef35', '8352e1d324bb3ae0f2eac23b4abc6a7d3723a06f348fe212d18bc1ce502fe8dc', 'f79bf3da4e474f16fd66e093840e868c506c5f698deab7237e718d8d4d917935', 'f05fea1c2e28f0e58bb5b01fe64e113f45f61eadd21386f620d71b427cdbe4a3', '912c2cf04255fc688051d1d50658930b37d08f08c80eb7fdcc9c3a1c176cebac', 'a1dbcf4c773087731d1c52e2fd67dbec79de35ea78365d58ee166951bad98797', 'd7be5b669154e857fd1a790f9963ca6afa2d70f22a73727c850550ad230d3d38', '8b77a740fb7305992bacfbc2badd4814da6bc605243ea0b4930df8dac4e24511', 'c555806347617c6372e91d22c7caa18fc9458021c44129071539849284bae92b']"
71,4635,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4635,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2020-03-03,Scott Aaronson,Paperz,"Soon, all anyone will want to talk about is quarantines, food shortages, N95 masks, the suspension of universities and of scientific conferences. (As many others have pointed out, this last might actually be a boon to scientific productivity—as it was for a young Isaac Newton when Cambridge was closed for the bubonic plague, so Newton went home and invented calculus and mechanics.)
Anyway, before that all happens, I figured I’d get in a last post about quantum information and complexity theory progress.
Hsin-Yuan Huang, Richard Kueng, and John Preskill have a nice preprint entitled Predicting Many Properties of a Quantum System from Very Few Measurements. In it they take shadow tomography, which I proposed a couple years ago, and try to bring it closer to practicality on near-term devices, by restricting to the special case of non-adaptive, one-shot measurements, on separate copies of the state ρ that you’re trying to learn about. They show that this is possible using a number of copies that depends logarithmically on the number of properties you’re trying to learn (the optimal dependence), not at all on the Hilbert space dimension, and linearly on a new “shadow norm” quantity that they introduce.
Rahul Ilango, Bruno Loff, and Igor Oliveira announced the pretty spectacular-sounding result that the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) is NP-complete for multi-output functions—that is, for Boolean functions f with not only many input bits but many outputs. Given the 2n-sized truth table of a Boolean function f:{0,1}n→{0,1}, the original MCSP simply asks for the size of the smallest Boolean circuit that computes f. This problem was studied in the USSR as early as the 1950s; whether it’s NP-complete has stood for decades as one of the big open problems of complexity theory. We’ve known that if you could quickly solve MCSP then you could also invert any one-way function, but we’ve also known technical barriers to going beyond that to a flat-out NP-hardness result, at least via known routes. Before seeing this paper, I’d never thought about whether MCSP for many-output functions might somehow be easier to classify, but apparently it is!
Hamoon Mousavi, Seyed Nezhadi, and Henry Yuen have now taken the MIP*=RE breakthrough even a tiny step further, by showing that “zero-gap MIP*” (that is, quantum multi-prover interactive proofs with an arbitrarily small gap between the completeness and soundness probabilities) takes you even beyond the halting problem (i.e., beyond Recursively Enumerable or RE), and up to the second level of the arithmetical hierarchy (i.e., to the halting problem for Turing machines with oracles for the original halting problem). This answers a question that someone asked in the comments section of this blog.
Several people asked me for comment on the paper What limits the simulation of quantum computers?, by Yiqing Zhou, Miles Stoudenmire, and Xavier Waintal. In particular, does this paper refute or weaken Google’s quantum supremacy claim, as the paper does not claim to do (but, rather coyly, also does not claim not to do)? Short answer: No, it doesn’t, or not now anyway.
Longer, more technical answer: The quoted simulation times, just a few minutes for quantum circuits with 54 qubits and depth 20, assume Controlled-Z gates rather than iSWAP-like gates. Using tensor network methods, the classical simulation cost with the former is roughly the square root of the simulation cost with the latter (~2k versus ~4k for some parameter k related to the depth). As it happens, Google switched its hardware from Controlled-Z to iSWAP-like gates a couple years ago precisely because they realized this—I had a conversation about it with Sergio Boixo at the time. Once this issue is accounted for, the quoted simulation times in the new paper seem to be roughly in line with what was previously reported by, e.g., Johnnie Gray and Google itself.
Oh yeah, I enjoyed Quantum Homeopathy Works. Cool result, and the title is actually a pretty accurate description of the contents.
To end with a community announcement: as many of you might know, the American Physical Society’s March Meeting, which was planned for this week in Denver, was abruptly cancelled due to the coronavirus (leaving thousands of physicists out their flights and hotel rooms—many had even already arrived there). However, my colleague Michael Biercuk kindly alerted me to a “virtual March Meeting” that’s been set up online, with recorded talks and live webinars. Even after the pandemic passes, is this a model that we should increasingly move to? I wouldn’t have thought so ten or fifteen years ago, but today every schlep across the continent brings me a step closer to shouting “yes”…",4720,"['f6bd1855b325cb6052e2b8b0cc481cc79d5971df6e63c7e1a440e926e24d34a8', '341f5ec91e863dbf73955ec3693c1948fccd8782a2981e8998562d0c9e9101a0', 'd11680046e5facf439c500475ca1df19b357c788773614d00fb3fe9846e4ec15', '55311d6f44b54157e5e2b0854f6c6517a5f8cca1cf05437ca0c9bd28886df2dd', 'c717672f9367ee057dab48715a9e72928b857bf7384edb380650d9e828710d8a', '8bb7f7a43dca948e7dbafd3b7094c670c6fb1edb68634f0269218a7b5d35d97d', '437369f12a4ab280e0cd9796ab7e58d1be410a5a6c35a738af3213440106a5a5']"
72,4626,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4626,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2020-02-29,Scott Aaronson,Freeman Dyson and Boris Tsirelson,"Today, as the world braces for the possibility of losing millions of lives to the new coronavirus—to the hunger for pangolin meat, of all things (combined with the evisceration of competent public health agencies like the CDC)—we also mourn the loss of two incredibly special lives, those of Freeman Dyson (age 96) and Boris Tsirelson (age 69).
Freeman Dyson was sufficiently legendary, both within and beyond the worlds of math and physics, that there’s very little I can add to what’s been said. It seemed like he was immortal, although I’d heard from mutual friends that his health was failing over the past year. When I spent a year as a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study, in 2004-5, I often sat across from Dyson in the common room, while he drank tea and read the news. That I never once struck up a conversation with him is a regret that I’ll now carry with me forever.
My only exchange with Dyson came when he gave a lecture at UC Berkeley, about how life might persist infinitely far into the future, even after the last stars had burnt out, by feeding off steadily dimishing negentropy flows in the nearly-thermal radiation. During the Q&A, I challenged Dyson that his proposal seemed to assume an analog model of computation. But, I asked, once we took on board the quantum-gravity insights of Jacob Bekenstein and others, suggesting that nature behaves like a (quantum) digital computer at the Planck scale, with at most ~1043 operations per second and ~1069 qubits per square meter and so forth, wasn’t this sort of proposal ruled out? “I’m not going to argue with you,” was Dyson’s response. Yes, he’d assumed an analog computational model; if computation was digital then that surely changed the picture.
Sometimes—and not just with his climate skepticism, but also (e.g.) with his idea that general relativity and quantum mechanics didn’t need to be reconciled, that it was totally fine for the deepest layer of reality to be a patchwork of inconsistent theories—Dyson’s views struck me as not merely contrarian but as a high-level form of trolling. Even so, Dyson’s book Disturbing the Universe had had a major impact on me as a teenager, for the sparkling prose as much as for the ideas.
With Dyson’s passing, the scientific world has lost one of its last direct links to a heroic era, of Einstein and Oppenheimer and von Neumann and a young Richard Feynman, when theoretical physics stood at the helm of civilization like never before or since. Dyson, who apparently remained not only lucid but mathematically powerful (!) well into his last year, clearly remembered when the Golden Age of science fiction looked like simply sober forecasting; when the smartest young people, rather than denouncing each other on Twitter, dreamed of scouting the solar system in thermonuclear-explosion-powered spacecraft and seriously worked to make that happen.
Boris Tsirelson (homepage, Wikipedia), who emigrated from the Soviet Union and then worked at Tel Aviv University (where my wife Dana attended his math lectures), wasn’t nearly as well known as Dyson to the wider world, but was equally beloved within the quantum computing and information community. Tsirelson’s bound, which he proved in the 1980s, showed that even quantum mechanics could only violate the Bell inequality by so much and by no more, could only let Alice and Bob win the CHSH game with probability cos2(π/8). This seminal result anticipated many of the questions that would only be asked decades later with the rise of quantum information. Tsirelson’s investigations of quantum nonlocality also led him to pose the famous Tsirelson’s problem: loosely speaking, can all sets of quantum correlations that can arise from an infinite amount of entanglement, be arbitrarily well approximated using finite amounts of entanglement? The spectacular answer—no—was only announced one month ago, as a corollary of the MIP*=RE breakthrough, something that Tsirelson happily lived to see although I don’t know what his reaction was (update: I’m told that he indeed learned of it in his final weeks, and was happy about it). Sadly, for some reason, I never met Tsirelson in person, although I did have lively email exchanges with him 10-15 years ago about his problem and other topics. This amusing interview with Tsirelson gives some sense for his personality (hat tip to Gil Kalai, who knew Tsirelson well).

In the meantime, there are also interviews! See, for example, this 5-minute one on Texas Standard (an NPR affiliate), where I’m asked about the current state of quantum computing in the US, in light of the Trump administration’s recent proposal to give a big boost to quantum computing and AI research, even while slashing and burning basic science more broadly. I made some critical comments—for example, about the need to support the whole basic research ecosystem (I pointed out that “quantum computing can’t thrive in isolation”), and also about the urgent need to make it feasible for the best researchers from around the world to get US visas and green cards. Unfortunately, those parts seem to have been edited out, in favor of my explanations of basic points about quantum computing.
More Updates:
There was a discussion on Twitter of the ethics of the “Quantum Bullshit Detector” Twitter feed—which dishes out vigilante justice, like some dark and troubled comic-book hero, by rendering anonymous, unexplained, unaccountable, very often correct albeit not infallible verdicts of “Bullshit” or “Not Bullshit” on claimed quantum information advances. As part of that discussion, Christopher Savoie wrote:
[Criticizing] is what we do in science. [But not calling] “bullshit” anonymously and without any accountability. Look at Scott Aaronson’s blog. He takes strong positions. But as Scott. I respect that.
What do people think: should “He takes strong positions. But as Scott.” be added onto the Shtetl-Optimized header bar?

See this comment for more.
Update: If you’re interested in the above topic, then you should probably stop reading this post right now, and switch to this better post by Thomas Vidick, one of the authors of the new breakthrough. (Or this by Boaz Barak or this by Lance Fortnow or this by Ken Regan.) (For background, also see Thomas Vidick’s excellent piece for the AMS Notices.)
Still here? Alright, alright…
Here’s the paper, which weighs in at 165 pages. The authors are Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, my former postdoc Thomas Vidick, John Wright (who will be joining the CS faculty here at UT Austin this fall), and my wife Dana’s former student Henry Yuen. Rather than pretending that I can provide intelligent commentary on this opus in the space of a day, I’ll basically just open my comment section to discussion and quote the abstract:
We show that the class MIP* of languages that can be decided by a classical verifier interacting with multiple all-powerful quantum provers sharing entanglement is equal to the class RE of recursively enumerable languages. Our proof builds upon the quantum low-degree test of (Natarajan and Vidick, FOCS 2018) by integrating recent developments from (Natarajan and Wright, FOCS 2019) and combining them with the recursive compression framework of (Fitzsimons et al., STOC 2019).
An immediate byproduct of our result is that there is an efficient reduction from the Halting Problem to the problem of deciding whether a two-player nonlocal game has entangled value 1 or at most 1/2. Using a known connection, undecidability of the entangled value implies a negative answer to Tsirelson’s problem: we show, by providing an explicit example, that the closure Cqa of the set of quantum tensor product correlations is strictly included in the set Cqc of quantum commuting correlations. Following work of (Fritz, Rev. Math. Phys. 2012) and (Junge et al., J. Math. Phys. 2011) our results provide a refutation of Connes’ embedding conjecture from the theory of von Neumann algebras.
To say it differently (in response to a commenter’s request), some of the major implications are as follows.
(1) There is a protocol by which two entangled provers can convince a polynomial-time verifier of the answer to any computable problem whatsoever (!!), or indeed that a given Turing machine halts.
(2) There is a two-prover game, analogous to the Bell/CHSH game, for which Alice and Bob can do markedly better with a literally infinite amount of entanglement than they can with any finite amount of entanglement.
(3) There is no algorithm even to approximate the entangled value of a two-prover game (i.e., the probability that Alice and Bob win the game, if they use the best possible strategy and as much entanglement as they like). Instead, this problem is equivalent to the halting problem.
(4) There are types of correlations between Alice and Bob that can be produced using infinite entanglement, but that can’t even be approximated using any finite amount of entanglement.
(5) The Connes embedding conjecture, a central conjecture from the theory of operator algebras dating back to the 1970s, is false.
Note that all of these implications—including the ones for pure math and the foundations of quantum physics—were obtained using tools that originated in theoretical computer science, specifically the study of interactive proof systems.
I can remember when the class MIP* was first defined and studied, back around 2003, and people made the point that we didn’t know any reasonable upper bound on the class’s power—not NEXP, not NEEEEXP, not even the set of all computable languages. Back then, the joke was how far our proof techniques were from what was self-evidently the truth. I don’t remember a single person who seriously contemplated that two entangled provers could convince a polynomial-time verifier than an arbitrary Turing machine halts.
Still, ever since Natarajan and Wright’s NEEXP in MIP* breakthrough last year, all of us in quantum computing theory knew that MIP*=RE was a live possibility—and all through the summer and fall, I heard many hints that such a breakthrough was imminent.
It’s worth pointing out that, with only classical correlations between the provers, MIP gives “merely” the power of NEXP (Nondeterministic Exponential Time), while with arbitrary non-signalling correlations between the provers, the so-called MIPns gives the power of EXP (Deterministic Exponential Time). So it’s particularly striking that quantum entanglement, which is “intermediate” between classical correlations and arbitrary non-signalling correlations, yields such wildly greater computational power than either of those two.
The usual proviso applies: when I’ve blogged excitedly about preprints with amazing new results, most have stood, but at least two ended up being retracted. Still, assuming this one stands (as I’m guessing it will), I regard it as easily one of the biggest complexity-theoretic (and indeed computability-theoretic!) surprises so far in this century. Huge congratulations to the authors on what looks to be a historic achievement.

76,4447,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4447,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2019-12-28,Scott Aaronson,Quantum computing motte-and-baileys,"In the wake of two culture-war posts—the first on the term “quantum supremacy,” the second on the acronym “NIPS”—it’s clear that we all need to cool off with something anodyne and uncontroversial. Fortunately, this holiday season, I know just the thing to bring everyone together: groaning about quantum computing hype!
When I was at the Q2B conference in San Jose, I learned about lots of cool stuff that’s happening in the wake of Google’s quantum supremacy announcement. I heard about the 57-qubit superconducting chip that the Google group is now building, following up on its 53-qubit one; and also about their first small-scale experimental demonstration of my certified randomness protocol. I learned about recent progress on costing out the numbers of qubits and gates needed to do fault-tolerant quantum simulations of useful chemical reactions (IIRC, maybe a hundred thousand qubits and a few hours’ worth of gates—scary, but not Shor’s algorithm scary).
I also learned about two claims about quantum algorithms that startups have made, and which are being wrongly interpreted. The basic pattern is one that I’ve come to know well over the years, and which you could call a science version of the motte-and-bailey. (For those not up on nerd blogosphere terminology: in medieval times, the motte was a dank castle to which you’d retreat while under attack; the bailey was the desirable land that you’d farm once the attackers left.)
To wit:
- Startup makes claims that have both a true boring interpretation (e.g., you can do X with a quantum computer), as well as a false exciting interpretation (e.g., you can do X with a quantum computer, and it would actually make sense to do this, because you’ll get an asymptotic speedup over the best known classical algorithm).
- Lots of business and government people get all excited, because they assume the false exciting interpretation must be true (or why else would everyone be talking about this?). Some of those people ask me for comment.
- I look into it, perhaps by asking the folks at the startup. The startup folks clarify that they meant only the true boring interpretation. To be sure, they’re actively exploring the false exciting interpretation—whether some parts of it might be true after all—but they’re certainly not making any claims about it that would merit, say, a harsh post on Shtetl-Optimized.
- I’m satisfied to have gotten to the bottom of things, and I tell the startup folks to go their merry way.
- Yet many people continue to seem as excited as if the false exciting interpretation had been shown to be true. They continue asking me questions that presuppose its truth.
Our first instance of this pattern is the recent claim, by Zapata Computing, to have set a world record for integer factoring (1,099,551,473,989 = 1,048,589 × 1,048,601) with a quantum computer, by running a QAOA/variational algorithm on IBM’s superconducting device. Gosh! That sure sounds a lot better than the 21 that’s been factored with Shor’s algorithm, doesn’t it?
I read the Zapata paper that this is based on, entitled “Variational Quantum Factoring,” and I don’t believe that a single word in it is false. My issue is something the paper omits: namely, that once you’ve reduced factoring to a generic optimization problem, you’ve thrown away all the mathematical structure that Shor’s algorithm cleverly exploits, and that makes factoring asymptotically easy for a quantum computer. And hence there’s no reason to expect your quantum algorithm to scale any better than brute-force trial division (or in the most optimistic scenario, trial division enhanced with Grover search). On large numbers, your algorithm will be roundly outperformed even by classical algorithms that do exploit structure, like the Number Field Sieve. Indeed, the quantum computer’s success at factoring the number will have had little or nothing to do with its being quantum at all—a classical optimization algorithm would’ve served as well. And thus, the only reasons to factor a number on a quantum device in this way, would seem to be stuff like calibrating the device.
Admittedly, to people who work in quantum algorithms, everything above is so obvious that it doesn’t need to be said. But I learned at Q2B that there are interested people for whom this is not obvious, and even comes as a revelation. So that’s why I’m saying it.
Again and again over the past twenty years, I’ve seen people reinvent the notion of a “simpler alternative” to Shor’s algorithm: one that cuts out all the difficulty of building a fault-tolerant quantum computer. In every case, the trouble, typically left unstated, has been that these alternatives also cut out the exponential speedup that’s Shor’s algorithm’s raison d’être.
Our second example today of a quantum computing motte-and-bailey is the claim, by Toronto-based quantum computing startup Xanadu, that Gaussian BosonSampling can be used to solve all sorts of graph problems, like graph isomorphism, graph similarity, and densest subgraph. As the co-inventor of BosonSampling, few things would warm my heart more than finding an actual application for that model (besides quantum supremacy experiments and, perhaps, certified random number generation). But I still regard this as an open problem—if by “application,” we mean outperforming what you could’ve done classically.
In papers (see for example here, here, here), members of the Xanadu team have given all sorts of ways to take a graph, and encode it into an instance of Gaussian BosonSampling, in such a way that the output distribution will then reveal features of the graph, like its isomorphism type or its dense subgraphs. The trouble is that so far, I’ve seen no indications that this will actually lead to quantum algorithms that outperform the best classical algorithms, for any graph problems of practical interest.
In the case of Densest Subgraph, the Xanadu folks use the output of a Gaussian BosonSampler to seed (that is, provide an initial guess for) a classical local search algorithm. They say they observe better results this way than if they seed that classical local search algorithm with completely random initial conditions. But of course, the real question is: could we get equally good results by seeding with the output of some classical heuristic? Or by solving Densest Subgraph with a different approach entirely? Given how hard it’s turned out to be just to verify that the outputs of a BosonSampling device come from such a device at all, it would seem astonishing if the answer to these questions wasn’t “yes.”
In the case of Graph Isomorphism, the situation is even clearer. There, the central claim made by the Xanadu folks is that given a graph G, they can use a Gaussian BosonSampling device to sample a probability distribution that encodes G’s isomorphism type. So, isn’t this “promising” for solving GI with a quantum computer? All you’d need to do now is invent some fast classical algorithm that could look at the samples coming from two graphs G and H, and tell you whether the probability distributions were the same.
Except, not really. While the Xanadu paper never says so, if all you want is to sample a distribution that encodes a graph’s isomorphism type, that’s easy to do classically! (I even put this on the final exam for my undergraduate Quantum Information Science course a couple weeks ago.) Here’s how: given as input a graph G, just output G but with its vertices randomly permuted. Indeed, this will even provide a further property, better than anything the BosonSampling approach has been shown to provide (or than it probably does provide): namely, if G and H are not isomorphic, then the two probability distributions will not only be different but will have disjoint supports. Alas, this still leaves us with the problem of distinguishing which distribution a given sample came from, which is as hard as Graph Isomorphism itself. None of these approaches, classical or quantum, seem to lead to any algorithm that’s subexponential time, let alone competitive with the “Babai approach” of thinking really hard about graphs.
All of this stuff falls victim to what I regard as the Fundamental Error of Quantum Algorithms Research: namely, to treat it as “promising” that a quantum algorithm works at all, or works better than some brute-force classical algorithm, without asking yourself whether there are any indications that your approach will ever be able to exploit interference of amplitudes to outperform the best classical algorithm.
Incidentally, I’m not sure exactly why, but in practice, a major red flag that the Fundamental Error is about to be committed is when someone starts talking about “hybrid quantum/classical algorithms.” By this they seem to mean: “outside the domain of traditional quantum algorithms, so don’t judge us by the standards of that domain.” But I liked the way someone at Q2B put it to me: every quantum algorithm is a “hybrid quantum/classical algorithm,” with classical processors used wherever they can be, and qubits used only where they must be.
The other thing people do, when challenged, is to say “well, admittedly we have no rigorous proof of an asymptotic quantum speedup”—thereby brilliantly reframing the whole conversation, to make people like me look like churlish theoreticians insisting on an impossible and perhaps irrelevant standard of rigor, blind to some huge practical quantum speedup that’s about to change the world. The real issue, of course, is not that they haven’t given a proof of a quantum speedup (in either the real world or the black-box world); rather, it’s that they’ve typically given no reasons whatsoever to think that there might be a quantum speedup, compared to the best classical algorithms available.
In the holiday spirit, let me end on a positive note. When I did the Q&A at Q2B—the same one where Sarah Kaiser asked me to comment on the term “quantum supremacy”—one of my answers touched on the most important theoretical open problems about sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments. At the top of the list, I said, was whether there’s some interactive protocol by which a near-term quantum computer can not only exhibit quantum supremacy, but prove it to a polynomial-time-bounded classical skeptic. I mentioned that there was one proposal for how to do this, in the IQP model, due to Bremner and Shepherd, from way back in 2008. I said that their proposal deserved much more attention than it had received, and that trying to break it would be one obvious thing to work on. Little did I know that, literally while I was speaking, a paper was being posted to the arXiv, by Gregory Kahanamoku-Meyer, that claims to break Bremner and Shepherd’s protocol. I haven’t yet studied the paper, but assuming it’s correct, it represents the first clear progress on this problem in years (even though of a negative kind).

Along with my fellow new inductee Peter Shor, who I hear is a real up-and-comer in the quantum computing field. I will seek to use this awesome responsibility to steer the ACM along the path of good rather than evil.
Also, last week, I attended the Q2B conference in San Jose, where a central theme was the outlook for practical quantum computing in the wake of the first clear demonstration of quantum computational supremacy. Thanks to the folks at QC Ware for organizing a fun conference (full disclosure: I’m QC Ware’s Chief Scientific Advisor). I’ll have more to say about the actual scientific things discussed at Q2B in future posts.
None of that is why you’re here, though. You’re here because of the battle over “quantum supremacy.”
A week ago, my good friend and collaborator Zach Weinersmith, of SMBC Comics, put out a cartoon with a dark-curly-haired scientist named “Dr. Aaronson,” who’s revealed on a hot mic to be an evil “quantum supremacist.” Apparently a rush job, this cartoon is far from Zach’s finest work. For one thing, if the character is supposed to be me, why not draw him as me, and if he isn’t, why call him “Dr. Aaronson”? In any case, I learned from talking to Zach that the cartoon’s timing was purely coincidental: Zach didn’t even realize what a hornet’s-nest he was poking with this.
Ever since John Preskill coined it in 2012, “quantum supremacy” has been an awkward term. Much as I admire John Preskill’s wisdom, brilliance, generosity, and good sense, in physics as in everything else—yeah, “quantum supremacy” is not a term I would’ve coined, and it’s certainly not a hill I’d choose to die on. Once it had gained common currency, though, I sort of took a liking to it, mostly because I realized that I could mine it for dark one-liners in my talks.
The thinking was: even as white supremacy was making its horrific resurgence in the US and around the world, here we were, physicists and computer scientists and mathematicians of varied skin tones and accents and genders, coming together to pursue a different and better kind of supremacy—a small reflection of the better world that we still believed was possible. You might say that we were reclaiming the word “supremacy”—which, after all, just means a state of being supreme—for something non-sexist and non-racist and inclusive and good.
In the world of 2019, alas, perhaps it was inevitable that people wouldn’t leave things there.
My first intimation came a month ago, when Leonie Mueck—someone who I’d gotten to know and like when she was an editor at Nature handling quantum information papers—emailed me about her view that our community should abandon the term “quantum supremacy,” because of its potential to make women and minorities uncomfortable in our field. She advocated using “quantum advantage” instead.
So I sent Leonie back a friendly reply, explaining that, as the father of a math-loving 6-year-old girl, I understood and shared her concerns—but also, that I didn’t know an alternative term that really worked.
See, it’s like this. Preskill meant “quantum supremacy” to refer to a momentous event that seemed likely to arrive in a matter of years: namely, the moment when programmable quantum computers would first outpace the ability of the fastest classical supercomputers on earth, running the fastest algorithms known by humans, to simulate what the quantum computers were doing (at least on special, contrived problems). And … “the historic milestone of quantum advantage”? It just doesn’t sound right. Plus, as many others pointed out, the term “quantum advantage” is already used to refer to … well, quantum advantages, which might fall well short of supremacy.
But one could go further. Suppose we did switch to “quantum advantage.” Couldn’t that term, too, remind vulnerable people about the unfair advantages that some groups have over others? Indeed, while “advantage” is certainly subtler than “supremacy,” couldn’t that make it all the more insidious, and therefore dangerous?
Oblivious though I sometimes am, I realized Leonie would be unhappy if I offered that, because of my wholehearted agreement, I would henceforth never again call it “quantum supremacy,” but only “quantum superiority,” “quantum dominance,” or “quantum hegemony.”
But maybe you now see the problem. What word does the English language provide to describe one thing decisively beating or being better than a different thing for some purpose, and which doesn’t have unsavory connotations?
I’ve heard “quantum ascendancy,” but that makes it sound like we’re a UFO cult—waiting to ascend, like ytterbium ions caught in a laser beam, to a vast quantum computer in the sky.
I’ve heard “quantum inimitability” (that is, inability to imitate using a classical computer), but who can pronounce that?
Yesterday, my brilliant former student Ewin Tang (yes, that one) relayed to me a suggestion by Kevin Tian: “quantum eclipse” (that is, the moment when quantum computers first eclipse classical ones for some task). But would one want to speak of a “quantum eclipse experiment”? And shouldn’t we expect that, the cuter and cleverer the term, the harder it will be to use unironically?
In summary, while someone might think of a term so inspired that it immediately supplants “quantum supremacy” (and while I welcome suggestions), I currently regard it as an open problem.
Anyway, evidently dissatisfied with my response, last week Leonie teamed up with 13 others to publish a letter in Nature, which was originally entitled “Supremacy is for racists—use ‘quantum advantage,'” but whose title I see has now been changed to the less inflammatory “Instead of ‘supremacy’ use ‘quantum advantage.'” Leonie’s co-signatories included four of my good friends and colleagues: Alan Aspuru-Guzik, Helmut Katzgraber, Anne Broadbent, and Chris Granade (the last of whom got started in the field by helping me edit Quantum Computing Since Democritus).
(Update: Leonie pointed me to a longer list of signatories here, at their website called “quantumresponsibility.org.” A few names that might be known to Shtetl-Optimized readers are Andrew White, David Yonge-Mallo, Debbie Leung, Matt Leifer, Matthias Troyer.)
Their letter says:
The community claims that quantum supremacy is a technical term with a specified meaning. However, any technical justification for this descriptor could get swamped as it enters the public arena after the intense media coverage of the past few months.
In our view, ‘supremacy’ has overtones of violence, neocolonialism and racism through its association with ‘white supremacy’. Inherently violent language has crept into other branches of science as well — in human and robotic spaceflight, for example, terms such as ‘conquest’, ‘colonization’ and ‘settlement’ evoke the terra nullius arguments of settler colonialism and must be contextualized against ongoing issues of neocolonialism.
Instead, quantum computing should be an open arena and an inspiration for a new generation of scientists.
When I did an “Ask Me Anything” session, as the closing event at Q2B, Sarah Kaiser asked me to comment on the Nature petition. So I repeated what I’d said in my emailed response to Leonie—running through the problems with each proposed alternative term, talking about the value of reclaiming the word “supremacy,” and mostly just trying to diffuse the tension by getting everyone laughing together. Sarah later tweeted that she was “really disappointed” in my response.
Then the Wall Street Journal got in on the action, with a brief editorial (warning: paywalled) mocking the Nature petition:
There it is, folks: Mankind has hit quantum wokeness. Our species, akin to Schrödinger’s cat, is simultaneously brilliant and brain-dead. We built a quantum computer and then argued about whether the write-up was linguistically racist.
Taken seriously, the renaming game will never end. First put a Sharpie to the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says federal laws trump state laws. Cancel Matt Damon for his 2004 role in “The Bourne Supremacy.” Make the Air Force give up the term “air supremacy.” Tell lovers of supreme pizza to quit being so chauvinistic about their toppings. Please inform Motown legend Diana Ross that the Supremes are problematic.
The quirks of quantum mechanics, some people argue, are explained by the existence of many universes. How did we get stuck in this one?
Steven Pinker also weighed in, with a linguistically-informed tweetstorm:
This sounds like something from The Onion but actually appeared in Nature … It follows the wokified stigmatization of other innocent words, like “House Master” (now, at Harvard, Residential Dean) and “NIPS” (Neural Information Processing Society, now NeurIPS). It’s a familiar linguistic phenomenon, a lexical version of Gresham’s Law: bad meanings drive good ones out of circulation. Examples: the doomed “niggardly” (no relation to the n-word) and the original senses of “cock,” “ass,” “prick,” “pussy,” and “booty.” Still, the prissy banning of words by academics should be resisted. It dumbs down understanding of language: word meanings are conventions, not spells with magical powers, and all words have multiple senses, which are distinguished in context. Also, it makes academia a laughingstock, tars the innocent, and does nothing to combat actual racism & sexism.
Others had a stronger reaction. Curtis Yarvin, better known as Mencius Moldbug, is one of the founders of “neoreaction” (and a significant influence on Steve Bannon, Michael Anton, and other Trumpists). Regulars might remember that Yarvin argued with me in Shtetl-Optimized‘s comment section, under a post in which I denounced Trump’s travel ban and its effects on my Iranian PhD student. Since then, Yarvin has sent me many emails, which have ranged from long to extremely long, and whose message could be summarized as: “[labored breathing] Abandon your liberal Enlightenment pretensions, young Nerdwalker. Come over the Dark Side.”
After the “supremacy is for racists” letter came out in Nature, though, Yarvin sent me his shortest email ever. It was simply a link to the letter, along with the comment “I knew it would come to this.”
He meant: “What more proof do you need, young Nerdawan, that this performative wokeness is a cancer that will eventually infect everything you value—even totally apolitical research in quantum information? And by extension, that my whole worldview, which warned of this, is fundamentally correct, while your faith in liberal academia is naïve, and will be repaid only with backstabbing?”
In a subsequent email, Yarvin predicted that in two years, the whole community will be saying “quantum advantage” instead of “quantum supremacy,” and in five years I’ll be saying “quantum advantage” too. As Yarvin famously wrote: “Cthulhu may swim slowly. But he only swims left.”
So what do I really think about this epic battle for (and against) supremacy?
Truthfully, half of me just wants to switch to “quantum advantage” right now and be done with it. As I said, I know some of the signatories of the Nature letter to be smart and reasonable and kind. They don’t wish to rid the planet of everyone like me. They’re not Amanda Marcottes or Arthur Chus. Furthermore, there’s little I despise more than a meaty scientific debate devolving into a pointless semantic one, with brilliant friend after brilliant friend getting sucked into the vortex (“you too?”). I’m strongly in the Pinkerian camp, which holds that words are just arbitrary designators, devoid of the totemic power to dictate thoughts. So if friends and colleagues—even just a few of them—tell me that they find some word I use to be offensive, why not just be a mensch, apologize for any unintended hurt, switch words midsentence, and continue discussing the matter at hand?
But then the other half of me wonders: once we’ve ceded an open-ended veto over technical terms that remind anyone of anything bad, where does it stop? How do we ever certify a word as kosher? At what point do we all get to stop arguing and laugh together?
To make this worry concrete, look back at Sarah Kaiser’s Twitter thread—the one where she expresses disappointment in me. Below her tweet, someone remarks that, besides “quantum supremacy,” the word “ancilla” (as in ancilla qubit, a qubit used for intermediate computation or other auxiliary purposes) is problematic as well. Here’s Sarah’s response:
I agree, but I wanted to start by focusing on the obvious one, Its harder for them to object to just one to start with, then once they admit the logic, we can expand the list
(What would Curtis Yarvin say about that?)
You’re probably now wondering: what’s wrong with “ancilla”? Apparently, in ancient Rome, an “ancilla” was a female slave, and indeed that’s the Latin root of the English adjective “ancillary” (as in “providing support to”). I confess that I hadn’t known that—had you? Admittedly, once you do know, you might never again look at a Controlled-NOT gate—pitilessly flipping an ancilla qubit, subject only to the whims of a nearby control qubit—in quite the same way.
(Ah, but the ancilla can fight back against her controller! And she does—in the Hadamard basis.)
The thing is, if we’re gonna play this game: what about annihilation operators? Won’t those need to be … annihilated from physics?
And what about unitary matrices? Doesn’t their very name negate the multiplicity of perspectives and cultures?
What about Dirac’s oddly-named bra/ket notation, with its limitless potential for puerile jokes, about the “bra” vectors displaying their contents horizontally and so forth? (Did you smile at that, you hateful pig?)
What about daggers? Don’t we need a less violent conjugate tranpose?
Not to beat a dead horse, but once you hunt for examples, you realize that the whole dictionary is shot through with domination and brutality—that you’d have to massacre the English language to take it out. There’s nothing special about math or physics in this respect.
The same half of me also thinks about my friends and colleagues who oppose claims of quantum supremacy, or even the quest for quantum supremacy, on various scientific grounds. I.e., either they don’t think that the Google team achieved what it said, or they think that the task wasn’t hard enough for classical computers, or they think that the entire goal is misguided or irrelevant or uninteresting.
Which is fine—these are precisely the arguments we should be having—except that I’ve personally seen some of my respected colleagues, while arguing for these positions, opportunistically tack on ideological objections to the term “quantum supremacy.” Just to goose up their case, I guess. And I confess that every time they did this, it made me want to keep saying “quantum supremacy” from now till the end of time—solely to deny these colleagues a cheap and unearned “victory,” one they apparently felt they couldn’t obtain on the merits alone. I realize that this is childish and irrational.
Most of all, though, the half of me that I’m talking about thinks about Curtis Yarvin and the Wall Street Journal editorial board, cackling with glee to see their worldview so dramatically confirmed—as theatrical wokeness, that self-parodying modern monstrosity, turns its gaze on (of all things) quantum computing research. More red meat to fire up the base—or at least that sliver of the base nerdy enough to care. And the left, as usual, walks right into the trap, sacrificing its credibility with the outside world to pursue a runaway virtue-signaling spiral.
The same half of me thinks: do we really want to fight racism and sexism? Then let’s work together to assemble a broad coalition that can defeat Trump. And Jair Bolsonaro, and Viktor Orbán, and all the other ghastly manifestations of humanity’s collective lizard-brain. Then, if we’re really fantasizing, we could liberalize the drug laws, and get contraception and loans and education to women in the Third World, and stop the systematic disenfranchisement of black voters, and open up the world’s richer, whiter, and higher-elevation countries to climate refugees, and protect the world’s remaining indigenous lands (those that didn’t burn to the ground this year).
In this context, the trouble with obsessing over terms like “quantum supremacy” is not merely that it diverts attention, while contributing nothing to fighting the world’s actual racism and sexism. The trouble is that the obsessions are actually harmful. For they make academics—along with progressive activists—look silly. They make people think that we must not have meant it when we talked about the existential urgency of climate change and the world’s other crises. They pump oxygen into right-wing echo chambers.
But it’s worse than ridiculous, because of the message that I fear is received by many outside the activists’ bubble. When you say stuff like “[quantum] supremacy is for racists,” what’s heard might be something more like:
“Watch your back, you disgusting supremacist. Yes, you. You claim that you mentor women and minorities, donate to good causes, try hard to confront the demons in your own character? Ha! None of that counts for anything with us. You’ll never be with-it enough to be our ally, so don’t bother trying. We’ll see to it that you’re never safe, not even in the most abstruse and apolitical fields. We’ll comb through your words—even words like ‘ancilla qubit’—looking for any that we can cast as offensive by our opaque and ever-shifting standards. And once we find some, we’ll have it within our power to end your career, and you’ll be reduced to groveling that we don’t. Remember those popular kids who bullied you in second grade, giving you nightmares of social ostracism that persist to this day? We plan to achieve what even those bullies couldn’t: to shame you with the full backing of the modern world’s moral code. See, we’re the good guys of this story. It’s goodness itself that’s branding you as racist scum.”
In short, I claim that the message—not the message intended, of course, by anyone other than a Chu or a Marcotte or a SneerClubber, but the message received—is basically a Trump campaign ad. I claim further that our civilization’s current self-inflicted catastrophe will end—i.e., the believers in science and reason and progress and rule of law will claw their way back to power—when, and only when, a generation of activists emerges that understands these dynamics as well as Barack Obama did.
Wouldn’t it be awesome if, five years from now, I could say to Curtis Yarvin: you were wrong? If I could say to him: my colleagues and I still use the term ‘quantum supremacy’ whenever we care to, and none of us have been cancelled or ostracized for it—so maybe you should revisit your paranoid theories about Cthulhu and the Cathedral and so forth? If I could say: quantum computing researchers now have bigger fish to fry than arguments over words—like moving beyond quantum supremacy to the first useful quantum simulations, as well as the race for scalability and fault-tolerance? And even: progressive activists now have bigger fish to fry too—like retaking actual power all over the world?
Anyway, as I said, that’s how half of me feels. The other half is ready to switch to “quantum advantage” or any other serviceable term and get back to doing science.",19375,"['4e5bc7b6b1c81133c241708f4fd122c7a36929560f52bddb148f6b63ed990b73',

Please join me in giving thanks for the beautiful post below, by friend-of-the-blog Greg Kuperberg, which tells a mathematical story that stretches from the 200s BC all the way to Google’s quantum supremacy result last month.
Archimedes’ other principle and quantum supremacy
by Greg Kuperberg
Note: UC Davis is hiring in CS theory! Scott offered me free ad space if I wrote a guest post, so here we are. The position is in all areas of CS theory, including QC theory although the search is not limited to that.
In this post, I wear the hat of a pure mathematician in a box provided by Archimedes. I thus set aside what everyone else thinks is important about Google’s 53-qubit quantum supremacy experiment, that it is a dramatic milestone in quantum computing technology. That’s only news about the physical world, whose significance pales in comparison to the Platonic world of mathematical objects. In my happy world, I like quantum supremacy as a demonstration of a beautiful coincidence in mathematics that has been known for more than 2000 years in a special case. The single-qubit case was discovered by Archimedes, duh. As Scott mentions in Quantum Computing Since Democritus, Bill Wootters stated the general result in a 1990 paper, but Wootters credits a 1974 paper by the Czech physicist Stanislav Sýkora. I learned of it in the substantially more general context of symplectic geometric that mathematicians developed independently between Sýkora’s prescient paper and Wootters’ more widely known citation. Much as I would like to clobber you with highly abstract mathematics, I will wait for some other time.
Suppose that you pick a pure state \(|\psi\rangle\) in the Hilbert space \(\mathbb{C}^d\) of a \(d\)-dimensional qudit, and then make many copies and fully measure each one, so that you sample many times from some distribution \(\mu\) on the \(d\) outcomes. You can think of such a distribution \(\mu\) as a classical randomized state on a digit of size \(d\). The set of all randomized states on a \(d\)-digit makes a \((d-1)\)-dimensional simplex \(\Delta^{d-1}\) in the orthant \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\). The coincidence is that if \(|\psi\rangle\) is uniformly random in the unit sphere in \(\mathbb{C}^d\), then \(\mu\) is uniformly random in \(\Delta^{d-1}\). I will call it the Born map, since it expresses the Born rule of quantum mechanics that amplitudes yield probabilities. Here is a diagram of the Born map of a qutrit, except with the laughable simplification of the 5-sphere in \(\mathbb{C}^3\) drawn as a 2-sphere.
If you pretend to be a bad probability student, then you might not be surprised by this coincidence, because you might suppose that all probability distributions are uniform other than treacherous exceptions to your intuition. However, the principle is certainly not true for a “rebit” (a qubit with real amplitudes) or for higher-dimensional “redits.” With real amplitudes, the probability density goes to infinity at the sides of the simplex \(\Delta^{d-1}\) and is even more favored at the corners. It also doesn’t work for mixed qudit states; the projection then favors the middle of \(\Delta^{d-1}\).
Archimedes’ theorem
The theorem of Archimedes is that a natural projection from the unit sphere to a circumscribing vertical cylinder preserves area. The projection is the second one that you might think of: Project radially from a vertical axis rather than radially in all three directions. Since Archimedes was a remarkably prescient mathematician, he was looking ahead to the Bloch sphere of pure qubit states \(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) written in density operator form. If you measure \(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) in the computational basis, you get a randomized bit state \(\mu\) somewhere on the interval from guaranteed 0 to guaranteed 1.
This transformation from a quantum state to a classical randomized state is a linear projection to a vertical axis. It is the same as Archimedes’ projection, except without the angle information. It doesn’t preserve dimension, but it does preserve measure (area or length, whatever) up to a factor of \(2\pi\). In particular, it takes a uniformly random \(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) to a uniformly random \(\mu\).
Archimedes’ projection is also known as the Lambert cylindrical map of the world. This is the map that squishes Greenland along with the top of North America and Eurasia to give them proportionate area.
(I forgive Lambert if he didn’t give prior credit to Archimedes. There was no Internet back then to easily find out who did what first.) Here is a calculus-based proof of Archimedes’ theorem: In spherical coordinates, imagine an annular strip on the sphere at a polar angle of \(\theta\). (The polar angle is the angle from vertical in spherical coordinates, as depicted in red in the Bloch sphere diagram.) The strip has a radius of \(\sin\theta\), which makes it shorter than its unit radius friend on the cylinder. But it’s also tilted from vertical by an angle of \(\frac{\pi}2-\theta\), which makes it wider by a factor of \(1/(\sin \theta)\) than the height of its projection onto the \(z\) axis. The two factors exactly cancel out, making the area of the strip exactly proportional to the length of its projection onto the \(z\) axis. This is a coincidence which is special to the 2-sphere in 3 dimensions. As a corollary, we get that the surface area of a unit sphere is \(4\pi\), the same as an open cylinder with radius 1 and height 2. If you want to step through this in even more detail, Scott mentioned to me an action video which is vastly spiffier than anything that I could ever make.
The projection of the Bloch sphere onto an interval also shows what goes wrong if you try this with a rebit. The pure rebit states — again expressed in density operator form \(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) are a great circle in the Bloch sphere. If you linearly project a circle onto an interval, then the length of the circle is clearly bunched up at the ends of the interval and the projected measure on the interval is not uniform.
Sýkora’s generalization
It is a neat coincidence that the Born map of a qubit preserves measure, but a proof that relies on Archimedes’ theorem seems to depend on the special geometry of the Bloch sphere of a qubit. That the higher-dimensional Born map also preserves measure is downright eerie. Scott challenged me to write an intuitive explanation. I remembered two different (but similar) proofs, neither of which is original to me. Scott and I disagree as to which proof is nicer.
As a first step of the first proof, it is easy to show that the Born map \(p = |z|^2\) for a single amplitude \(z\) preserves measure as a function from the complex plane \(\mathbb{C}\) to the ray \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}\). The region in the complex numbers \(\mathbb{C}\) where the length of \(z\) is between \(a\) and \(b\), or \(a \le |z| \le b\), is \(\pi(b^2 – a^2)\). The corresponding interval for the probability is \(a^2 \le p \le b^2\), which thus has length \(b^2-a^2\). That’s all, we’ve proved it! More precisely, the area of any circularly symmetric region in \(\mathbb{C}\) is \(\pi\) times the length of its projection onto \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}\).
The second step is to show the same thing for the Born map from the \(d\)-qudit Hilbert space \(\mathbb{C}^d\) to the \(d\)-digit orthant \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\), again without unit normalization. It’s also measure-preserving, up to a factor of \(\pi^d\) this time, because it’s the same thing in each coordinate separately. To be precise, the volume ratio holds for any region in \(\mathbb{C}^d\) that is invariant under separately rotating each of the \(d\) phases. (Because you can approximate any such region with a union of products of thin annuli.)
The third and final step is the paint principle for comparing surface areas. If you paint the hoods of two cars with the same thin layer of paint and you used the same volume of paint for each one, then you can conclude that the two car hoods have nearly same area. In our case, the Born map takes the region \[ 1 \le |z_0|^2 + |z_1|^2 + \cdots + |z_{d-1}|^2 \le 1+\epsilon \] in \(\mathbb{C}^d\) to the region \[ 1 \le p_0 + p_1 + \cdots + p_{d-1} \le 1+\epsilon \] in the orthant \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\). The former is the unit sphere \(S^{2d-1}\) in \(\mathbb{C}^d\) painted to a thickness of roughly \(\epsilon/2\). The latter is the probability simplex \(\Delta^{n-1}\) painted to a thickness of exactly \(\epsilon\). Taking the limit \(\epsilon \to 0\), the Born map from \(S^{2d-1}\) to \(\Delta^{n-1}\) preserves measure up to a factor of \(2\pi^n\).
You might wonder “why” this argument works even if you accept that it does work. The key is that the exponent 2 appears in two different ways: as the dimension of the complex numbers, and as the exponent used to set probabilities and define spheres. If we try the same argument with real amplitudes, then the volume between “spheres” of radius \(a\) and \(b\) is just \(2(b-a)\), which does not match the length \(b^2-a^2\). The Born map for a single real amplitude is the parabola \(p = x^2\), which clearly distorts length since it is not linear. The higher-dimensional real Born map similarly distorts volumes, whether or not you restrict to unit-length states.
If you’re a bitter-ender who still wants Archimedes’ theorem for real amplitudes, then you might consider the variant formula \(p = |x|\) to obtain a probability \(p\) from a “quantum amplitude” \(x\). Then the “Born” map does preserve measure, but for the trivial reason that \(x = \pm p\) is not really a quantum amplitude, it is a probability with a vestigial sign. Also the unit “sphere” in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is not really a sphere in this theory, it is a hyperoctahedron. The only “unitary” operators that preserve the unit hyperoctahedron are signed permutation matrices. You can only use them for reversible classical computing or symbolic dynamics; they don’t have the strength of true quantum computing or quantum mechanics.
The fact that the Born map preserves measure also yields a bonus calculation of the volume of the unit ball in \(2d\) real dimensions, if we interpret that as \(d\) complex dimensions. The ball \[ |z_0|^2 + |z_1|^2 + \cdots + |z_{d-1}|^2 \le 1 \] in \(\mathbb{C}^d\) is sent to a different simplex \[ p_0 + p_1 + \cdots + p_{d-1} \le 1 \] in \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\). If we recall that the volume of a \(d\)-dimensional pyramid is \(\frac1d\) times base times height and calculate by induction on \(d\), we get that this simplex has volume \(\frac1{d!}\). Thus, the volume of the \(2d\)-dimensional unit ball is \(\frac{\pi^d}{d!}\).
You might ask whether the volume of a \(d\)-dimensional unit ball is always \(\frac{\pi^{d/2}}{(d/2)!}\) for both \(d\) even and odd. The answer is yes if we interpret factorials using the gamma function formula \(x! = \Gamma(x+1)\) and look up that \(\frac12! = \Gamma(\frac32) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}2\). The gamma function was discovered by Euler as a solution to the question of defining fractional factorials, but the notation \(\Gamma(x)\) and the cumbersome shift by 1 is due to Legendre. Although Wikipedia says that no one knows why Legendre defined it this way, I wonder if his goal was to do what the Catholic church later did for itself in 1978: It put a Pole at the origin.
(Scott wanted to censor this joke. In response, I express my loyalty to my nation of birth by quoting the opening of the Polish national anthem: “Poland has not yet died, so long as we still live!” I thought at first that Stanislav Sýkora is Polish since Stanisław and Sikora are both common Polish names, but his name has Czech spelling and he is Czech. Well, the Czechs are cool too.)
Sýkora’s 1974 proof of the generalized Archimedes’ theorem is different from this one. He calculates multivariate moments of the space of unit states \(S^{2d-1} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^d\), and confirms that they match the moments in the probability simplex \(\Delta^{d-1}\). There are inevitably various proofs of this result, and I will give another one.
Another proof, and quantum supremacy
There is a well-known and very useful algorithm to generate a random point on the unit sphere in either \(\mathbb{R}^d\) or \(\mathbb{C}^d\), and a similar algorithm to generate a random point in a simplex. In the former algorithm, we make each real coordinate \(x\) into an independent Gaussian random variable with density proportional to \(e^{-x^2}\;dx\), and then rescale the result to unit length. Since the exponents combine as \[ e^{-x_0^2}e^{-x_1^2}\cdots e^{-x_{d-1}^2} = e^{-(x_0^2 + x_1^2 + \cdots + x_{d-1}^2)}, \] we learn that the total exponent is spherically symmetric. Therefore after rescaling, the result is a uniformly random point on the unit sphere \(S^{d-1} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d\). Similarly, the other algorithm generates a point in the orthant \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\) by making each real coordinate \(p \ge 0\) an independent random variable with exponential distribution \(e^{-p}\;dp\). This time we rescale the vector until its sum is 1. This algorithm likewise produces a uniformly random point in the simplex \(\Delta^{d-1} \subseteq \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\) because the total exponent of the product \[ e^{-p_0}e^{-p_1}\cdots e^{-p_{d-1}} = e^{-(p_0 + p_1 + \cdots + p_{d-1})} \] only depends on the sum of the coordinates. Wootters describes both of these algorithms in his 1990 paper, but instead of relating them to give his own proof of the generalized Archimedes’ theorem, he cites Sýkora.
The gist of the proof is that the Born map takes the Gaussian algorithm to the exponential algorithm. Explicitly, the Gaussian probability density for a single complex amplitude \[ z = x+iy = re^{i\theta} \] can be converted from Cartesian to polar coordinate as follows: \[ \frac{e^{-|z|^2}\;dx\;dy}{\pi} = \frac{e^{-r^2}r\;dr\;d\theta}{\pi}. \] I have included the factor of \(r\) that is naturally present in an area integral in polar coordinates. We will need it, and it is another way to see that the theorem relies on the fact that the complex numbers are two-dimensional. To complete the proof, we substitute \(p = r^2\) and remember that \(dp = 2r\;dr\), and then integrate over \(\theta\) (trivially, since the integrand does not depend on \(\theta\)). The density simplifies to \(e^{-p}\;dp\), which is exactly the exponential distribution for a real variable \(p \ge 0\). Since the Born map takes the Gaussian algorithm to the exponential algorithm, and since each algorithm produces a uniformly random point, the Born map must preserve uniform measure. (Scott likes this proof better because it is algorithmic, and because it is probabilistic.)
Now about quantum supremacy. You might think that a random chosen quantum circuit on \(n\) qubits produces a nearly uniformly random quantum state \(|\psi\rangle\) in their joint Hilbert space, but it’s not quite not that simple. When \(n=53\), or otherwise as \(n \to \infty\), a manageable random circuit is not nearly creative enough to either reach or approximate most of the unit states in the colossal Hilbert space of dimension \(d = 2^n\). The state \(|\psi\rangle\) that you get from (say) a polynomial-sized circuit resembles a fully random state in various statistical and computational respects, both proven and conjectured. As a result, if you measure the qubits in the computational basis, you get a randomized state on \(n\) bits that resembles a uniformly random point in \(\Delta^{2^n-1}\).
If you choose \(d\) probabilities, and if each one is an independent exponential random variable, then the law of large numbers says that the sum (which you use for rescaling) is close to \(d\) when \(d\) is large. When \(d\) is really big like \(2^{53}\), a histogram of the probabilities of the bit strings of a supremacy experiment looks like an exponential curve \(f(p) \propto e^{-pd}\). In a sense, the statistical distribution of the bit strings is almost the same almost every time, independent of which random quantum circuit you choose to generate them. The catch is that the position of any given bit string does depend on the circuit and is highly scrambled. I picture it in my mind like this:
It is thought to be computationally intractable to calculate where each bit string lands on this exponential curve, or even where just one of them does. (The exponential curve is attenuated by noise in the actual experiment, but it’s the same principle.) That is one reason that random quantum circuits are supreme.",16564,"['2b9f1fc79a964f7cdbdf42d9e832bb5af390ca5365ee4f16710bcb230b2d7caa', '8b75dc646e7c279e9e7f0831e6fc595ec1b72b68570e5d5855d3d02ec319195f', 'c13f634d81b09b8d1d86187376b3f1f5aea9fc527b2e2631f650e0eaaebec318', '6e679042739532f0a461a893e2154a6f69d3ab156d32f0ea2946181d227b9cca', '8422b24a8d7d5942af7531ca3771d2430f1b52b1b8a2e3a5b7b23d0a49eafbfc', '5d4f1823c385cbebe32b02a7170b8591bb52502b292dd7791daa4f8aa177c870', 'f97a2b7c8689dc5dba673f54a766bdfd6af298dce2717bf164c1b2c04aed68bc', 'c4035d13d25e12ab40f358f6d810b462149675219eac11da50c14dc48a14aa9b', 'be10a556b1b3489170c769550be119503c3e205104ed4e26221c16bb1fe3330d', '44bc905d65df752b1ab8ebe7cf1ddc25f949233573f3b3a737f17de445f20c04', '583880f969b3ec4932407d7abf5b4c816e207b985220b1523f3bdfa155c637c3', '0debabbd36e9fa3e002d6507fdd0201e608a10f548ac1a9bd2007238445d2708', 'ca7fdbf3ff57132f5e8711612cfe277dc95813e75a01fee91bacc039c52b3f05']"
79,4414,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4414,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2019-11-17,Scott Aaronson,The Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture (2008-2019),"Update: Sadly, Nathan Keller and Ohad Klein tell me that they’ve retracted their preprint, because of what currently looks like a fatal flaw in Lemma 5.3, uncovered by Paata Ivanishvili. I wish them the best of luck in fixing the problem. In the meantime, I’m leaving up this post for “historical” reasons.
Around 1999, one of the first things I ever did in quantum computing theory was to work on a problem that Fortnow and Rogers suggested in a paper: is it possible to separate P from BQP relative to a random oracle? (That is, without first needing to separate P from PSPACE or whatever in the real world?) Or to the contrary: suppose that a quantum algorithm Q makes T queries to a Boolean input string X. Is there then a classical simulation algorithm that makes poly(T) queries to X, and that approximates Q’s acceptance probability for most values of X? Such a classical simulation, were it possible, would still be consistent with the existence of quantum algorithms like Simon’s and Shor’s, which are able to achieve exponential (and even greater) speedups in the black-box setting. It would simply demonstrate the importance, for Simon’s and Shor’s algorithms, of global structure that makes the string X extremely non-random: for example, encoding a periodic function (in the case of Shor’s algorithm), or encoding a function that hides a secret string s (in the case of Simon’s). It would underscore that superpolynomial quantum speedups depend on structure.
I never managed to solve this problem. Around 2008, though, I noticed that a solution would follow from a perhaps-not-obviously-related conjecture, about influences in low-degree polynomials. Namely, let p:Rn→R be a degree-d real polynomial in n variables, and suppose p(x)∈[0,1] for all x∈{0,1}n. Define the variance of p to be
Var(p):=Ex,y[|p(x)-p(y)|],
and define the influence of the ith variable to be
Infi(p):=Ex[|p(x)-p(xi)|].
Here the expectations are over strings in {0,1}n, and xi means x with its ith bit flipped between 0 and 1. Then the conjecture is this: there must be some variable i such that Infi(p) ≥ poly(Var(p)/d) (in other words, that “explains” a non-negligible fraction of the variance of the entire polynomial).
Why would this conjecture imply the statement about quantum algorithms? Basically, because of the seminal result of Beals et al. from 1998: that if a quantum algorithm makes T queries to a Boolean input X, then its acceptance probability can be written as a real polynomial over the bits of X, of degree at most 2T. Given that result, if you wanted to classically simulate a quantum algorithm Q on most inputs—and if you only cared about query complexity, not computation time—you’d simply need to do the following:
(1) Find the polynomial p that represents Q’s acceptance probability.
(2) Find a variable i that explains at least a 1/poly(T) fraction of the total remaining variance in p, and query that i.
(3) Keep repeating step (2), until p has been restricted to a polynomial with not much variance left—i.e., to nearly a constant function p(X)=c. Whenever that happens, halt and output the constant c.
The key is that by hypothesis, this algorithm will halt, with high probability over X, after only poly(T) steps.
Anyway, around the same time, Andris Ambainis had a major break on a different problem that I’d told him about: namely, whether randomized and quantum query complexities are polynomially related for all partial functions with permutation symmetry (like the collision and the element distinctness functions). Andris and I decided to write up the two directions jointly. The result was our 2011 paper entitled The Need for Structure in Quantum Speedups.
Of the two contributions in the “Need for Structure” paper, the one about random oracles and influences in low-degree polynomials was clearly the weaker and less satisfying one. As the reviewers pointed out, that part of the paper didn’t solve anything: it just reduced one unsolved problem to a new, slightly different problem that was also unsolved. Nevertheless, that part of the paper acquired a life of its own over the ensuing decade, as the world’s experts in analysis of Boolean functions and polynomials began referring to the “Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture.” Ryan O’Donnell, Guy Kindler, and many others had a stab. I even got Terry Tao to spend an hour or two on the problem when I visited UCLA.
Now, at long last, Nathan Keller and Ohad Klein say they’ve proven the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture, in a preprint whose title is a riff on ours: “Quantum Speedups Need Structure.”
Their paper hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed, and I haven’t yet carefully studied it, but I could and should: at 19 pages, it looks very approachable and clear, if not as radically short as (say) Huang’s proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture. Keller and Klein’s argument subsumes all the earlier results that I knew would need to be subsumed, and involves all the concepts (like a real analogue of block sensitivity) that I knew would need to be involved somehow.
My plan had been as follows:
(1) Read their paper in detail. Understand every step of their proof.
(2) Write a blog post that reflects my detailed understanding.
Unfortunately, this plan did not sufficiently grapple with the fact that I now have two kids. It got snagged for a week at step (1). So I’m now executing an alternative plan, which is to jump immediately to the blog post.
Assuming Keller and Klein’s result holds up—as I expect it will—by combining it with the observations in my and Andris’s paper, one immediately gets an explanation for why no one has managed to separate P from BQP relative to a random oracle, but only relative to non-random oracles. This complements the work of Kahn, Saks, and Smyth, who around 2000 gave a precisely analogous explanation for the difficulty of separating P from NP∩coNP relative to a random oracle.
Unfortunately, the polynomial blowup is quite enormous: from a quantum algorithm making T queries, Keller and Klein apparently get a classical algorithm making O(T18) queries. But such things can almost always be massively improved.
Feel free to use the comments to ask any questions about this result or its broader context. I’ll either do my best to answer from the limited amount I know, or else I’ll pass the questions along to Nathan and Ohad themselves. Maybe, at some point, I’ll even be forced to understand the new proof.
Congratulations to Nathan and Ohad!
Update (Nov. 20): Tonight I finally did what I should’ve done two weeks ago, and worked through the paper from start to finish. Modulo some facts about noise operators, hypercontractivity, etc. that I took on faith, I now have a reasonable (albeit imperfect) understanding of the proof. It’s great!
In case it’s helpful to anybody, here’s my one-paragraph summary of how it works. First, you hit your bounded degree-d function f with a random restriction to attenuate its higher-degree Fourier coefficients (reminiscent of Linial-Mansour-Nisan). Next, in that attenuated function, you find a small “coalition” of influential variables—by which we mean, a set of variables for which there’s some assignment that substantially biases f. You keep iterating—finding influential coalitions in subfunctions on n/4, n/8, etc. variables. All the while, you keep track of the norm of the vector of all the block-sensitivities of all the inputs (the authors don’t clearly explain this in the intro, but they reveal it near the end). Every time you find another influential coalition, that norm goes down by a little, but by approximation theory, it can only go down O(d2) times until it hits rock bottom and your function is nearly constant. By the end, you’ll have approximated f itself by a decision tree of depth poly(d, 1/ε, log(n)). Finally, you get rid of the log(n) term by using the fact that f essentially depended on at most exp(O(d)) variables anyway.
Anyway, I’m not sure how helpful it is to write more: the paper itself is about 95% as clear as it could possibly be, and even where it isn’t, you’d probably need to read it first (and, uh, know something about influences, block sensitivity, random restrictions, etc.) before any further clarifying remarks would be of use. But happy to discuss more in the comments, if anyone else is reading it.",8296,"['e7fbd836cbb55d66342c9a7e6b22bd23e0982e29e0a706a6485ea6fa8d073036', '6a560bbfc9dc0ef72ea82b675bc5bd066054dcd3d910cfbdc3a9d9623508e5aa', 'd55a50d05c0b3aef2de3648182588afb100d91689260491b5133b9724aaccefb', '8f86a0e0afe4975a9ea376237c84530df8f546963683ace09721e7dcb60e6784', '44718187d6902fa6c4a6ec7b91a9b362caac92945e877b17cce66ebb838f2a00', 'ca7162f922870acf1e74d1842021e9f85b248c53ffc56823c772dfe8338a63c8', 'b36342d1fbafaae9c3c27b347e6c911f9ba7aee664b2d45820458bc252f537cb', '56b00e7f4a2912695d241829ac8720dbcf7f15700abbe91f01857a3765658c4e', '8465aae2bc243bd29c635a6c91f490f548c236a8bff8b627c138de741824d456']"

This fall Shyam Shankar joined our Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) faculty to do experimental superconducting qubits, while (as I blogged in the summer) the quantum complexity theorist John Wright will join me on the CS faculty in Fall 2020. Meanwhile, Drew Potter, an expert on topological qubits, rejoined our physics faculty after a brief leave. Our weekly quantum information group meeting now regularly attracts around 30 participants—from the turnout, you wouldn’t know it’s not MIT or Caltech or Waterloo. My own group now has five postdocs and six PhD students—as well as some amazing undergrads striving to meet the bar set by Ewin Tang. Course offerings in quantum information currently include Brian La Cour’s Freshman Research Initiative, my own undergrad Intro to Quantum Information Science honors class, and graduate classes on quantum complexity theory, experimental realizations of QC, and topological matter (with more to come). We’ll also be starting an undergraduate Quantum Information Science concentration next fall.
So without further ado:
(1) If you’re interested in pursuing a PhD focused on quantum computing and information (and/or classical theoretical computer science) at UT Austin: please apply! If you want to work with me or John Wright on quantum algorithms and complexity, apply to CS (I can also supervise physics students in rare cases). Also apply to CS, of course, if you want to work with our other CS theory faculty: David Zuckerman, Dana Moshkovitz, Adam Klivans, Anna Gal, Eric Price, Brent Waters, Vijaya Ramachandran, or Greg Plaxton. If you want to work with Drew Potter on nonabelian anyons or suchlike, or with Allan MacDonald, Linda Reichl, Elaine Li, or others on many-body quantum theory, apply to physics. If you want to work with Shyam Shankar on superconducting qubits, apply to ECE. Note that the deadline for CS and physics is December 1, while the deadline for ECE is December 15.
You don’t need to ask me whether I’m on the lookout for great students: I always am! If you say on your application that you want to work with me, I’ll be sure to see it. Emailing individual faculty members is not how it works and won’t help. Admissions are extremely competitive, so I strongly encourage you to apply broadly to maximize your options.
(2) If you’re interested in a postdoc in my group, I’ll have approximately two openings starting in Fall 2020. To apply, just send me an email by January 1, 2020 with the following info:
– Your CV
– 2 or 3 of your best papers (links or PDF attachments)
– The names of two recommenders (who should email me their letters separately)
(3) If you’re on the faculty job market in quantum computing and information—well, please give me a heads-up if you’re potentially interested in Austin! Our CS, physics, and ECE departments are all open to considering additional candidates in quantum information, both junior and senior. I can’t take credit for this—it surely has to do with developments beyond my control, both at UT and beyond—but I’m happy to relay that, in the three years since I arrived in Texas, the appetite for strengthening UT’s presence in quantum information has undergone jaw-dropping growth at every level of the university.
Also, Austin-Bergstrom International Airport now has direct flights to London, Frankfurt, and (soon) Amsterdam and Paris.

Is this pursuit [of scalable quantum computation] just an arms race? A race to see who can achieve it first? To what end? Will this achievement yield advances in medical science and human quality of life, or will it threaten us even more than we are threatened presently by our technologies? You seem rather sanguine about its possible development and uses. But how close does the hand on that doomsday clock move to midnight once we “can harness an exponential number of amplitudes for computation”?
I thought this question might possibly be of some broader interest, so here’s my response (with some light edits).
Dear Richard,
A radio interviewer asked me a similar question a couple weeks ago—whether there’s an ethical dimension to quantum computing research. I replied that there’s an ethical dimension to everything that humans do.
A quantum computer is not like a nuclear weapon: it’s not going to directly kill anybody (unless the dilution refrigerator falls on them or something?). It’s true that a full, scalable QC, if and when it’s achieved, will give a temporary advantage to people who want to break certain cryptographic codes. The morality of that, of course, could strongly depend on whether the codebreakers are working for the “good guys” (like the Allies during WWII) or the “bad guys” (like, perhaps, Trump or Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping).
But in any case, there’s already a push to switch to new cryptographic codes that already exist and that we think are quantum-resistant. An actual scalable QC on the horizon would of course massively accelerate that push. And once people make the switch, we expect that security on the Internet will be more-or-less back where it started.
Meanwhile, the big upside potential from QCs is that they’ll provide an unprecedented ability to simulate physics and chemistry at the molecular level. That could at least potentially help with designing new medicines, as well as new batteries and solar cells and carbon capture technologies—all things that the world desperately needs right now.
Also, the theory developed around QC has already led to many new and profound insights about physics and computation. Some of us regard that as an inherent good, in the same way that art and music and literature are.
Now, one could argue that the climate crisis, or various other crises that our civilization faces, are so desperate that instead of working to build QCs, we should all just abandon our normal work and directly confront the crises, as (for example) Greta Thunberg is doing. On some days I share that position. But of course, were the position upheld, it would have implications not just for quantum computing researchers but for almost everyone on earth—including humanities teachers like yourself.

NEW: My preprint with Sam Gunn, On the Classical Hardness of Spoofing Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmarking
My interview on NPR affiliate WOSU (starts around 16:30)
When Google’s quantum supremacy paper leaked a month ago—not through Google’s error, but through NASA’s—I had a hard time figuring out how to cover the news here. I had to say something; on the other hand, I wanted to avoid any detailed technical analysis of the leaked paper, because I was acutely aware that my colleagues at Google were still barred by Nature‘s embargo rules from publicly responding to anything I or others said. (I was also one of the reviewers for the Nature paper, which put additional obligations on me.)
I ended up with Scott’s Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ, which tried to toe this impossible line by “answering general questions about quantum supremacy, and the consequences of its still-hypothetical achievement, in light of the leak.” It wasn’t an ideal solution—for one thing, because while I still regard Google’s sampling experiment as a historic milestone for our whole field, there are some technical issues, aspects that subsequent experiments (hopefully coming soon) will need to improve. Alas, the ground rules of my FAQ forced me to avoid such issues, which caused some readers to conclude mistakenly that I didn’t think there were any.
Now, though, the Google paper has come out as Nature‘s cover story, at the same time as there have been new technical developments—most obviously, the paper from IBM (see also their blog post) saying that they could simulate the Google experiment in 2.5 days, rather than the 10,000 years that Google had estimated.
(Yesterday I was deluged by emails asking me “whether I’d seen” IBM’s paper. As a science blogger, I try to respond to stuff pretty quickly when necessary, but I don’t—can’t—respond in Twitter time.)
So now the gloves are off. No more embargo. Time to address the technical stuff under the hood—which is the purpose of this post.
I’m going to assume, from this point on, that you already understand the basics of sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments, and that I don’t need to correct beginner-level misconceptions about what the term “quantum supremacy” does and doesn’t mean (no, it doesn’t mean scalability, fault-tolerance, useful applications, breaking public-key crypto, etc. etc.). If this is not the case, you could start (e.g.) with my FAQ, or with John Preskill’s excellent Quanta commentary.
Without further ado:
(1) So what about that IBM thing? Are random quantum circuits easy to simulate classically?
OK, so let’s carefully spell out what the IBM paper says. They argue that, by commandeering the full attention of Summit at Oak Ridge National Lab, the most powerful supercomputer that currently exists on Earth—one that fills the area of two basketball courts, and that (crucially) has 250 petabytes of hard disk space—one could just barely store the entire quantum state vector of Google’s 53-qubit Sycamore chip in hard disk. And once one had done that, one could simulate the chip in ~2.5 days, more-or-less just by updating the entire state vector by brute force, rather than the 10,000 years that Google had estimated on the basis of my and Lijie Chen’s “Schrödinger-Feynman algorithm” (which can get by with less memory).
The IBM group understandably hasn’t actually done this yet—even though IBM set it up, the world’s #1 supercomputer isn’t just sitting around waiting for jobs! But I see little reason to doubt that their analysis is basically right. I don’t know why the Google team didn’t consider how such near-astronomical hard disk space would change their calculations; probably they wish they had.
I find this to be much, much better than IBM’s initial reaction to the Google leak, which was simply to dismiss the importance of quantum supremacy as a milestone. Designing better classical simulations is precisely how IBM and others should respond to Google’s announcement, and how I said a month ago that I hoped they would respond. If we set aside the pass-the-popcorn PR war (or even if we don’t), this is how science progresses.
But does IBM’s analysis mean that “quantum supremacy” hasn’t been achieved? No, it doesn’t—at least, not under any definition of “quantum supremacy” that I’ve ever used. The Sycamore chip took about 3 minutes to generate the ~5 million samples that were needed to pass the “linear cross-entropy benchmark”—the statistical test that Google applies to the outputs of its device.
(Technical note added: Google’s samples are extremely noisy—the actual distribution being sampled from is something like 0.998U+0.002D, where U is the uniform distribution and D is the hard distribution that you want. What this means, in practice, is that you need to take a number of samples that’s large compared to 1/0.0022, in order to extract a signal corresponding to D. But the good news is that Google can take that many samples in just a few minutes, since once the circuit has been loaded onto the chip, generating each sample takes only about 40 microseconds. And once you’ve done this, what hardness results we have for passing the linear cross-entropy test—to be discussed later in this post—apply basically just as well as if you’d taken a single noiseless sample.)
Anyway, you might notice that three minutes versus 2.5 days is still a quantum speedup by a factor of 1200. But even more relevant, I think, is to compare the number of “elementary operations.” Let’s generously count a FLOP (floating-point operation) as the equivalent of a quantum gate. Then by my estimate, we’re comparing ~5×109 quantum gates against ~2×1020 FLOPs—a quantum speedup by a factor of ~40 billion.
For me, though, the broader point is that neither party here—certainly not IBM—denies that the top-supercomputers-on-the-planet-level difficulty of classically simulating Google’s 53-qubit programmable chip really is coming from the exponential character of the quantum states in that chip, and nothing else. That’s what makes this back-and-forth fundamentally different from the previous one between D-Wave and the people who sought to simulate its devices classically. The skeptics, like me, didn’t much care what speedup over classical benchmarks there was or wasn’t today: we cared about the increase in the speedup as D-Wave upgraded its hardware, and the trouble was that we never saw a convincing case that there would be one. I’m a theoretical computer scientist, and this is what I believe: that after the constant factors have come and gone, what remains are asymptotic growth rates.
In the present case, while increasing the circuit depth won’t evade IBM’s “store everything to hard disk” strategy, increasing the number of qubits will. If Google, or someone else, upgraded from 53 to 55 qubits, that would apparently already be enough to exceed Summit’s 250-petabyte storage capacity. At 60 qubits, you’d need 33 Summits. At 70 qubits, enough Summits to fill a city … you get the idea.
From the beginning, it was clear that quantum supremacy would not be a milestone like the moon landing—something that’s achieved in a moment, and is then clear to everyone for all time. It would be more like eradicating measles: it could be achieved, then temporarily unachieved, then re-achieved. For by definition, quantum supremacy all about beating something—namely, classical computation—and the latter can, at least for a while, fight back.
As Boaz Barak put it to me, the current contest between IBM and Google is analogous to Kasparov versus Deep Blue—except with the world-historic irony that IBM is playing the role of Kasparov! In other words, Kasparov can put up a heroic struggle, during a “transitional period” that lasts a year or two, but the fundamentals of the situation are that he’s toast. If Kasparov had narrowly beaten Deep Blue in 1997, rather than narrowly losing, the whole public narrative would likely have been different (“humanity triumphs over computers after all!”). Yet as Kasparov himself well knew, the very fact that the contest was close meant that, either way, human dominance would soon end for good.
Let me leave the last word on this to friend-of-the-blog Greg Kuperberg, who graciously gave me permission to quote his comments about the IBM paper.
I’m not entirely sure how embarrassed Google should feel that they overlooked this. I’m sure that they would have been happier to anticipate it, and happier still if they had put more qubits on their chip to defeat it. However, it doesn’t change their real achievement.
I respect the IBM paper, even if the press along with it seems more grouchy than necessary. I tend to believe them that the Google team did not explore all avenues when they said that their 53 qubits aren’t classically simulable. But if this is the best rebuttal, then you should still consider how much Google and IBM still agree on this as a proof-of-concept of QC. This is still quantum David vs classical Goliath, in the extreme. 53 qubits is in some ways still just 53 bits, only enhanced with quantum randomness. To answer those 53 qubits, IBM would still need entire days of computer time with the world’s fastest supercomputer, a 200-petaflop machine with hundreds of thousands of processing cores and trillions of high-speed transistors. If we can confirm that the Google chip actually meets spec, but we need this much computer power to do it, then to me that’s about as convincing as a larger quantum supremacy demonstration that humanity can no longer confirm at all.
Honestly, I’m happy to give both Google and IBM credit for helping the field of QC, even if it is the result of a strange dispute.
I should mention that, even before IBM’s announcement, Johnnie Gray, a postdoc at Imperial College, gave a talk (abstract here) at Caltech’s Institute for Quantum Information with a proposal for a different faster way to classically simulate quantum circuits like Google’s—in this case, by doing tensor network contraction more cleverly. Unlike both IBM’s proposed brute-force simulation, and the Schrödinger-Feynman algorithm that Google implemented, Gray’s algorithm (as far as we know now) would need to be repeated k times if you wanted k independent samples from the hard distribution. Partly because of this issue, Gray’s approach doesn’t currently look competitive for simulating thousands or millions of samples, but we’ll need to watch it and see what happens.
(2) Direct versus indirect verification.
The discussion of IBM’s proposed simulation brings us to a curious aspect of the Google paper—one that was already apparent when Nature sent me the paper for review back in August. Namely, Google took its supremacy experiments well past the point where even they themselves knew how to verify the results, by any classical computation that they knew how to perform feasibly (say, in less than 10,000 years).
So you might reasonably ask: if they couldn’t even verify the results, then how did they get to claim quantum speedups from those experiments? Well, they resorted to various gambits, which basically involved estimating the fidelity on quantum circuits that looked almost the same as the hard circuits, but happened to be easier to simulate classically, and then making the (totally plausible) assumption that that fidelity would be maintained on the hard circuits. Interestingly, they also cached their outputs and put them online (as part of the supplementary material to their Nature paper), in case it became feasible to verify them in the future.
Maybe you can now see where this is going. From Google’s perspective, IBM’s rainstorm comes with a big silver lining. Namely, by using Summit, hopefully it will now be possible to verify Google’s hardest (53-qubit and depth-20) sampling computations directly! This should provide an excellent test, since not even the Google group themselves would’ve known how to cheat and bias the results had they wanted to.
This whole episode has demonstrated the importance, when doing a sampling-based quantum supremacy experiment, of going deep into the regime where you can no longer classically verify the outputs, as weird as that sounds. Namely, you need to leave yourself a margin, in the likely event that the classical algorithms improve!
Having said that, I don’t mind revealing at this point that the lack of direct verification of the outputs, for the largest reported speedups, was my single biggest complaint when I reviewed Google’s Nature submission. It was because of my review that they added a paragraph explicitly pointing out that they did do direct verification for a smaller quantum speedup:
The largest circuits for which the fidelity can still be directly verified have 53 qubits and a simplified gate arrangement. Performing random circuit sampling on these at 0.8% fidelity takes one million cores 130 seconds, corresponding to a million-fold speedup of the quantum processor relative to a single core.
(An earlier version of this post misstated the numbers involved.)
(3) The asymptotic hardness of spoofing Google’s benchmark.
OK, but if Google thought that spoofing its test would take 10,000 years, using the best known classical algorithms running on the world’s top supercomputers, and it turns out instead that it could probably be done in more like 2.5 days, then how much else could’ve been missed? Will we find out next that Google’s benchmark can be classically spoofed in mere milliseconds?
Well, no one can rule that out, but we do have some reasons to think that it’s unlikely—and crucially, that even if it turned out to be true, one would just have to add 10 or 20 or 30 more qubits to make it no longer true. (We can’t be more definitive than that? Aye, such are the perils of life at a technological inflection point—and of computational complexity itself.)
The key point to understand here is that we really are talking about simulating a random quantum circuit, with no particular structure whatsoever. While such problems might have a theoretically efficient classical algorithm—i.e., one that runs in time polynomial in the number of qubits—I’d personally be much less surprised if you told me there was a polynomial-time classical algorithm for factoring. In the universe where amplitudes of random quantum circuits turn out to be efficiently computable—well, you might as well just tell me that P=PSPACE and be done with it.
Crucially, if you look at IBM’s approach to simulating quantum circuits classically, and Johnnie Gray’s approach, and Google’s approach, they could all be described as different flavors of “brute force.” That is, they all use extremely clever tricks to parallelize, shave off constant factors, make the best use of available memory, etc., but none involves any deep new mathematical insight that could roust BPP and BQP and the other complexity gods from their heavenly slumber. More concretely, none of these approaches seem to have any hope of “breaching the 2n barrier,” where n is the number of qubits in the quantum circuit to be simulated (assuming that the circuit depth is reasonably large). Mostly, they’re just trying to get down to that barrier, while taking the maximum advantage of whatever storage and connectivity and parallelism are there.
Ah, but at the end of the day, we only believe that Google’s Sycamore chip is solving a classically hard problem because of the statistical test that Google applies to its outputs: the so-called “Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark,” which I described in Q3 of my FAQ. And even if we grant that calculating the output probabilities for a random quantum circuit is almost certainly classically hard, and sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit is almost certainly classically hard—still, couldn’t spoofing Google’s benchmark be classically easy?
This last question is where complexity theory can contribute something to the story. A couple weeks ago, UT undergraduate Sam Gunn and I adapted the hardness analysis from my and Lijie Chen’s 2017 paper “Complexity-Theoretic Foundations of Quantum Supremacy Experiments,” to talk directly about the classical hardness of spoofing the Linear Cross-Entropy benchmark. Our short paper about this
should be on the arXiv later this week (or early next week, given that there are no arXiv updates on Friday or Saturday nights) here it is.
Briefly, Sam and I show that if you had a sub-2n classical algorithm to spoof the Linear Cross-Entropy benchmark, then you’d also have a sub-2n classical algorithm that, given as input a random quantum circuit, could estimate a specific output probability (for example, that of the all-0 string) with variance at least slightly (say, Ω(2-3n)) better than that of the trivial estimator that just always guesses 2-n. Or in other words: we show that spoofing Google’s benchmark is no easier than the general problem of nontrivially estimating amplitudes in random quantum circuits. Furthermore, this result automatically generalizes to the case of noisy circuits: all that the noise affects is the threshold for the Linear Cross-Entropy benchmark, and thus (indirectly) the number of samples one needs to take with the QC. Our result helps to explain why, indeed, neither IBM nor Johnnie Gray nor anyone else suggested any attack that’s specific to Google’s Linear Cross-Entropy benchmark: they all simply attack the general problem of calculating the final amplitudes.
(4) Why use Linear Cross-Entropy at all?
In the comments of my FAQ, some people wondered why Google chose the Linear Cross-Entropy benchmark specifically—especially since they’d used a different benchmark (multiplicative cross-entropy, which unlike the linear version actually is a cross-entropy) in their earlier papers. I asked John Martinis this question, and his answer was simply that linear cross-entropy had the lowest variance of any estimator they tried. Since I also like linear cross-entropy—it turns out, for example, to be convenient for the analysis of my certified randomness protocol—I’m 100% happy with their choice. Having said that, there are many other choices of benchmark that would’ve also worked fine, and with roughly the same level of theoretical justification.
(5) Controlled-Z versus iSWAP gates.
Another interesting detail from the Google paper is that, in their previous hardware, they could implement a particular 2-qubit gate called the Controlled-Z. For their quantum supremacy demonstration, on the other hand, they modified their hardware to implement a different 2-qubit gate called the
iSWAP some weird combination of iSWAP and Controlled-Z; see the comments section for more. Now, this other gate has no known advantages over the Controlled-Z, for any applications like quantum simulation or Shor’s algorithm or Grover search. Why then did Google make the switch? Simply because, with certain classical simulation methods that they’d been considering, the simulation’s running time grows like 4 to the power of the number of these other gates, but only like 2 to the power of the number of Controlled-Z gates! In other words, they made this engineering choice purely and entirely to make a classical simulation of their device sweat more. This seems totally fine and entirely within the rules to me. (Alas, this choice has no effect on a proposed simulation method like IBM’s.)
(6) Gil Kalai’s objections.
Over the past month, Shtetl-Optimized regular and noted quantum computing skeptic Gil Kalai has been posting one objection to the Google experiment after another on his blog. Unlike the IBM group and many of Google’s other critics, Gil completely accepts the centrality of quantum supremacy as a goal. Indeed, he’s firmly predicted for years that quantum supremacy could never be achieved for fundamental reasons—and he agrees that the Google result, if upheld, would refute his worldview. Gil also has no dispute with the exponential classical hardness of the problem that Google is solving.
Instead, Gil—if we’re talking not about “steelmanning” his beliefs, but about what he himself actually said—has taken the position that the Google experiment must’ve been done wrong and will need to be retracted. He’s offered varying grounds for this. First he said that Google never computed the full histogram of probabilities with a smaller number of qubits (for which such an experiment is feasible), which would be an important sanity check. Except, it turns out they did do that, and it’s in their 2018 Science paper. Next he said that the experiment is invalid because the qubits have to be calibrated in a way that depends on the specific circuit to be applied. Except, this too turns out to be false: John Martinis explicitly confirmed for me that once the qubits are calibrated, you can run any circuit on them that you want. In summary, unlike the objections of the IBM group, so far I’ve found Gil’s objections to be devoid of scientific interest or merit.
Update #1: Alas, I’ll have limited availability today for answering comments, since we’ll be grading the midterm exam for my Intro to Quantum Information Science course! I’ll try to handle the backlog tomorrow (Thursday).
Update #2: Aaannd … timed to coincide with the Google paper, last night the group of Jianwei Pan and Chaoyang Lu put up a preprint on the arXiv reporting a BosonSampling experiment with
20 photons 14 photons observed out of 20 generated (the previous record had been 6 photons). At this stage of the quantum supremacy race, many had of course written off BosonSampling—or said that its importance was mostly historical, in that it inspired Google’s random circuit sampling effort. I’m thrilled to see BosonSampling itself take such a leap; hopefully, this will eventually lead to a demonstration that BosonSampling was (is) a viable pathway to quantum supremacy as well. And right now, with fault-tolerance still having been demonstrated in zero platforms, we need all the viable pathways we can get. What an exciting day for the field.",22280,"['dbbae9e90b19e8631e35c1dd2ec2c3838ad9d4df88aaff8bda25a36d7f0effd3', 'f159f7f4334d93adb08a29a01b115ee64f4ad4af98b39e00bff18fd2cd5e2cf5',

84,4317,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4317,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2019-09-23,Scott Aaronson,Scott’s Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ!,"You’ve seen the stories—in the Financial Times, Technology Review, CNET, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, or elsewhere—saying that a group at Google has now achieved quantum computational supremacy with a 53-qubit superconducting device. While these stories are easy to find, I’m not going to link to them here, for the simple reason that none of them were supposed to exist yet.
As the world now knows, Google is indeed preparing a big announcement about quantum supremacy, to coincide with the publication of its research paper in a high-profile journal (which journal? you can probably narrow it down to two). This will hopefully happen within a month.
Meanwhile, though, NASA, which has some contributors to the work, inadvertently posted an outdated version of the Google paper on a public website. It was there only briefly, but long enough to make it to the Financial Times, my inbox, and millions of other places. Fact-free pontificating about what it means has predictably proliferated.
The world, it seems, is going to be denied its clean “moon landing” moment, wherein the Extended Church-Turing Thesis gets experimentally obliterated within the space of a press conference. This is going to be more like the Wright Brothers’ flight—about which rumors and half-truths leaked out in dribs and drabs between 1903 and 1908, the year Will and Orville finally agreed to do public demonstration flights. (This time around, though, it thankfully won’t take that long to clear everything up!)
I’ve known about what was in the works for a couple months now; it was excruciating not being able to blog about it. Though sworn to secrecy, I couldn’t resist dropping some hints here and there (did you catch any?)—for example, in my recent Bernays Lectures in Zürich, a lecture series whose entire structure built up to the brink of this moment.
This post is not an official announcement or confirmation of anything. Though the lightning may already be visible, the thunder belongs to the group at Google, at a time and place of its choosing.
Rather, because so much misinformation is swirling around, what I thought I’d do here, in my role as blogger and “public intellectual,” is offer Scott’s Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ. You know, just in case you were randomly curious about the topic of quantum supremacy, or wanted to know what the implications would be if some search engine company based in Mountain View or wherever were hypothetically to claim to have achieved quantum supremacy.
Without further ado, then:
Q1. What is quantum computational supremacy?
Often abbreviated to just “quantum supremacy,” the term refers to the use of a quantum computer to solve some well-defined set of problems that would take orders of magnitude longer to solve with any currently known algorithms running on existing classical computers—and not for incidental reasons, but for reasons of asymptotic quantum complexity. The emphasis here is on being as sure as possible that the problem really was solved quantumly and really is classically intractable, and ideally achieving the speedup soon (with the noisy, non-universal QCs of the present or very near future). If the problem is also useful for something, then so much the better, but that’s not at all necessary. The Wright Flyer and the Fermi pile weren’t useful in themselves.
Q2. If Google has indeed achieved quantum supremacy, does that mean that now “no code is uncrackable”, as Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang recently tweeted?
No, it doesn’t. (But I still like Yang’s candidacy.)
There are two issues here. First, the devices currently being built by Google, IBM, and others have 50-100 qubits and no error-correction. Running Shor’s algorithm to break the RSA cryptosystem would require several thousand logical qubits. With known error-correction methods, that could easily translate into millions of physical qubits, and those probably of a higher quality than any that exist today. I don’t think anyone is close to that, and we have no idea how long it will take.
But the second issue is that, even in a hypothetical future with scalable, error-corrected QCs, on our current understanding they’ll only be able to crack some codes, not all of them. By an unfortunate coincidence, the public-key codes that they can crack include most of what we currently use to secure the Internet: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, elliptic curve crypto, etc. But symmetric-key crypto should only be minimally affected. And there are even candidates for public-key cryptosystems (for example, based on lattices) that no one knows how to break quantumly after 20+ years of trying, and some efforts underway now to start migrating to those systems. For more, see for example my letter to Rebecca Goldstein.
Q3. What calculation is Google planning to do, or has it already done, that’s believed to be classically hard?
So, I can tell you, but I’ll feel slightly sheepish doing so. The calculation is: a “challenger” generates a random quantum circuit C (i.e., a random sequence of 1-qubit and nearest-neighbor 2-qubit gates, of depth perhaps 20, acting on a 2D grid of n = 50 to 60 qubits). The challenger then sends C to the quantum computer, and asks it apply C to the all-0 initial state, measure the result in the {0,1} basis, send back whatever n-bit string was observed, and repeat some thousands or millions of times. Finally, using its knowledge of C, the classical challenger applies a statistical test to check whether the outputs are consistent with the QC having done this.
So, this is not a problem like factoring with a single right answer. The circuit C gives rise to some probability distribution, call it DC, over n-bit strings, and the problem is to output samples from that distribution. In fact, there will typically be 2n strings in the support of DC—so many that, if the QC is working as expected, the same output will never be observed twice. A crucial point, though, is that the distribution DC is not uniform. Some strings enjoy constructive interference of amplitudes and therefore have larger probabilities, while others suffer destructive interference and have smaller probabilities. And even though we’ll only see a number of samples that’s tiny compared to 2n, we can check whether the samples preferentially cluster among the strings that are predicted to be likelier, and thereby build up our confidence that something classically intractable is being done.
So, tl;dr, the quantum computer is simply asked to apply a random (but known) sequence of quantum operations—not because we intrinsically care about the result, but because we’re trying to prove that it can beat a classical computer at some well-defined task.
Q4. But if the quantum computer is just executing some random garbage circuit, whose only purpose is to be hard to simulate classically, then who cares? Isn’t this a big overhyped nothingburger?
No. As I put it the other day, it’s not an everythingburger, but it’s certainly at least a somethingburger!
It’s like, have a little respect for the immensity of what we’re talking about here, and for the terrifying engineering that’s needed to make it reality. Before quantum supremacy, by definition, the QC skeptics can all laugh to each other that, for all the billions of dollars spent over 20+ years, still no quantum computer has even once been used to solve any problem faster than your laptop could solve it, or at least not in any way that depended on its being a quantum computer. In a post-quantum-supremacy world, that’s no longer the case. A superposition involving 250 or 260 complex numbers has been computationally harnessed, using time and space resources that are minuscule compared to 250 or 260.
I keep bringing up the Wright Flyer only because the chasm between what we’re talking about, and the dismissiveness I’m seeing in some corners of the Internet, is kind of breathtaking to me. It’s like, if you believed that useful air travel was fundamentally impossible, then seeing a dinky wooden propeller plane keep itself aloft wouldn’t refute your belief … but it sure as hell shouldn’t reassure you either.
Was I right to worry, years ago, that the constant drumbeat of hype about much less significant QC milestones would wear out people’s patience, so that they’d no longer care when something newsworthy finally did happen?
Q5. Years ago, you scolded the masses for being super-excited about D-Wave, and its claims to get huge quantum speedups for optimization problems via quantum annealing. Today you scold the masses for not being super-excited about quantum supremacy. Why can’t you stay consistent?
Because my goal is not to move the “excitement level” in some uniformly preferred direction, it’s to be right! With hindsight, would you say that I was mostly right about D-Wave, even when raining on that particular parade made me unpopular in some circles? Well, I’m trying to be right about quantum supremacy too.
Q6. If quantum supremacy calculations just involve sampling from probability distributions, how do you check that they were done correctly?
Glad you asked! This is the subject of a fair amount of theory that I and others developed over the last decade. I already gave you the short version in my answer to Q3: you check by doing statistics on the samples that the QC returned, to verify that they’re preferentially clustered in the “peaks” of the chaotic probability distribution DC. One convenient way of doing this, which Google calls the “linear cross-entropy test,” is simply to sum up Pr[C outputs si] over all the samples s1,…,sk that the QC returned, and then to declare the test a “success” if and only if the sum exceeds some threshold—say, bk/2n, for some constant b strictly between 1 and 2.
Admittedly, in order to apply this test, you need to calculate the probabilities Pr[C outputs si] on your classical computer—and the only known ways to calculate them require brute force and take ~2n time. Is that a showstopper? No, not if n is 50, and you’re Google and are able to handle numbers like 250 (although not 21000, which exceeds a googol, har har). By running a huge cluster of classical cores for (say) a month, you can eventually verify the outputs that your QC produced in a few seconds—while also seeing that the QC was many orders of magnitude faster. However, this does mean that sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments are almost specifically designed for ~50-qubit devices like the ones being built right now. Even with 100 qubits, we wouldn’t know how to verify the results using all the classical computing power available on earth.
(Let me stress that this issue is specific to sampling experiments like the ones that are currently being done. If Shor’s algorithm factored a 2000-digit number, it would be easy to check the result by simply multiplying the claimed factors and running a primality test on them. Likewise, if a QC were used to simulate some complicated biomolecule, you could check its results by comparing them to experiment.)
Q7. Wait. If classical computers can only check the results of a quantum supremacy experiment, in a regime where the classical computers can still simulate the experiment (albeit extremely slowly), then how do you get to claim “quantum supremacy”?
Come on. With a 53-qubit chip, it’s perfectly feasible to see a speedup by a factor of many millions, in a regime where you can still directly verify the outputs, and also to see that the speedup is growing exponentially with the number of qubits, exactly as asymptotic analysis would predict. This isn’t marginal.
Q8. Is there a mathematical proof that no fast classical algorithm could possibly spoof the results of a sampling-based quantum supremacy experiment?
Not at present. But that’s not quantum supremacy researchers’ fault! As long as theoretical computer scientists can’t even prove basic conjectures like P≠NP or P≠PSPACE, there’s no hope of ruling out a fast classical simulation unconditionally. The best we can hope for are conditional hardness results. And we have indeed managed to prove some such results—see for example the BosonSampling paper, or the Bouland et al. paper on average-case #P-hardness of calculating amplitudes in random circuits, or my paper with Lijie Chen (“Complexity-Theoretic Foundations of Quantum Supremacy Experiments”). The biggest theoretical open problem in this area, in my opinion, is to prove better conditional hardness results.
Q9. Does sampling-based quantum supremacy have any applications in itself?
When people were first thinking about this subject, it seemed pretty obvious that the answer was “no”! (I know because I was one of the people.) Recently, however, the situation has changed—for example, because of my certified randomness protocol, which shows how a sampling-based quantum supremacy experiment could almost immediately be repurposed to generate bits that can be proven to be random to a skeptical third party (under computational assumptions). This, in turn, has possible applications to proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies and other cryptographic protocols. I’m hopeful that more such applications will be discovered in the near future.
Q10. If the quantum supremacy experiments are just generating random bits, isn’t that uninteresting? Isn’t it trivial to convert qubits into random bits, just by measuring them?
The key is that a quantum supremacy experiment doesn’t generate uniform random bits. Instead, it samples from some complicated, correlated probability distribution over 50- or 60-bit strings. In my certified randomness protocol, the deviations from uniformity play a central role in how the QC convinces a classical skeptic that it really was sampling the bits randomly, rather than in some secretly deterministic way (e.g., using a pseudorandom generator).
Q11. Haven’t decades of quantum-mechanical experiments–for example, the ones that violated the Bell inequality–already demonstrated quantum supremacy?
This is purely a confusion over words. Those other experiments demonstrated other forms of “quantum supremacy”: for example, in the case of Bell inequality violations, what you could call “quantum correlational supremacy.” They did not demonstrate quantum computational supremacy, meaning doing something that’s infeasible to simulate using a classical computer (where the classical simulation has no restrictions of spatial locality or anything else of that kind). Today, when people use the phrase “quantum supremacy,” it’s generally short for quantum computational supremacy.
Q12. Even so, there are countless examples of materials and chemical reactions that are hard to classically simulate, as well as special-purpose quantum simulators (like those of Lukin’s group at Harvard). Why don’t these already count as quantum computational supremacy?
Under some people’s definitions of “quantum computational supremacy,” they do! The key difference with Google’s effort is that they have a fully programmable device—one that you can program with an arbitrary sequence of nearest-neighbor 2-qubit gates, just by sending the appropriate signals from your classical computer.
In other words, it’s no longer open to the QC skeptics to sneer that, sure, there are quantum systems that are hard to simulate classically, but that’s just because nature is hard to simulate, and you don’t get to arbitrarily redefine whatever random chemical you find in the wild to be a “computer for simulating itself.” Under any sane definition, the superconducting devices that Google, IBM, and others are now building are indeed “computers.”
Q13. Did you (Scott Aaronson) invent the concept of quantum supremacy?
No. I did play some role in developing it, which led to Sabine Hossenfelder among others generously overcrediting me for the whole idea. The term “quantum supremacy” was coined by John Preskill in 2012, though in some sense the core concept goes back to the beginnings of quantum computing itself in the early 1980s. In 1993, Bernstein and Vazirani explicitly pointed out the severe apparent tension between quantum mechanics and the Extended Church-Turing Thesis of classical computer science. Then, in 1994, the use of Shor’s algorithm to factor a huge number became the quantum supremacy experiment par excellence—albeit, one that’s still (in 2019) much too hard to perform.
The key idea of instead demonstrating quantum supremacy using a sampling problem was, as far as I know, first suggested by Barbara Terhal and David DiVincenzo, in a farsighted paper from 2002. The “modern” push for sampling-based supremacy experiments started around 2011, when Alex Arkhipov and I published our paper on BosonSampling, and (independently of us) Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd published their paper on the commuting Hamiltonians model. These papers showed, not only that “simple,” non-universal quantum systems can solve apparently-hard sampling problems, but also that an efficient classical algorithm for the same sampling problems would imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. Arkhipov and I also made a start toward arguing that even the approximate versions of quantum sampling problems can be classically hard.
As far as I know, the idea of “Random Circuit Sampling”—that is, generating your hard sampling problem by just picking a random sequence of 2-qubit gates in (say) a superconducting architecture—originated in an email thread that I started in December 2015, which also included John Martinis, Hartmut Neven, Sergio Boixo, Ashley Montanaro, Michael Bremner, Richard Jozsa, Aram Harrow, Greg Kuperberg, and others. The thread was entitled “Hard sampling problems with 40 qubits,” and my email began “Sorry for the spam.” I then discussed some advantages and disadvantages of three options for demonstrating sampling-based quantum supremacy: (1) random circuits, (2) commuting Hamiltonians, and (3) BosonSampling. After Greg Kuperberg chimed in to support option (1), a consensus quickly formed among the participants that (1) was indeed the best option from an engineering standpoint—and that, if the theoretical analysis wasn’t yet satisfactory for (1), then that was something we could remedy.
[Update: Sergio Boixo tells me that, internally, the Google group had been considering the idea of random circuit sampling since February 2015, even before my email thread. This doesn’t surprise me: while there are lots of details that had to be worked out, the idea itself is an extremely natural one.]
After that, the Google group did a huge amount of analysis of random circuit sampling, both theoretical and numerical, while Lijie Chen and I and Bouland et al. supplied different forms of complexity-theoretic evidence for the problem’s classical hardness.
Q14. If quantum supremacy was achieved, what would it mean for the QC skeptics?
I wouldn’t want to be them right now! They could retreat to the position that of course quantum supremacy is possible (who ever claimed that it wasn’t? surely not them!), that the real issue has always been quantum error-correction. And indeed, some of them have consistently maintained that position all along. But others, including my good friend Gil Kalai, are on record, right here on this blog predicting that even quantum supremacy can never be achieved for fundamental reasons. I won’t let them wiggle out of it now.
[Update: As many of you will have seen, Gil Kalai has taken the position that the Google result won’t stand and will need to be retracted. He asked for more data: specifically, a complete histogram of the output probabilities for a smaller number of qubits. This turns out to be already available, in a Science paper from 2018.]
Q15. What’s next?
If it’s achieved quantum supremacy, then I think the Google group already has the requisite hardware to demonstrate my protocol for generating certified random bits. And that’s indeed one of the very next things they’re planning to do.
[Addendum: Also, of course, the evidence for quantum supremacy itself can be made stronger and various loopholes closed—for example, by improving the fidelity so that fewer samples need to be taken (something that Umesh Vazirani tells me he’d like to see), by having the circuit C be generated and the outputs verified by a skeptic external to Google. and simply by letting more time pass, so outsiders can have a crack at simulating the results classically. My personal guess is that the basic picture is going to stand, but just like with the first experiments that claimed to violate the Bell inequality, there’s still plenty of room to force the skeptics into a tinier corner.]
Beyond that, one obvious next milestone would be to use a programmable QC, with (say) 50-100 qubits, to do some useful quantum simulation (say, of a condensed-matter system) much faster than any known classical method could do it. A second obvious milestone would be to demonstrate the use of quantum error-correction, to keep an encoded qubit alive for longer than the underlying physical qubits remain alive. There’s no doubt that Google, IBM, and the other players will now be racing toward both of these milestones.
[Update: Steve Girvin reminds me that the Yale group has already achieved quantum error-correction “beyond the break-even point,” albeit in a bosonic system rather than superconducting qubits. So perhaps a better way to phrase the next milestone would be: achieve quantum computational supremacy and useful quantum error-correction in the same

85,4301,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4301,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2019-09-09,Scott Aaronson,Paul Bernays Lectures,"Last week, I had the honor of giving the annual Paul Bernays Lectures at ETH Zürich. My opening line: “as I look at the list of previous Bernays Lecturers—many of them Nobel physics laureates, Fields Medalists, etc.—I think to myself, how badly did you have to screw up this year in order to end up with me?”
Paul Bernays was the primary assistant to David Hilbert, before Bernays (being Jewish by birth) was forced out of Göttingen by the Nazis in 1933. He spent most of the rest of his career at ETH. He’s perhaps best known for the von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel set theory, and for writing (in a volume by “Hilbert and Bernays,” but actually just Bernays) arguably the first full proof of Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem.
Anyway, the idea of the Paul Bernays Lectures is to rotate between Bernays’s different interests in his long, distinguished career—interests that included math, philosophy, logic, and the foundations of physics. I mentioned that, if there’s any benefit to carting me out to Switzerland for these lectures, it’s that quantum computing theory combines all of these interests. And this happens to be the moment in history right before we start finding out, directly from experiments, whether quantum computers can indeed solve certain special problems much faster.
The general theme for my three lectures was “Quantum Computing and the Fundamental Limits of Computation.” The attendance was a few hundred. My idea was to take the audience from Church and Turing in the 1930s, all the way to the quantum computational supremacy experiments that Google and others are doing now—as part of a single narrative.
If you’re interested, streaming video of the lectures is available as of today (though I haven’t watched it—let me know if the quality is OK!), as well as of course my slides. Here you go:
Lecture 1: The Church-Turing Thesis and Physics (watch streaming / PowerPoint slides) (with an intro in German by Giovanni Sommaruga, who knew Bernays, and a second intro in English by Renato Renner, who appeared on this blog here)
Abstract: Is nature computable? What should we even mean in formulating such a question? For generations, the identification of “computable” with “computable by a Turing machine” has been seen as either an arbitrary mathematical definition, or a philosophical or psychological claim. The rise of quantum computing and information, however, has brought a fruitful new way to look at the Church-Turing Thesis: namely, as a falsifiable empirical claim about the physical universe. This talk seeks to examine the computability of the laws of physics from a modern standpoint—one that fully incorporates the insights of quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, quantum gravity, and cosmology. We’ll critically assess ‘hypercomputing’ proposals involving (for example) relativistic time dilation, black holes, closed timelike curves, and exotic cosmologies, and will make a 21st-century case for the physical Church-Turing Thesis.
Abstract: Computer scientists care about what’s computable not only in principle, but within the resource constraints of the physical universe. Closely related, which types of problems are solvable using a number of steps that scales reasonably (say, polynomially) with the problem size? This lecture will examine whether the notorious NP-complete problems, like the Traveling Salesman Problem, are efficiently solvable using the resources of the physical world. We’ll start with P=?NP problem of classical computer science—its meaning, history, and current status. We’ll then discuss quantum computers: how they work, how they can sometimes yield exponential speedups over classical computers, and why many believe that not even they will do so for the NP-complete problems. Finally, we’ll critically assess proposals that would use exotic physics to go even beyond quantum computers, in terms of what they would render computable in polynomial time.
Abstract: Can useful quantum computers be built in our world? This talk will discuss the current status of the large efforts currently underway at Google, IBM, and many other places to build noisy quantum devices, with 50-100 qubits, that can clearly outperform classical computers at least on some specialized tasks — a milestone that’s been given the unfortunate name of “quantum supremacy.” We’ll survey recent theoretical work (on BosonSampling, random circuit sampling, and more) that aims to tell us: which problems should we give these devices, that we’re as confident as possible are hard for classical computers? And how should we check whether the devices indeed solved them? We’ll end by discussing a new protocol, for generating certified random bits, that can be implemented almost as soon as quantum supremacy itself is achieved, and which might therefore become the first application of quantum computing to be realized.
Finally, thanks so much to Giovanni Sommaruga and everyone else at ETH for arranging a fantastic visit.",4968,"['6b6dc39d6074cce046d5865d8f4d55aa4aceef22cc666482c8b91b0038988401', '2436f6141c0fe2e5e44facbe5afe8bc84d2d279793a9aaa9373aabd61bc7cab8', 'c1014c81036bf579715f5b7773d0cebd60ab8bebcdb79932d5fcee890d7d625b', 'f166eb38c14cb8f6e4c32714e49986addc6c0c1db2b6c05f68052dc309ebed96', '0472bb9e909e2567c8284ba9aab2ce10d8bb13a1843beaa445c1d8995dca1321', 'f592bbc1c7034ccc60bf68eb83335548b1470456605b2c6fb1b72d3f8f3b5164', '88a70712fa0ca5aeea9f91538dd47601fde6db513f517ac3367fb43d0e76f823', 'c39239cd5a8fb9ae4e2612bab374e6cac7ab6b43c8228984fa1cf77b58bed96a', 'cf4d93429b08d91dc42d4ba7ea1ec1ea1a991eaf7ba12c3af4b12e60fb02d3ec', '09a01edd9979a3b171cf25408d0f231399f39673ebab08a623ec7317197adca2', 'b47a0e2881e91b46d19c759b9b97ae183dd0fe05761e58ef0644af945b62d8fb', 'c7538ece1180e1c4d944f79d4e3e0a21cfb1ffe28ff94bb5cb1ef0bc0faa4c3f', '32d784ac05bc994fe346402cd6a4f4bd59e4a17aedb0a3dc7c1e67a8462bdbe9', 'd6d7ce102607e65b0e5e2fc6d03692db88e786023beb4b5aabab9f3ba39de291', '43b849f37a5cedfc80f704789913a82382eb8f973afe5ae8b61d12ee05ede9db', '9e583c9416756c8cbdf784243c0201c66a64b3dc222a2141b149fe4c47b6bc06', '7b2a24fb7355f07b43298e52a95026fe89a8087f1bfac6f15d908fd767d4ab36', 'd3cf945577d0ca68fb32f454218347d1cb761fb1321e8c320240be2c9c5197b9', '3e94b58a492fefed61eb00bae36368bf38e76e6fe6c84d173f9b88e62fda8929', '12c599fed88aa7b5c6088c90bc7cd6a50683b326289f9e9eca08957fe07e7b4d', '993ea07b4e6ee4f15c09cc5c20f422f2731849b14b32e7fe7e3d821e78885ff2', '181b8f12756d950a2311ae065d53ff2f3bc1079a42aa1cde940d97fe9d9cb7dc', '2d3644c836a5985c3e8c0408e397cf2e9cfe368108495ff3e4f69f9c4d532999', '9749d94222d47bef82c3f53203792fcd66af42b8d2f69a549712c874abb3403d', '50a40ef2c0b1b7f7b2be880da49a7e038cd439460eab7234e7b15b9bcb4f7768', '748afce0b07b0374049f683e8362d43e674f0abd8258fef5b34a674f3808ce10', '6ab875bf13dfea469800ef2a5fb0e69a420a6b461366b690f7b188d2ebbef1f1', '007fdef00d2c9882db71376e74dd6481679c0f7f61d3b132c19af07db4bf8146', '9bcdb18329677774700d540e58af170e3eb139a20d4227ef7355a4ad17e7f385', '676c99a3411d6f8e062c4b12d7a9ec1f578661be09d5bbe946690b33c2e2b309', 'ede211e38f780fbb5e14aa11e1a8d2e41e1d004822e6568ba9abd134792fc91c', 'd4d64210e301226ec335539b84d14040adc367aadc4302a468c8714c109d51a5', '964a5e50b0836b27d443dda468b6a43506ba8ade7c0f980b32195d3a4ee6186e', '1c3d0e29126b54fccc9a3dad2606d000958ba0979d1c2c6fcb79cbbb72b73efd', 'd5f61104c65c40f3beb2da1acd7a1666d83a8db123dcac5667f5c46860f816c0', 'b6313da3d44ccfbcd39e798f7a84a83a1d59787aa71b673a70fe61724145adea', '25311d458a78eaf3c7132bfc27c578c5ec4daf850c60f8943cd4d59e855fd181', '6875ca6a30679cd1c696f096e04a4793ae9a909f9f665c5189d53be3a6ff79d2', '0013bfaa925cc77f38df538bab759a795cb5d2b544e0e53a8fca5602c7b76b21', 'afe3418e9aead6fc80e2df1c7381ee2ae908d1f4690da4334bd93323eb7c09c1']"

And indeed, a couple days ago Knuth posted his own variant of Huang’s proof on his homepage—in Knuth’s words, fleshing out the argument that Shalev Ben-David previously posted on this blog—and then left a comment about it here, the first comment by Knuth that I know about on this blog or any other blog. I’m honored—although as for whether the variants that avoid the Cauchy Interlacing Theorem are actually “simpler,” I guess I’ll leave that between Huang, Ben-David, Knuth, and God.
In Communications of the ACM, Samuel Greengard has a good, detailed article on Ewin Tang and her dequantization of the quantum recommendation systems algorithm. One warning (with thanks to commenter Ted): the sentence “The only known provable separation theorem between quantum and classical is sqrt(n) vs. n” is mistaken, though it gestures in the direction of a truth. In the black-box setting, we can rigorously prove all sorts of separations: sqrt(n) vs. n (for Grover search), exponential (for period-finding), and more. In the non-black-box setting, we can’t prove any such separations at all.
Last week I returned to the US from the FQXi meeting in the Tuscan countryside. This year’s theme was “Mind Matters: Intelligence and Agency in the Physical World.” I gave a talk entitled “The Search for Physical Correlates of Consciousness: Lessons from the Failure of Integrated Information Theory” (PowerPoint slides here), which reprised my blog posts critical of IIT from five years ago. There were thought-provoking talks by many others who might be known to readers of this blog, including Sean Carroll, David Chalmers, Max Tegmark, Seth Lloyd, Carlo Rovelli, Karl Friston … you can see the full schedule here. Apparently video of the talks is not available yet but will be soon.
Let me close this post by sharing two important new insights about quantum mechanics that emerged from my conversations at the FQXi meeting:
(1) In Hilbert space, no one can hear you scream. Unless, that is, you scream the exact same way everywhere, or unless you split into separate copies, one for each different way of screaming.
(2) It’s true that, as a matter of logic, the Schrödinger equation does not imply the Born Rule. Having said that, if the Schrödinger equation were leading a rally, and the crowd started a chant of “BORN RULE! BORN RULE! BORN RULE!”—the Schrödinger equation would just smile and wait 13 seconds for the chant to die down before continuing.",2724,"['7953adb1c7c2b26f4d5db13ab667824197f41b25b3ef864157f88c43e59f1c96', '3abb204c1a8008c5656d8af4f22243029dadf77c96a6758551c3c304477570fd', '9bf00de1c6526f61cdbad8d5ee766f9585810a94242c907ad0a93f0eefc8040b', '28191cb8bfcbb563e1b6516762540eee82d703dcd851767b262af5e49d72db06', 'a765791da03220789e36e2f7b585e8a84cce933c165e85f5870fb45c30bd6118', '8054d886060989992c541699fd4035819c6b886eb821f2559e0fe36ca789cbc5', '586fb7788dd98b11a5294924eac3281561b3989b024b9c36b65d2115939b8f2f', 'feaf49da7eeca7e2b3db1235cb434f2c9625edbfae6a585ab387d45c9aaef8fe', 'a09c2db7d7f746ed5734d8e6be48eb3d53949ddf8591644d994dc9d3bb7a5b16', '6dd0db53b20ad02729578f9f6148a84995001cd1b1a1eed1ca0fa852aef80b2c', '214f0888b1ff71df9bb3e49273c85eec6028598ee51568f07c37e28aeeb2334a', 'eb5dca2323a30bbad7cdaa890765c79f6ce00e533953ff4dd86f2b5d38bec02c', '3ec0a6dcd40ed0c1dfb18a59982b22f853ff11139f99d2cce4f0e23601ec1b60', 'cbad2cf27d64f60004914009c5b556da911553c81d39464e6323add352411f53', 'd2e9ee64a9bf1b68b33f2ba0d0834f08950d818b4cf24a2b640f05d89da96ad7', '89d59b8391a2db71b4c4faef69d5e31f06d4d9f23f02ac42696887a0650039ec', '8123ccb990c0d6417070d63b0ca513b5058d04cb00a902a455cfeea7d5e65787', '38e64e13a824ae2d4d7c9943a574667b4fb6c402ccf5ac9d8d47f1306304c08d', 'd81abf4d3f51fa4e754afe2fe134b8ac03746608408cca7e39c303800e279083', 'a59d5c8d056a76ffcc104756d46d342be70aab77e74ad2f4e89373d1735617df', 'c6f897724869fb7d956b451c9ff81daebc54692969b9273b972037a475dbaaaf', '20da40b627b5df529699b62db442d4f2c87858a3f8ac5d4487880d1bf154e53b', '2c338a49267737f2e8a45032485b25f5262e288fc2f7bbebb3833355a6902aa8', '151d64719cc20f49bf4a79fd5669e7840ceb7054422346653c53efd4fdd80205', 'a5596ee4bf84ee515a59f42aa15253646625e142ceac458e192b9ee454be55b4', 'e8354ac9e1c93e6ca4be364ba8415232717b73979fda7ef39b47e0e97ac1615e', '82db8008574feb335a758e20e9dc0bf5a65c776d719d168d60d3f89f53bf7463', '984b398a7e7720c872757f642e0efb97f5bceb8851a7e96abab7056c6da7eb0c', '05cba9d544f9de03a6065fdfd8f7da0d87005498d902188ffefbbec63a7d12ba', '9d0c74c69d66c4fd9c741051ff205ea31e9225b43856c082c7359a7e2c8a59d8', '2bf462372f0a884483e777c080d1a45fab26b74b41b10f6fc44e7f709e8fac6b', 'c1eabc201622dafe24d3c45c5fa540902e8b5b4704b0f19f46f6dad986ba7ec8', '5f291b11fec6b97595f8d2868f7c7921f51a9e7da5b5fa9e2aac77127613bcd2', 'de299867c0ee4309780e902bb6c16fc1cf9fe479c51cc5c4d885dc735c93c531', '070e755d092b7eb793c1bb8b8e3a28b2507db67f4aba04f4dea4c0c8ce82fdb2', '4384556dd5ae53841347cf42940e12532d41c94d1e2bddc2b3007773049752b6', '8d707833d17c6c98c9abb6372b48bee9d305f8871e031bb1ecca717754dddc64', '6c02e42f23caef68a0f1dba5a5dd488a172cbc87dfcc93edc4e529ce6cc12d47', '1945efe61268cd5b69a8847da120d7ee6a3ddfc842b9e1153df65ad1190951bb', 'eeae8bf04a74f72b1138391515980f1d699c8cf0b606808eeda1df7890075c3c', '9148eeff32ac331c98b204680d682b002e7a9c476c6d5a77e4474a682e1112aa']"

John made an appearance on this blog a few months ago, when I wrote about the new breakthrough by him and Anand Natarajan: namely, that MIP* (multi-prover interactive proofs with entangled provers) contains NEEXP (nondeterministic double-exponential time). Previously, MIP* had only been known to contain NEXP (nondeterministic single exponential time). So, this is an exponential expansion in the power of entangled provers over what was previously known and believed, and the first proof that entanglement actually increases the power of multi-prover protocols, rather than decreasing it (as it could’ve done a priori). Even more strikingly, there seems to be no natural stopping point: MIP* might soon swallow up arbitrary towers of exponentials or even the halting problem (!). For more, see for example this Quanta article, or this post by Thomas Vidick, or this short story [sic] by Henry Yuen.
John grew up in Texas, so he’s no stranger to BBQ brisket or scorching weather. He did his undergrad in computer science at UT Austin—my colleagues remember him as a star—and then completed his PhD with Ryan O’Donnell at Carnegie Mellon, followed by a postdoc at MIT. Besides the work on MIP*, John is also well-known for his 2015 work with O’Donnell pinning down the sample complexity of quantum state tomography. Their important result, a version of which was independently obtained by Haah et al., says that if you want to learn an unknown d-dimensional quantum mixed state ρ to a reasonable precision, then ~d2 copies of ρ are both necessary and sufficient. This solved a problem that had personally interested me, and already plays a role in, e.g., my work on shadow tomography and gentle measurements.
Our little quantum information center at UT Austin is growing rapidly. Shyam Shankar, a superconducting qubits guy who previously worked in Michel Devoret’s group at Yale, will also be joining UT’s Electrical and Computer Engineering department this fall. I’ll have two new postdocs—Andrea Rocchetto and Yosi Atia—as well as new PhD students. We’ll continue recruiting this coming year, with potential opportunities for students, postdocs, faculty, and research scientists across the CS, physics, and ECE departments as well as the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). I hope you’ll consider applying to join us.
With no evaluative judgment attached, I can honestly say that this is an unprecedented time for quantum computing as a field. Where once faculty applicants struggled to make a case for quantum computing (physics departments: “but isn’t this really CS?” / CS departments: “isn’t it really physics?” / everyone: “couldn’t this whole QC thing, like, all blow over in a year?”), today departments are vying with each other and with industry players and startups to recruit talented people. In such an environment, we’re fortunate to be doing as well as we are. We hope to continue to expand.
Meanwhile, this was an unprecedented year for CS hiring at UT Austin more generally. John Wright is one of at least four new faculty (probably more) who will be joining us. It’s a good time to be in CS.
A huge welcome to John, and hook ’em Hadamards!

Sabine consulted with me by phone before doing the video and post, and despite what some might see as her negative stance, I agree with what she has to say substantially more than I disagree.
I do, however, have a few quibbles:
1. We don’t know that millions of physical qubits will be needed for useful simulations of quantum chemistry. It all depends on how much error correction is needed and how good the error-correcting codes and simulation algorithms become. Like, sure, you can generate pessimistic forecasts by plugging numbers in to the best known codes and algorithms. But “the best known” is a rapidly moving target—one where there have already been orders-of-magnitude improvements in the last decade.
2. To my mind, there’s a big conceptual difference between a single molecule that you can’t efficiently simulate classically, and a programmable computer that you can’t efficiently simulate classically. The difference, in short, is that only for the computer, and not for the molecule, would it ever make sense to say it had given you a wrong answer! In other words, a physical system becomes a “computer” when, and only when, you have sufficient understanding of, and control over, its state space and time evolution that you can ask the system to simulate something other than itself, and then judge whether it succeeded or failed at that goal.
3. The entire point of my recent work, on certified randomness generation (see for example here or here), is that sampling random bits with a NISQ-era device could have a practical application. That application is … I hope you’re sitting down for this … sampling random bits! And then, more importantly and nontrivially, proving to a faraway skeptic that the bits really were randomly generated.
4. While I was involved in some of the first proposals for NISQ quantum supremacy experiments (such as BosonSampling), I certainly can’t take sole credit for the idea of quantum supremacy! The term, incidentally, was coined by John Preskill.
5. The term “NISQ” (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) was also coined by John Preskill. He had no intention of misleading investors—he just needed a term to discuss the quantum computers that will plausibly be available in the near future. As readers of this blog know, there certainly has been some misleading of investors (and journalists, and the public…) about the applications of near-term QCs. But I don’t think you can lay it at the feet of the term “NISQ.”",2678,"['39841819c67b1ef4d6d45fc05f98476eaec72fd8f090fbaa940b93dc0c75003d', '92d1e893cef96f7a158184060b0ab299389243f04b0a54879be0e0ddbca1e7b9', '7f6b30c2e28a7b723df4501c26197b2390d1012c1a1268a5d305b01955f3eb4a', 'c1576415e5ac749f843d27f4834f4993159ef2f65c94d5f11443013b36aa49c9', '06b249355a5491059fcfaa31e83ab01b84345e3db2f1048348ecf9387c183665', 'a6a5e021dcc3eee8b7f10fec59ea3b515e7fb15155476cc147741845da164dbd', '264749982b1ee1c8226460485a051c9b05ea5fd9e5e63f06ad0139f2f1e5578c', 'c5756dcde1007b28a77c5f8b8259e399a11da3f7625edf3b0539afeccab5a631', '9f773c080a43129319870c9684a5e58f4c02224c03cda3e7da7127aac2726a58', '774c4814a93e1a7c1050a309ed56edfb71b6222f3b1565f8fc5a7a72d00809d6', '4db822e08dc735f19ac68f046ac3f50202d5afa849ac9a712fe865638b261c26', '78ad17a1080f0235ac9b8c12587c87b87b885ef21fd55ea9bc65bbfed4ba2c34']"
89,4207,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4207,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2019-06-20,Scott Aaronson,Quanta of Solace,"In Quanta magazine, Kevin Hartnett has a recent article entitled A New Law to Describe Quantum Computing’s Rise? The article discusses “Neven’s Law”—a conjecture, by Hartmut Neven (head of Google’s quantum computing effort), that the number of integrated qubits is now increasing exponentially with time, so that the difficulty of simulating a state-of-the-art QC on a fixed classical computer is increasing doubly exponentially with time. (Jonathan Dowling tells me that he expressed the same thought years ago.)
Near the end, the Quanta piece quotes some UT Austin professor whose surname starts with a bunch of A’s as follows:
“I think the undeniable reality of this progress puts the ball firmly in the court of those who believe scalable quantum computing can’t work. They’re the ones who need to articulate where and why the progress will stop.”
The quote is perfectly accurate, but in context, it might give the impression that I’m endorsing Neven’s Law. In reality, I’m reluctant to fit a polynomial or an exponential or any other curve through a set of numbers that so far hasn’t exceeded about 50. I say only that, regardless of what anyone believes is the ultimate rate of progress in QC, what’s already happened today puts the ball firmly in the skeptics’ court.
Also in Quanta, Anil Ananthaswamy has a new article out on How to Turn a Quantum Computer Into the Ultimate Randomness Generator. This piece covers two schemes for using a quantum computer to generate “certified random bits”—that is, bits you can prove are random to a faraway skeptic. one due to me, the other due to Brakerski et al. The article cites my paper with Lijie Chen, which shows that under suitable computational assumptions, the outputs in my protocol are hard to spoof using a classical computer. The randomness aspect will be addressed in a paper that I’m currently writing; for now, see these slides.
As long as I’m linking to interesting recent Quanta articles, Erica Klarreich has A 53-Year-Old Network Coloring Conjecture is Disproved. Briefly, Hedetniemi’s Conjecture stated that, given any two finite, undirected graphs G and H, the chromatic number of the tensor product G⊗H is just the minimum of the chromatic numbers of G and H themselves. This reasonable-sounding conjecture has now been falsified by Yaroslav Shitov. For more, see also this post by Gil Kalai—who appears here not in his capacity as a quantum computing skeptic.
In interesting math news beyond Quanta magazine, the Berkeley alumni magazine has a piece about the crucial, neglected topic of mathematicians’ love for Hagoromo-brand chalk (hat tip: Peter Woit). I can personally vouch for this. When I moved to UT Austin three years ago, most offices in CS had whiteboards, but I deliberately chose one with a blackboard. I figured that chalk has its problems—it breaks, the dust gets all over—but I could live with them, much more than I could live with the Fundamental Whiteboard Difficulty, of all the available markers always being dry whenever you want to explain anything. With the Hagoromo brand, though, you pretty much get all the benefits of chalk with none of the downsides, so it just strictly dominates whiteboards.
Jan Kulveit asked me to advertise the European Summer Program on Rationality (ESPR), which will take place this August 13-23, and which is aimed at students ages 16-19. I’ve lectured both at ESPR and at a similar summer program that ESPR was modeled after (called SPARC)—and while I was never there as a student, it looked to me like a phenomenal experience. So if you’re a 16-to-19-year-old who reads this blog, please consider applying!
I’m now at the end of my annual family trip to Tel Aviv, returning to the Eastern US tonight, and then on to STOC’2019 at the ACM Federated Computing Research Conference in Phoenix (which I can blog about if anyone wants me to). It was a good trip, although marred by my two-year-old son Daniel falling onto sun-heated metal and suffering a second-degree burn on his leg, and then by the doctor botching the treatment. Fortunately Daniel’s now healing nicely. For future reference, whenever bandaging a burn wound, be sure to apply lots of Vaseline to prevent the bandage from drying out, and also to change the bandage daily.

So in that spirit: a few weeks ago I gave a talk at the Fields Institute in Toronto, at a symposium to celebrate Stephen Cook and the 50th anniversary (or actually more like 48th anniversary) of the discovery of NP-completeness. Thanks so much to the organizers for making this symposium happen.
You can watch the video of my talk here (or read the PowerPoint slides here). The talk, on whether NP-complete problems can be efficiently solved in the physical universe, covers much the same ground as my 2005 survey article on the same theme (not to mention dozens of earlier talks), but this is an updated version and I’m happier with it than I was with most past iterations.
As I explain at the beginning of the talk, I wasn’t going to fly to Toronto at all, due to severe teaching and family constraints—but my wife Dana uncharacteristically urged me to go (“don’t worry, I’ll watch the kids!”). Why? Because in her view, it was the risks that Steve Cook took 50 years ago, as an untenured assistant professor at Berkeley, that gave birth to the field of computational complexity that Dana and I both now work in.
Anyway, be sure to check out the other talks as well—they’re by an assortment of random nobodies like Richard Karp, Avi Wigderson, Leslie Valiant, Michael Sipser, Alexander Razborov, Cynthia Dwork, and Jack Edmonds. I found the talk by Edmonds particularly eye-opening: he explains how he thought about (the objects that we now call) P and NP∩coNP when he first defined them in the early 60s, and how it was similar to and different from the way we think about them today.
Another memorable moment came when Edmonds interrupted Sipser’s talk—about the history of P vs. NP—to deliver a booming diatribe about how what really matters is not mathematical proof, but just how quickly you can solve problems in the real world. Edmonds added that, from a practical standpoint, P≠NP is “true today but might become false in the future.” In response, Sipser asked “what does a mathematician like me care about the real world?,” to roars of approval from the audience. I might’ve picked a different tack—about how for every practical person I meet for whom it’s blindingly obvious that “in real life, P≠NP,” I meet another for whom it’s equally obvious that “in real life, P=NP” (for all the usual reasons: because SAT solvers work so well in practice, because physical systems so easily relax as their ground states, etc). No wonder it took 25+ years of smart people thinking about operations research and combinatorial optimization before the P vs. NP question was even explicitly posed.

- In a piece for Communications of the ACM, Moshe Vardi came out as a “quantum computing skeptic.” But it turns out what he means by that is not that he knows a reason why QC is impossible in principle, but simply that it’s often overhyped and that it will be hard to establish a viable quantum computing industry. By that standard, I’m a “QC skeptic” as well! But then what does that make Gil Kalai or Michel Dyakonov?
- Friend-of-the-blog Bram Cohen asked me to link to this second-round competition for Verifiable Delay Functions, sponsored by his company Chia. Apparently the first link I provided actually mattered in sending serious entrants their way.
- Blogging, it turns out, is really, really hard when (a) your life has become a pile of real-world obligations stretching out to infinity, and also (b) the Internet has become a war zone, with anything you say quote-mined by people looking to embarrass you. But don’t worry, I’ll have more to say soon. In the meantime, doesn’t anyone have more questions about the research papers discussed in the previous post? Y’know, NEEXP in MIP*? SBP versus QMA?

92,4172,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4172,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2019-04-19,Scott Aaronson,Not yet retired from research,"Last night, two papers appeared on the quantum physics arXiv that my coauthors and I have been working on for more than a year, and that I’m pretty happy about.
The first paper, with Guy Rothblum, is Gentle Measurement of Quantum States and Differential Privacy (85 pages, to appear in STOC’2019). This is Guy’s first paper that has anything to do with quantum, and also my first paper that has anything to do with privacy. (What do I care about privacy? I just share everything on this blog…) The paper has its origin when I gave a talk at the Weizmann Institute about “shadow tomography” (a task where you have to measure quantum states very carefully to avoid destroying them), and Guy was in the audience, and he got all excited that the techniques sounded just like what they use to ensure privacy in data-mining, and I figured it was just some wacky coincidence and brushed him off, but he persisted, and it turned out that he was 100% right, and our two fields were often studying the same problems from different angles and we could prove it. Anyway, here’s the abstract:
In differential privacy (DP), we want to query a database about n users, in a way that “leaks at most ε about any individual user,” even conditioned on any outcome of the query. Meanwhile, in gentle measurement, we want to measure n quantum states, in a way that “damages the states by at most α,” even conditioned on any outcome of the measurement. In both cases, we can achieve the goal by techniques like deliberately adding noise to the outcome before returning it. This paper proves a new and general connection between the two subjects. Specifically, we show that on products of n quantum states, any measurement that is α-gentle for small α is also O(α)-DP, and any product measurement that is ε-DP is also O(ε√n)-gentle.
Illustrating the power of this connection, we apply it to the recently studied problem of shadow tomography. Given an unknown d-dimensional quantum state ρ, as well as known two-outcome measurements E1,…,Em, shadow tomography asks us to estimate Pr[Ei accepts ρ], for every i∈[m], by measuring few copies of ρ. Using our connection theorem, together with a quantum analog of the so-called private multiplicative weights algorithm of Hardt and Rothblum, we give a protocol to solve this problem using O((log m)2(log d)2) copies of ρ, compared to Aaronson’s previous bound of ~O((log m)4(log d)). Our protocol has the advantages of being online (that is, the Ei‘s are processed one at a time), gentle, and conceptually simple.
Other applications of our connection include new lower bounds for shadow tomography from lower bounds on DP, and a result on the safe use of estimation algorithms as subroutines inside larger quantum algorithms.
The second paper, with Robin Kothari, UT Austin PhD student William Kretschmer, and Justin Thaler, is Quantum Lower Bounds for Approximate Counting via Laurent Polynomials. Here’s the abstract:
Given only a membership oracle for S, it is well-known that approximate counting takes Θ(√(N/|S|)) quantum queries. But what if a quantum algorithm is also given “QSamples”—i.e., copies of the state |S〉=Σi∈S|i〉—or even the ability to apply reflections about |S〉? Our first main result is that, even then, the algorithm needs either Θ(√(N/|S|)) queries or else Θ(min{|S|1/3,√(N/|S|)}) reflections or samples. We also give matching upper bounds.
We prove the lower bound using a novel generalization of the polynomial method of Beals et al. to Laurent polynomials, which can have negative exponents. We lower-bound Laurent polynomial degree using two methods: a new “explosion argument” that pits the positive- and negative-degree parts of the polynomial against each other, and a new formulation of the dual polynomials method.
Our second main result rules out the possibility of a black-box Quantum Merlin-Arthur (or QMA) protocol for proving that a set is large. More precisely, we show that, even if Arthur can make T quantum queries to the set S⊆[N], and also receives an m-qubit quantum witness from Merlin in support of S being large, we have Tm=Ω(min{|S|,√(N/|S|)}). This resolves the open problem of giving an oracle separation between SBP, the complexity class that captures approximate counting, and QMA.
Note that QMA is “stronger” than the queries+QSamples model in that Merlin’s witness can be anything, rather than just the specific state |S〉, but also “weaker” in that Merlin’s witness cannot be trusted. Intriguingly, Laurent polynomials also play a crucial role in our QMA lower bound, but in a completely different manner than in the queries+QSamples lower bound. This suggests that the “Laurent polynomial method” might be broadly useful in complexity theory.
I need to get ready for our family’s Seder now, but after that, I’m happy to answer any questions about either of these papers in the comments.
Meantime, the biggest breakthrough in quantum complexity theory of the past month isn’t either of the above: it’s the paper by Anand Natarajan and John Wright showing that MIP*, or multi-prover interactive proof systems with entangled provers, contains NEEXP, or nondeterministic doubly-exponential time (!!).

It occurred to me that we could do something analogous for quantum computing.

If you’re simulating a time-reversible process on your computer, then you can ‘reverse the direction of time’ by simply reversing the direction of your simulation. From a quick look at the paper, I confess that I didn’t understand how this becomes more profound if the simulation is being done on IBM’s quantum computer.
Incredibly, the time-reversal claim has now gotten uncritical attention in Newsweek, Discover, Cosmopolitan, my Facebook feed, and elsewhere—hence this blog post, which has basically no content except “the claim to have ‘reversed time,’ by running a simulation backwards, is exactly as true and as earth-shattering as a layperson might think it is.”
If there’s anything interesting here, I suppose it’s just that “scientists use a quantum computer to reverse time” is one of the purest examples I’ve ever seen of a scientific claim that basically amounts to a mind-virus or meme optimized for sharing on social media—discarding all nontrivial “science payload” as irrelevant to its propagation.",1440,"['5a0b20e3fc060d9c68ffe29a3a653051ea3b8beacc79b09853366fb2efd05c8a', '5cad858e362ed4e532399f74282d98f3a0ef07793542c369b9d5b4763e2053cb', 'b7afae6b4cdef7ea1ee80b3f04b70f2f29e9c3471fb6fc62d4a9aa88ee888299', 'e60aaf42805748f06a58d06174c664a6511d4ea3ee4ac5b4ebca919d08698331', '01c0286418a45aec9e649292c6d93a88db756a8208e60e5324bc6d881cf60d64', 'd9473fb6adc1f6c38ac6b1b2dacd74e4842505ede12c0db7f717f9a534987fa3', '1e9ca61bd9587e283ed4a5f6219f3dcebd00666647effacf7b06d06a01e3aa05', '5f186d8279b33ce2721c643cae29bfb72b09baef8a6d8c5f4afabba759538c99', '100f5694c3d0aef48fb836a960302b43813833d75e9d0c8b99d6e55b382727ea', '55cc56ed62faaf844ed32d425aa6a6f33e7a2481ba06e1be5fbd3ed00537abd9', 'f639ea91545957e7ca4a7cb41437f76ec85d228e37715f8bd0eb3512573a4cf0', 'defa7dffc3559611a0cc3ebbf69f5bd07cf242458c2a6edc549193bf2434a347', 'f5e942c9eb4ed09747cbb289a078e4258b5a6e6080103e2e1d21e80d376d221c', 'de568b65338bfbaceca0eb1bf2823e76cd5fb08f4e132f8748472ef558f91018', '2dda5deaa4ebf6278e152efaef50d5f4ac8ee81b2ef7934056f96a8c8e82c888', '2007c83407db3991df65d414a46e50aa0ecc2dc6c1d02a04eeb2d19417ade9b0', 'fe8673c4a2abdff95873aac3857c891be97838e4d76a4fb08890cba8e2b8c76d', 'a761cad39d1b961b0d3d14aeea2a8372475c9a4b1a3da3b310551caf8647a4be', '7b9606e50d8141599b401689a04b83187b490905f683184e2b02cfcc34002d40', '2c475af128faec8e50bcf067718b18fcedf9a0774c7adcaecec3dc9fffdbaef2', '27e18990995dc1a567104caab9d31aa69f447f39496eb2af75689cca4b999489', '6151c0f69a7c711dbf4d72cd909e052ca80fb48e4def757eb2c19a11d7b4dc49', '2af3eb31eadac1b4c94c7f8585ba4f5a436ddb47b4fbd1a7ac5f4b038a657930', 'ae6e6d232a53b84efae715d94b27b212d206ed10c7c68d527cc94d12d2238cad', '64c0ef4f19429714c1802a39c085eafa7f1516be145dbf13e00509d5e7742163', 'f01dd673f26f378cb7099ed2977f9af5fe3cff0989e2da1f66db050b8b47c8dd', '62276f4befb501df53023501138631dc2e2cda1a257fb3b4ea83b961c7f09536', '7b0bb4254ab2e6f6d5b337670acae7d69be6c329817bacb2d38159b33aec1968', 'ad766157917b46d7b56d60547bbc090b2f23eb460ad06efe983eaa58e69ea549', 'bc7c3b1e74a436303d7f95a28fd8ae8d4ecdd6ebfda12cddb2c116e88f2877c3', 'b881845cf8174b75ebe133c0e643cc7b836518a41dbaa4b32ab82816d08a1ccb', '25be8833140de0fbe5a92924e53a9f2ed18ad8f681e5872abfa986172cf029b3', '87d6930a2c35ff9b24f7f11a944c697bd98fe8740659ff9d26281d77163a7676', '6d009b7b5ccca5fc7c1333aaa5b3b51a11f6bd08591683ed9ca6ba771af2ba5a', '299a9d8526775a49f71f85f6fb7fa14250605c329f468e751c1f96735c03e51e', '04182f36a39fd1c31002ed277b47f37044a40306299ed4183cd0f38ae098789b', '89345bd298aadfd239b8a2ad1544c404e6a94205d98f195e703f945a69a7ba08', '268b33526627e67e3e4753a5f7bc567e2c798a4b724da21092c819c3cf7887d2', '7a36f02255397d8fd831cf20f411ba9ee7bd4c2bc1897a994bf34d21eb12be63', 'ada55e8cb17e3ddfeed2d540be747b2aab6cb7c8ec2e7fa85d81d237a0e185bd', '6cfa6ef50d2432d66e680f6bdcc211ffa69fcbfdfddb995d27f5c57b3b0f072a', 'b1a43a226a5efa1bb0ecb39c535b49fb216ecb34de8ee8f9c0e15cb61b0f29a0']"

Throughout my 9 years at MIT, Manolis was one of my best friends there, even though our research styles and interests might seem distant. He and I were in the same PECASE class; see if you can spot us both in this photo (in the rows behind America’s last sentient president). My and Manolis’s families also became close after we both got married and had kids. We still keep in touch.
Today Manolis will be celebrating his 42nd birthday, with a symposium on the meaning of life (!). He asked his friends and colleagues to contribute talks and videos reflecting on that weighty topic.
Here’s a 15-minute video interview that Manolis and I recorded last night, where he asks me to pontificate about the implications of quantum mechanics for consciousness and free will and whether the universe is a computer simulation—and also about, uh, how to balance blogging with work and family.
Also, here’s a 2-minute birthday video that I made for Manolis before I really understood what he wanted. Unlike the first video, this one has no academic content, but it does involve me wearing a cowboy hat and swinging a makeshift “lasso.”

Obvious highlights of the conference include Urmila Mahadev’s opening plenary talk on her verification protocol for quantum computation (which I blogged about here), and Avishay Tal’s upcoming plenary on his and Ran Raz’s oracle separation between BQP and PH (which I blogged about here). If you care, here are the slides for the talk I just gave, on the paper “Online Learning of Quantum States” by me, Xinyi Chen, Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale, and Ashwin Nayak. Feel free to ask in the comments about what else is going on.
I returned a few days ago from my whirlwind Australia tour, which included Melbourne and Sydney; a Persian wedding that happened to be held next to a pirate ship (the Steve Irwin, used to harass whalers and adorned with a huge Jolly Roger); meetings and lectures graciously arranged by friends at UTS; a quantum computing lab tour personally conducted by 2018 “Australian of the Year” Michelle Simmons; three meetups with readers of this blog (or more often, readers of the other Scott A’s blog who graciously settled for the discount Scott A); and an excursion to Grampians National Park to see wild kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, and emus.
But the thing that happened in Australia that provided the actual occassion for this post is this: I was interviewed by Adam Ford in Carlton Gardens in Melbourne, about quantum supremacy, AI risk, Integrated Information Theory, whether the universe is discrete or continuous, and to be honest I don’t remember what else. You can watch the first segment, the one about the prospects for quantum supremacy, here on YouTube. My only complaint is that Adam’s video camera somehow made me look like an out-of-shape slob who needs to hit the gym or something.
And now Adam has posted yet a third segment, in which I talk about small, lighthearted things like existential threats to civilization and the prospects for superintelligent AI.
And a fourth, in which I talk about whether reality is discrete or continuous.
Related to the “free will / consciousness” segment of the interview: the biologist Jerry Coyne, whose blog “Why Evolution Is True” I’ve intermittently enjoyed over the years, yesterday announced my existence to his readers, with a post that mostly criticizes my views about free will and predictability, as I expressed them years ago in a clip that’s on YouTube (at the time, Coyne hadn’t seen GIQTM or my other writings on the subject). Coyne also took the opportunity to poke fun at this weird character he just came across whose “life is devoted to computing” and who even mistakes tips for change at airport smoothie stands. Some friends here at QIP had a good laugh over the fact that, for the world beyond theoretical computer science and quantum information, this is what 23 years of research, teaching, and writing apparently boil down to: an 8.5-minute video clip where I spouted about free will, and also my having been arrested once in a comic mix-up at Philadelphia airport. Anyway, since then I had a very pleasant email exchange with Coyne—someone with whom I find myself in agreement much more often than not, and who I’d love to have an extended conversation with sometime despite the odd way our interaction started.",3252,"['4acea77f24a3b02314feb40d6989434c13e4394592ce9ba48c57051b5991f9c2', 'b629779a282c854051252f070c34b5c2781f00fc50b9a049dc48a5830cd113de', '19d5e00e1bb07d89a52ee7919c2b3b465286fda00b8c8f9ce257aa209edb5cb9', '926197b789086d0e1178ed3677cfd321ce74388884fb8179ad38a6bdc9fe45e6', '31d3b76e072a1eadf64d5dcff8cd8092257edc3e4dee1ffee5621cd7e8bf42e4', '2ae6bc6c24901f67c0acbf3a2252e26ad09acb74d0eb453147211a010a01842f', '32021846daadab1ecbc3db946e0bb1fe76f91373095b3dae7b023d3a32ab7983', '7e405df1e7c1096c8e048daeb326bd117f3b53cc5b91c1b862cbe0ac2f6ed6c6', '54d725f0b6a1624bfb488d9b3cd1d168047c7b18ae1f7b1867313ccd98419c69', 'c877382d181742616f6c911a9cb4db3b3cb9eda8bae92a271b603e58854197dd', '536e3a95401e0b55ab11519319ca845b4cddb260610aaae26e6fcaa4459e51ed', '799605895b32282797b7c4beb383c6548a2c1879b9e1ad269f4e4127819213f7', '31721f641c93679b7917b1f4bb50cf94aa1c9b4bd0b5f91e71072d1f9a5961e7', 'ef8e904475fc5e5c4fc671f31071c17ae3bd37b286862805f8889d682e431ecb', '7f8f1cebc9c8fa434fe31785701cfcf23925fce38bef6d2bcfc195745d11c691', '40e31a5c4d91bb5c8d30274167adeeb522189e25c42597c17f2c8d6e8a27ec5a', '9738d49199f52aa1f13b2dfd25d8d709609b55abbf5768b4ad022623890a50e6', 'b857634e6197720a33ce4720536e2b392b9cb5eaff5569abd8afc378b6155168', 'ed913eb999cc51743b8e584c91c726776dc9c2e68df70b940f36e813cbf13886', '749da5ecac4457b6546b2796ce540888fcad15480373f1255c2aeae246dee700', '33b16ed91decd4c39a3bb4ddb32172fa0ca22d04be88ea4a83d80050897d5036', '6e58adbfcb52b67d19c76fc554d06c7fe7a87fea10a5d8316165ee3e4d524eba', 'c545fd605288ea355f56d733574550db0007836401cbd2185bb7ac2349233705', '74b14dec6d4477749d17f2c56064b08831c735cbab7cdaf12ed395d6352d4e28', '0c7a0b3ae4a128d97c054ce0252e5d3a03259c250ac3671c5bb285985b249b44', '691d76740e1b84225b1400765ef09fbb7ba2432d9c51caa7c798dc16d31fa524', 'c4271bc362e9396526fe46d06cc2d3cf454700e7d57143004b61f06db14ee3b4', 'eea6a03f5306ec135211b4b15f67ef8631f4ee25ee9c4bd3223ef39c9ea80e9a', 'b626c7562fee3cc76306f9af1e1b11aa5c90d2590138f9367d4842e5d82a72e2', '37aa54e4d6595bafb5b6b1f6146dcbe8a9581b9732ed199790228bfd7380f063', 'e187e3d65faca5fa7cd60306333386debec07cf3d1b4f9725ff336bbf63860d5', 'e187e3d65faca5fa7cd60306333386debec07cf3d1b4f9725ff336bbf63860d5']"

It does, however, contain many examples that might be fun to implement in Q#!]
Why should Nature have been quantum-mechanical? It’s totally unclear what would count as an answer to such a question, and also totally clear that people will never stop asking it.
Short of an ultimate answer, we can at least try to explain why, if you want this or that piece of quantum mechanics, then the rest of the structure is inevitable: why quantum mechanics is an “island in theoryspace,” as I put it in 2003.
In this post, I’d like to focus on a question that any “explanation” for QM at some point needs to address, in a non-question-begging way: why should amplitudes have been complex numbers? When I was a grad student, it was his relentless focus on that question, and on others in its vicinity, that made me a lifelong fan of Chris Fuchs (see for example his samizdat), despite my philosophical differences with him.
It’s not that complex numbers are a bad choice for the foundation of the deepest known description of the physical universe—far from it! (They’re a field, they’re algebraically closed, they’ve got a norm, how much more could you want?) It’s just that they seem like a specific choice, and not the only possible one. There are also the real numbers, for starters, and in the other direction, the quaternions.
Quantum mechanics over the reals or the quaternions still has constructive and destructive interference among amplitudes, and unitary transformations, and probabilities that are absolute squares of amplitudes. Moreover, these variants turn out to lead to precisely the same power for quantum computers—namely, the class BQP—as “standard” quantum mechanics, the one over the complex numbers. So none of those are relevant differences.
Indeed, having just finished teaching an undergrad Intro to Quantum Information course, I can attest that the complex nature of amplitudes is needed only rarely—shockingly rarely, one might say—in quantum computing and information. Real amplitudes typically suffice. Teleportation, superdense coding, the Bell inequality, quantum money, quantum key distribution, the Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani and Simon and Grover algorithms, quantum error-correction: all of those and more can be fully explained without using a single i that’s not a summation index. (Shor’s factoring algorithm is an exception; it’s much more natural with complex amplitudes. But as the previous paragraph implied, their use is removable even there.)
It’s true that, if you look at even the simplest “real” examples of quantum systems—or as a software engineer might put it, at the application layers built on top of the quantum OS—then complex numbers are everywhere, in a way that seems impossible to remove. The Schrödinger equation, energy eigenstates, the position/momentum commutation relation, the state space of a spin-1/2 particle in 3-dimensional space: none of these make much sense without complex numbers (though it can be fun to try).
But from a sufficiently Olympian remove, it feels circular to use any of this as a “reason” for why quantum mechanics should’ve involved complex amplitudes in the first place. It’s like, once your OS provides a certain core functionality (in this case, complex numbers), it’d be surprising if the application layer didn’t exploit that functionality to the hilt—especially if we’re talking about fundamental physics, where we’d like to imagine that nothing is wasted or superfluous (hence Rabi’s famous question about the muon: “who ordered that?”).
But why should the quantum OS have provided complex-number functionality at all? Is it possible to answer that question purely in terms of the OS’s internal logic (i.e., abstract quantum information), making minimal reference to how the OS will eventually get used? Maybe not—but if so, then that itself would seem worthwhile to know.
If we stick to abstract quantum information language, then the most “obvious, elementary” argument for why amplitudes should be complex numbers is one that I spelled out in Quantum Computing Since Democritus, as well as my Is quantum mechanics an island in theoryspace? paper. Namely, it seems desirable to be able to implement a “fraction” of any unitary operation U: for example, some V such that V2=U, or V3=U. With complex numbers, this is trivial: we can simply diagonalize U, or use the Hamiltonian picture (i.e., take e-iH/2 where U=e-iH), both of which ultimately depend on the complex numbers being algebraically closed. Over the reals, by contrast, a 2×2 orthogonal matrix like $$ U = \left(\begin{array}[c]{cc}1 & 0\\0 & -1\end{array}\right)$$
has no 2×2 orthogonal square root, as follows immediately from its determinant being -1. If we want a square root of U (or rather, of something that acts like U on a subspace) while sticking to real numbers only, then we need to add another dimension, like so: $$ \left(\begin{array}[c]{ccc}1 & 0 & 0\\0 & -1 & 0\\0 & 0&-1\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}[c]{ccc}1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\\0 & -1 & 0\end{array}\right) ^{2} $$
This is directly related to the fact that there’s no way for a Flatlander to “reflect herself” (i.e., switch her left and right sides while leaving everything else unchanged) by any continuous motion, unless she can lift off the plane and rotate herself through the third dimension. Similarly, for us to reflect ourselves would require rotating through a fourth dimension.
One could reasonably ask: is that it? Aren’t there any “deeper” reasons in quantum information for why amplitudes should be complex numbers?
Indeed, there are certain phenomena in quantum information that, slightly mysteriously, work out more elegantly if amplitudes are complex than if they’re real. (By “mysteriously,” I mean not that these phenomena can’t be 100% verified by explicit calculations, but simply that I don’t know of any deep principle by which the results of those calculations could’ve been predicted in advance.)
One famous example of such a phenomenon is due to Bill Wootters: if you take a uniformly random pure state in d dimensions, and then you measure it in an orthonormal basis, what will the probability distribution (p1,…,pd) over the d possible measurement outcomes look like? The answer, amazingly, is that you’ll get a uniformly random probability distribution: that is, a uniformly random point on the simplex defined by pi≥0 and p1+…+pd=1. This fact, which I’ve used in several papers, is closely related to Archimedes’ Hat-Box Theorem, beloved by friend-of-the-blog Greg Kuperberg. But here’s the kicker: it only works if amplitudes are complex numbers. If amplitudes are real, then the resulting distribution over distributions will be too bunched up near the corners of the probability simplex; if they’re quaternions, it will be too bunched up near the middle.
There’s an even more famous example of such a Goldilocks coincidence—one that’s been elevated, over the past two decades, to exalted titles like “the Axiom of Local Tomography.” Namely: suppose we have an unknown finite-dimensional mixed state ρ, shared by two players Alice and Bob. For example, ρ might be an EPR pair, or a correlated classical bit, or simply two qubits both in the state |0⟩. We imagine that Alice and Bob share many identical copies of ρ, so that they can learn more and more about it by measuring this copy in this basis, that copy in that basis, and so on.
We then ask: can ρ be fully determined from the joint statistics of product measurements—that is, measurements that Alice and Bob can apply separately and locally to their respective subsystems, with no communication between them needed? A good example here would be the set of measurements that arise in a Bell experiment—measurements that, despite being local, certify that Alice and Bob must share an entangled state.
If we asked the analogous question for classical probability distributions, the answer is clearly “yes.” That is, once you’ve specified the individual marginals, and you’ve also specified all the possible correlations among the players, you’ve fixed your distribution; there’s nothing further to specify.
For quantum mixed states, the answer again turns out to be yes, but only because amplitudes are complex numbers! In quantum mechanics over the reals, you could have a 2-qubit state like $$ \rho=\frac{1}{4}\left(\begin{array}[c]{cccc}1 & 0 & 0 & -1\\0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\-1& 0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right) ,$$
which clearly isn’t the maximally mixed state, yet which is indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state by any local measurement that can be specified using real numbers only. (Proof: exercise!)
In quantum mechanics over the quaternions, something even “worse” happens: namely, the tensor product of two Hermitian matrices need not be Hermitian. Alice’s measurement results might be described by the 2×2 quaternionic density matrix $$ \rho_{A}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\begin{array}[c]{cc}1 & -i\\i & 1\end{array}\right), $$
and Bob’s results might be described by the 2×2 quaternionic density matrix $$ \rho_{B}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\begin{array}[c]{cc}1 & -j\\j & 1\end{array}\right), $$
and yet there might not be (and in this case, isn’t) any 4×4 quaternionic density matrix corresponding to ρA⊗ρB, which would explain both results separately.
What’s going on here? Why do the local measurement statistics underdetermine the global quantum state with real amplitudes, and overdetermine it with quaternionic amplitudes, being in one-to-one correspondence with it only when amplitudes are complex?
We can get some insight by looking at the number of independent real parameters needed to specify a d-dimensional Hermitian matrix. Over the complex numbers, the number is exactly d2: we need 1 parameter for each of the d diagonal entries, and 2 (a real part and an imaginary part) for each of the d(d-1)/2 upper off-diagonal entries (the lower off-diagonal entries being determined by the upper ones). Over the real numbers, by contrast, “Hermitian matrices” are just real symmetric matrices, so the number of independent real parameters is only d(d+1)/2. And over the quaternions, the number is d+4[d(d-1)/2] = 2d(d-1).
Now, it turns out that the Goldilocks phenomenon that we saw above—with local measurement statistics determining a unique global quantum state when and only when amplitudes are complex numbers—ultimately boils down to the simple fact that $$ (d_A d_B)^2 = d_A^2 d_B^2, $$
but $$\frac{d_A d_B (d_A d_B + 1)}{2} > \frac{d_A (d_A + 1)}{2} \cdot \frac{d_B (d_B + 1)}{2},$$
and conversely $$ 2 d_A d_B (d_A d_B – 1) < 2 d_A (d_A – 1) \cdot 2 d_B (d_B – 1).$$
In other words, only with complex numbers does the number of real parameters needed to specify a “global” Hermitian operator, exactly match the product of the number of parameters needed to specify an operator on Alice’s subsystem, and the number of parameters needed to specify an operator on Bob’s. With real numbers it overcounts, and with quaternions it undercounts.
A major research goal in quantum foundations, since at least the early 2000s, has been to “derive” the formalism of QM purely from “intuitive-sounding, information-theoretic” postulates—analogous to how, in 1905, some guy whose name I forget derived the otherwise strange-looking Lorentz transformations purely from the assumption that the laws of physics (including a fixed, finite value for the speed of light) take the same form in every inertial frame. There have been some nontrivial successes of this program: most notably, the “axiomatic derivations” of QM due to Lucien Hardy and (more recently) Chiribella et al. Starting from axioms that sound suitably general and nontechnical (if sometimes unmotivated and weird), these derivations perform the impressive magic trick of deriving the full mathematical structure of QM: complex amplitudes, unitary transformations, tensor products, the Born rule, everything.
However, in every such derivation that I know of, some axiom needs to get introduced to capture “local tomography”: i.e., the “principle” that composite systems must be uniquely determined by the statistics of local measurements. And while this principle might sound vague and unobjectionable, to those in the business, it’s obvious what it’s going to be used for the second it’s introduced. Namely, it’s going to be used to rule out quantum mechanics over the real numbers, which would otherwise be a model for the axioms, and thus to “explain” why amplitudes have to be complex.
I confess that I was always dissatisfied with this. For I kept asking myself: would I have ever formulated the “Principle of Local Tomography” in the first place—or if someone else had proposed it, would I have ever accepted it as intuitive or natural—if I didn’t already know that QM over the complex numbers just happens to satisfy it? And I could never honestly answer “yes.” It always felt to me like a textbook example of drawing the target around where the arrow landed—i.e., of handpicking your axioms so that they yield a predetermined conclusion, which is then no more “explained” than it was at the beginning.
Two months ago, something changed for me: namely, I smacked into the “Principle of Local Tomography,” and its reliance on complex numbers, in my own research, when I hadn’t in any sense set out to look for it. This still doesn’t convince me that the principle is any sort of a-priori necessity. But it at least convinces me that it’s, you know, the sort of thing you can smack into when you’re not looking for it.
The aforementioned smacking occurred while I was writing up a small part of a huge paper with Guy Rothblum, about a new connection between so-called “gentle measurements” of quantum states (that is, measurements that don’t damage the states much), and the subfield of classical CS called differential privacy. That connection is a story in itself; here’s our paper and here are some PowerPoint slides.
Anyway, for the paper with Guy, it was of interest to know the following: suppose we have a two-outcome measurement E (let’s say, on n qubits), and suppose it accepts every product state with the same probability p. Must E then accept every entangled state with probability p as well? Or, a closely-related question: suppose we know E’s acceptance probabilities on every product state. Is that enough to determine its acceptance probabilities on all n-qubit states?
I’m embarrassed to admit that I dithered around with these questions, finding complicated proofs for special cases, before I finally stumbled on the one-paragraph, obvious-in-retrospect “Proof from the Book” that slays them in complete generality.
Here it is: if E accepts every product state with probability p, then clearly it accepts every separable mixed state (i.e., every convex combination of product states) with the same probability p. Now, a well-known result of Braunstein et al., from 1998, states that (surprisingly enough) the separable mixed states have nonzero density within the set of all mixed states, in any given finite dimension. Also, the probability that E accepts ρ can be written as f(ρ)=Tr(Eρ), which is linear in the entries of ρ. OK, but a linear function that’s determined on a subset of nonzero density is determined everywhere. And in particular, if f is constant on that subset then it’s constant everywhere, QED.
But what does any of this have to do with why amplitudes are complex numbers? Well, it turns out that the 1998 Braunstein et al. result, which was the linchpin of the above argument, only works in complex QM, not in real QM. We can see its failure in real QM by simply counting parameters, similarly to what we did before. An n-qubit density matrix requires 4n real parameters to specify (OK, 4n-1, if we demand that the trace is 1). Even if we restrict to n-qubit density matrices with real entries only, we still need 2n(2n+1)/2 parameters. By contrast, it’s not hard to show that an n-qubit real separable density matrix can be specified using only 3n real parameters—and indeed, that any such density matrix lies in a 3n-dimensional subspace of the full 2n(2n+1)/2-dimensional space of 2n×2n symmetric matrices. (This is simply the subspace spanned by all possible tensor products of n Pauli I, X, and Z matrices—excluding the Y matrix, which is the one that involves imaginary numbers.)
But it’s not only the Braunstein et al. result that fails in real QM: the fact that I wanted for my paper with Guy fails as well. As a counterexample, consider the 2-qubit measurement that accepts the state ρ with probability Tr(Eρ), where $$ E=\frac{1}{2}\left(\begin{array}[c]{cccc}1 & 0 & 0 & -1\\0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\-1 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right).$$
I invite you to check that this measurement, which we specified using a real matrix, accepts every product state (a|0⟩+b|1⟩)(c|0⟩+d|1⟩), where a,b,c,d are real, with the same probability, namely 1/2—just like the “measurement” that simply returns a coin flip without even looking at the state at all. And yet the measurement can clearly be nontrivial on entangled states: for example, it always rejects $$\frac{\left|00\right\rangle+\left|11\right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}},$$ and it always accepts $$ \frac{\left|00\right\rangle-\left|11\right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.$$
Is it a coincidence that we used exactly the same 4×4 matrix (up to scaling) to produce a counterexample to the real-QM version of Local Tomography, and also to the real-QM version of the property I wanted for the paper with Guy? Is anything ever a coincidence in this sort of discussion?
I claim that, looked at the right way, Local Tomography and the property I wanted are the same property, their truth in complex QM is the same truth, and their falsehood in real QM is the same falsehood. Why? Simply because Tr(Eρ), the probability that the measurement E accepts the mixed state ρ, is a function of two Hermitian matrices E and ρ (both of which can be either “product” or “entangled”), and—crucially—is symmetric under the interchange of E and ρ.
Now it’s time for another confession. We’ve identified an elegant property of quantum mechanics that’s true but only because amplitudes are complex numbers: namely, if you know the probability that your quantum circuit accepts every product state, then you also know the probability that it accepts an arbitrary state. Yet, despite its elegance, this property turns out to be nearly useless for “real-world applications” in quantum information and computing. The reason for the uselessness is that, for the property to kick in, you really do need to know the probabilities on product states almost exactly—meaning (say) to 1/exp(n) accuracy for an n-qubit state.
Once again a simple example illustrates the point. Suppose n is even, and suppose our measurement simply projects the n-qubit state onto a tensor product of n/2 Bell pairs. Clearly, this measurement accepts every n-qubit product state with exponentially small probability, even as it accepts the entangled state
$$\left(\frac{\left|00\right\rangle+\left|11\right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{\otimes n/2}$$
with probability 1. But this implies that noticing the nontriviality on entangled states, would require knowing the acceptance probabilities on product states to exponential accuracy.
In a sense, then, I come back full circle to my original puzzlement: why should Local Tomography, or (alternatively) the-determination-of-a-circuit’s-behavior-on-arbitrary-states-from-its-behavior-on-product-states, have been important principles for Nature’s laws to satisfy? Especially given that, in practice, the exponential accuracy required makes it difficult or impossible to exploit these principles anyway? How could we have known a-priori that these principles would be important—if indeed they are important, and are not just mathematical spandrels?
But, while I remain less than 100% satisfied about “why the complex numbers? why not just the reals?,” there’s one conclusion that my recent circling-back to these questions has made me fully confident about. Namely: quantum mechanics over the quaternions is a flaming garbage fire, which would’ve been rejected at an extremely early stage of God and the angels’ deliberations about how to construct our universe.
In the literature, when the question of “why not quaternionic amplitudes?” is discussed at all, you’ll typically read things about how the parameter-counting doesn’t quite work out (just like it doesn’t for real QM), or how the tensor product of quaternionic Hermitian matrices need not be Hermitian. In this paper by McKague, you’ll read that the CHSH game is winnable with probability 1 in quaternionic QM, while in this paper by Fernandez and Schneeberger, you’ll read that the non-commutativity of the quaternions introduces an order-dependence even for spacelike-separated operations.
But none of that does justice to the enormity of the problem. To put it bluntly: unless something clever is done to fix it, quaternionic QM allows superluminal signaling. This is easy to demonstrate: suppose Alice holds a qubit in the state |1⟩, while Bob holds a qubit in the state |+⟩ (yes, this will work even for unentangled states!) Also, let $$U=\left(\begin{array}[c]{cc}1 & 0\\0 & j\end{array}\right) ,~~~V=\left(\begin{array}[c]{cc}1 & 0\\0& i\end{array}\right).$$
We can calculate that, if Alice applies U to her qubit and then Bob applies V to his qubit, Bob will be left with the state $$ \frac{j \left|0\right\rangle +
k \left|1\right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.$$
By contrast, if Alice decided to apply U only after Bob applied V, Bob would be left with the state
$$ \frac{j \left|0\right\rangle – k \left|1\right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.$$
But Bob can distinguish these two states with certainty, for example by applying the unitary $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}[c]{cc}j & k\\k & j\end{array}\right). $$
Therefore Alice communicated a bit to Bob.
I’m aware that there’s a whole literature on quaternionic QM, including for example a book by Adler. Would anyone who knows that literature be kind enough to enlighten us on how it proposes to escape the signaling problem? Regardless of the answer, though, it seems worth knowing that the “naïve” version of quaternionic QM—i.e., the version that gets invoked in quantum information discussions like the ones I mentioned above—is just immediately blasted to smithereens by the signaling problem, without the need for any subtle considerations like the ones that differentiate real from complex QM.
Update (Dec. 20): In response to this post, Stephen Adler was kind enough to email me with further details about his quaternionic QM proposal, and to allow me to share them here. Briefly, Adler completely agrees that quaternionic QM inevitably leads to superluminal signaling—but in his proposal, the surprising and nontrivial part is that quaternionic QM would reduce to standard, complex QM at large distances. In particular, the strength of a superluminal signal would fall off exponentially with distance, quickly becoming negligible beyond the Planck or grand unification scales. Despite this, Adler says that he eventually abandoned his proposal for quaternionic QM, since he was unable to make specific particle physics ideas work out (but the quaternionic QM proposal then influenced his later work).

People have sometimes asked me: “how do you do it? how do you do your research, write papers, teach classes, mentor grad students, build up the quantum center at UT, travel and give talks every week or two, serve on program committees, raise two rambunctious young kids, and also blog and also participate in the comments and also get depressed about people saying mean things on social media?” The answer is that increasingly I don’t. Something has to give, and this semester, alas, that something has often been blogging.
And that’s why, today, I’m delighted to have a special guest post by my good friend Terry Rudolph. Terry, who happens to be Erwin Schrödinger’s grandson, has done lots of fascinating work over the years in quantum computing and the foundations of quantum mechanics, and previously came up on this blog in the context of the PBR (Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph) Theorem. Today, he’s a cofounder and chief architect at PsiQuantum, a startup in Palo Alto that’s trying to build silicon-photonic quantum computers.
Terry’s guest post is about the prospects for teaching quantum theory at the junior high school level—something he thought about a lot in the context of writing his interesting recent book Q is for Quantum. I should stress that the opinions in this post are Terry’s, and don’t necessarily reflect the official editorial positions of Shtetl-Optimized. Personally, I have taught the basics of quantum information to sharp junior high and high school students, so I certainly know that it’s possible. (By undergrad, it’s not only possible, but maybe should become standard for both physics and CS majors.) But I would also say that, given the current state of junior high and high school education in the US, it would be a huge step up if most students graduated fully understanding what’s a probability, what’s a classical bit, what’s a complex number, and any of dozens of other topics that feed into quantum information—so why not start by teaching the simpler stuff well? And also, if students don’t learn the rules of classical probability first, then how will they be properly shocked when they come to quantum? 🙂
But without further ado, here’s Terry—who’s also graciously agreed to stick around and answer some comments.
Can we/should we teach Quantum Theory in Junior High?
by Terry Rudolph
Should we?
Reasons which suggest the answer is “yes” include:
Economic: We are apparently into a labor market shortage in quantum engineers. We should not, however, need the recent hype around quantum computing to make the economic case – the frontier of many disparate regions of the modern science and technology landscape is quantum. Surely if students do decide to drop out of school at 16 they should at least be equipped to get an entry-level job as a quantum physicist?
Educational: If young peoples’ first exposures to science are counterintuitive and “cutting edge,” it could help excite them into STEM. The strong modern quantum information theoretic connections between quantum physics, computer science and math can help all three subjects constructively generate common interest.
Pseudo-Philosophical: Perhaps our issues with understanding/accepting quantum theory are because we come to it late and have lost the mental plasticity for a “quantum reset” of our brain when we eventually require it late in an undergraduate degree. It may be easier to achieve fluency in the “language of quantum” with early exposure.
Can we?
There are two distinct aspects to this question: Firstly, is it possible at the level of “fitting it in” – training teachers, adjusting curricula and so on? Secondly, can a nontrivial, worthwhile fraction of quantum theory even be taught at all to pre-calculus students?
With regards to the first question, as the child of two schoolteachers I am very aware that an academic advocating for such disruption will not be viewed kindly by all. As I don’t have relevant experience to say anything useful about this aspect, I have to leave it for others to consider.
Let me focus for the remainder of this post on the second aspect, namely whether it is even possible to appropriately simplify the content of the theory. This month it is exactly 20 years since I lectured the first of many varied quantum courses I have taught at multiple universities. For most of that period I would have said it simply wasn’t possible to teach any but the most precocious of high school students nontrivial technical content of quantum theory – despite some brave attempts like Feynman’s use of arrows in QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (a technique that cannot easily get at the mysteries of two-particle quantum theory, which is where the fun really starts). I now believe, however, that it is actually possible.
A pedagogical method covering nontrivial quantum theory using only basic arithmetic
My experience talking about quantum theory to 12-15 year olds has only been in the idealized setting of spending a few hours with them at science fairs, camps and similar. In fact it was on the way to a math camp for very young students, desperately trying to plan something non-trivial to engage them with, that I came up with a pedagogical method which I (and a few colleagues) have found does work.
I eventually wrote the method into a short book Q is for Quantum, but if you don’t want to purchase the book then here is a pdf of Part I,, which takes a student knowing only the rules of basic arithmetic through to learning enough quantum computing they can understand the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm. In fact not only can they do a calculation to see how it works in detail, they can appreciate conceptual nuances often under-appreciated in popular expositions, such as why gate speed doesn’t matter – it’s all about the number of steps, why classical computing also can have exponential growth in “possible states” so interference is critical, why quantum computers do not compute the uncomputable and so on.
Before pointing out a few features of the approach, here are some rules I set myself while writing the book:
- No analogies, no jargon – if it can’t be explained quantitatively then leave it out.
- No math more than basic arithmetic and distribution across brackets.
- Keep clear the distinction between mathematical objects and the observed physical events they are describing.
- Be interpretationally neutral.
- No soap opera: Motivate by intriguing with science, not by regurgitating quasi-mythological stories about the founders of the theory.
- No using the word “quantum” in the main text! This was partly to amuse myself, but I also thought if I was succeeding in the other points then I should be able to avoid a word almost synonymous with “hard and mysterious.”
One of the main issues to confront is how to represent and explain superposition. It is typical in popular expositions to draw analogies between a superposition of, say, a cat which is dead and a cat which is alive by saying it is dead “and” alive. But if superposition was equivalent to logical “and”, or, for that matter, logical “or”, then quantum computing wouldn’t be interesting, and in this and other ways the analogy is ultimately misleading. The approach I use is closer to the latter – an unordered list of possible states for a system (which is most like an “or”) can be used to represent a superposition. Using a list has some advantages – it is natural to apply a transformation to all elements of a list, for instance doubling the list of ingredients in a recipe. More critically, given two independent lists of possibilities the new joint list of combined possibilities is a natural concept. This makes teaching the equivalent of the Kronecker (tensor) product for multiple systems easy, something often a bit tricky even for undergrads to become comfortable with.
Conceptually the weirdest part of the whole construction, particularly for someone biased by the standard formalism, is that I use a standard mathematical object (a negative or minus sign) applied to a diagram of a physical object (a black or white ball). Moreover, positive and negative balls in a diagram can cancel out (interfere). This greatly simplifies the exposition, by removing a whole level of abstraction in the standard theory (we do not need to use a vector containing entries whose specific ordering must be remembered in order to equate them to the physical objects). While it initially seemed odd to me personally to do this, I have yet to have any young person think of it as any more weird than using the negative sign on a number. And if it is always kept clear that drawing and manipulating the whole diagram is an abstract thing we do, which may or may not have any correspondence to what is “really going on” in the physical setups we are describing, then there really is no difference.
There are some subtleties about the whole approach – while the formalism is universal for quantum computing, it can only make use of unitary evolution which is proportional to a matrix with integer entries. Thus the Hadamard gate (PETE box) is ok, the Controlled-NOT and Toffoli likewise, but a seemingly innocuous gate like the controlled-Hadamard is not capable of being incorporated (without adding a whole bunch of unintuitive and unjustified rules). The fact the approach covers a universal gate set means some amazing things can be explained in this simple diagrammatic language. For example, the recent paper Quantum theory cannot consistently describe the use of itself, which led to considerable discussion on this blog, can be fully reproduced. That is, a high school student can in principle understand the technical details of a contemporary argument between professional physicists. I find this amazing.
Based on communication with readers I have come to realize the people at most risk of being confused by the book are actually those already with a little knowledge – someone who has done a year or two’s worth of undergraduate quantum courses, or someone who has taken things they read in pop-sci books too literally. Initially, as I was developing the method, I thought it would be easy to keep “touching base” with the standard vector space formalism. But in fact it becomes very messy to do so (and irrelevant for someone learning quantum theory for the first time). In the end I dropped that goal, but now realize I need to develop some supplementary notes to help someone in that situation.
Q is for Quantum is certainly not designed to be used as a classroom text – if nothing else my particular style and choice of topics will not be to others’ tastes, and I haven’t included all the many, many simple examples and exercises I have students doing along with me in class when I actually teach this stuff.

I’ve gotten a bunch of emails lately of the form “why haven’t you ever blogged about such-and-such?,” when it turned out that I damn well did blog about it; it was just somewhere down in a multi-item post.
1. Like many of you, I watched the US midterm election results with (mostly…) disappointment and dismay. I think that history will judge us harshly for not totally and unequivocally rebuking everything Trump stands for and every politician associated with him. But that’s not what I wanted to blog about today.
2. There was a breakthrough in communication complexity by Arkadev Chattopadhyay, Nikhil Mande, and Suhail Sherif: the first exponential separation between randomized communication complexity and log approximate rank for a total Boolean function f. This falsifies the longstanding conjecture that these measures are polynomially related (though it doesn’t resolve the original log rank conjecture). For those of you keeping score at home, the quantum communication complexity of f is sandwiched in between randomized CC and log approximate rank. So, at least one of the following must now be true: either randomized CC is exponentially separated from quantum CC, or else quantum CC is exponentially separated from log approximate rank. My money’s on the latter.
3. Ewin Tang, who achieved fame with a quantum-inspired classical algorithm for recommendation systems (which I blogged about in July), is now back with quantum-inspired classical algorithms for principal component analysis and supervised clustering. Well, with the announcements of such algorithms; details of the analysis are to come later.
4. A bunch of people asked me about the paper by Sergey Bravyi, David Gosset, and Robert Koenig, Quantum advantage with shallow circuits. tl;dr: it’s great! And it was deservedly a highlight of the QIP conference back in January! That’s why it confused me when everyone started asking about it a couple weeks ago. The resolution is that the paper was just recently published in Science magazine, which led to popular coverage like this, which in turn led to people asking me whether this result unconditionally proves P≠BQP (that is, quantum computers can solve more problems in polynomial time than classical computers), and if not why not. The answer is no: the paper proves an unconditional separation, but one that’s a long long way from P≠BQP, or anything else that would entail solving the central open problems of complexity theory like P vs. PSPACE. Basically, it shows there are problems solvable in constant time with a quantum computer that aren’t solvable in constant time classically, for suitable meanings of “problem” (namely, a relation problem) and “in constant time” (namely, NC0 circuits, in which each output bit depends on only a constant number of input bits). I understand that a stronger separation has since been achieved, between quantum NC0 and classical AC0, in work that’s not yet on the arXiv. The problems in question, however, are all easy to solve in P, or even in classical logarithmic time, given a polynomial number of parallel processors.
5. A bunch of people also asked me about the paper by Xun Gao and Luming Duan, Efficient classical simulation of noisy quantum computation. This paper tries to formalize something that many of us have suspected/feared for years, namely that random quantum circuits (the whole thing is specific to random circuits) can tolerate only a tiny amount of noise and decoherence before they become efficiently simulable classically. If true, this has obvious implications for the sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments that Google and others are planning for the next few years: namely, that all the engineering effort they’ve already been investing anyway to push down the noise rate, will actually be necessary! However, correspondence with the authors revealed that there’s a significant gap in the analysis as it currently stands: namely, the current proof applies only to closed quantum systems, which would (for example) rule out all the techniques that people eventually hope to use to achieve quantum fault-tolerance—all of which are based on constantly measuring subsets of the qubits, doing essentially error-free classical computation on the measurement outcomes, throwing away noisy qubits, and pumping in fresh qubits. Xun and Duan say that they’re currently working on an extension to open systems; in my personal view, such an extension seems essential for this interesting result to have the informal interpretation that the authors want.
6. My friend Bram Cohen asked me to announce that his company, Chia, has launched a competition for best implementation of its Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs), with real money rewards. You can find the details at this Github page.
7. The second Q2B (“Quantum 2 Business”) conference, organized by QC Ware Corp., will be held this coming December 10-12, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. There will be two keynote addresses, one by John Preskill and the other by me. I hope I’ll get a chance to meet some of you there!
8. Longtime colleague and friend-of-the-blog Ashwin Nayak asked me to announce that the 2019 Conference on Computational Complexity, to be held July 18-20 in exciting New Brunswick, NJ, is now accepting submissions. I hope to be there!
9. OK, what the hell: the 21st annual, and nearly impossible to capitalize correctly, SQuInT (Southwest Quantum Information and Technology) workshop will be held February 2019 in Albuquerque, NM. UT Austin is now a node of the SQuInT network, and I’ll hopefully be attending along with a posse of students and postdocs. The deadline for abstract submission is coming up soon: Monday November 12!
10. I went to morning Shabbat services in Austin this past weekend, exactly one week after the tragedy in Pittsburgh. There was massively increased security, with armed guards interrogating us, Israeli-style, about why we had no membership sticker on our car, whether we knew the name of the rabbi, etc. Attendance was maybe a factor of three higher than usual. About thirty priests, ministers, and Christian seminary students, and one Muslim, came up to the bima to say a prayer of solidarity with Jews. The mayor of Austin, Steve Adler, was also on hand to give a speech. Then the rabbi read a letter to the synagogue by Sen. Ted Cruz denouncing antisemitism (well, parts of it; he said the letter was really long). There were murmurs of disapproval from the crowd when Cruz’s name was mentioned, but then everyone quieted down and listened. The thing is, the US and large parts of the world are now so far outside the norms of liberal democracy, in territory so terrifyingly uncharted since the end of World War II, that shooting up synagogues is bad is actually something that it’s better than not for powerful people to affirm explicitly. Anyway, while I’m neither a believer nor much of a synagogue-goer, I found the show of unity moving.",7030,"['9c1d0983d2707a287e143ea1eaeb6ce05a63953b698d93c7c965fdae7ce40c85', '642734f0d66e31b289f57f54b1068c37d0074684897a621ba1bff3070f9d8956', 'a5bb01e7303e4f9856a009e9000b7ec02623c35f9f92f777aeb357994acada93', '637befe115b253fb8e1f6ca2f5be5525cd43339ee6e7755b3a30ad47a4fd5d22', '519182c579e27706e47ca67b63d49a82960f2aca8946790d0b97219f87475167', 'e57ceb9a896bbab4c4e82631c45cd5576512415d525c86139199be1f71c67a94', 'fd7ff4aca6ac97f80b265d36577f65a2e3e1cda3cd068b1c6a5a2ee7fd77f6f8', '5c597f82156840e293c5e70d6726ba3f94b1d89229ac9018684d8040003ca837', '3eaf1bb4ef098c8cc73a3e0defe109a424d0143f33bcbb1bac1a7d7c6e7e1835', '7384cb60918c836ecfbea8ff3adde249c2956a6848cf589d1502df2b374dd049', '70953d19dd0eae6e5aa60497c8b448c9ab3a5f12269ccf8cf9bf5c98737fbd51', 'be1676fc5a957b9071172f35e628142f5a20418b21ea257fcbb8c7b84b308db5', 'cb6604750cdd20a06fb15de4b645e7198692470fa8e7416cd9a6d45fd8b65c93', 'e54c42bdf6892a4a26434a409ac54b9bcb2d51393a779dcbc99bf9e448ba0078', '026f37d95e08b7c18c77f92a5a50d6518e2512ef3ea06dbb8dd8ece3a80218aa', '608e6962d8d1e9274409be2325dacaa63d84105e21c4373e404cd44306a2f4da', 'f0ebe0ad4b485e8c952cd975cc4b88f9177ca69198bb5818b8278436df106b0e', '16201fb35a493779a8f0c03d255cfee6e7edcf59a94db1fccecf9253f263a6fd', '516069334369475d202d40d126d59d7b4c254958530ea3dac9dcf9dc6aa8f69e', '8ed4d41557461b4619bca1b390f6a3121cf5c53d789f7905c0065cb0c1a97749', '4d56e5ee2bd60627ae4b6c53d3b7377f37251e09c805cd9cb03f08addabe4bd5', 'e67e1d95933b798e9e5310f555b8d59119bbc87aeb4f39f74acffa12abe85922', '07df9599a44c2f6afa42af5749cf9587d26ef70b7de7cc52a5ccd016ca8a36d0', '8b5b419314717d46d412f31038f9e691e696d8fa9b4d1ef2222de3a509634cef', '8b74de71069ee101bacf2c878cd6b1b7c484da7391dc8dd7c3bfccd475d20176', '42035e41bc9587bef909d66e2915dc66225362bc5d5e374c92f35236a1ee7b27', '54f5879ee7847be80f83931c766832afbd96022e72c79d9a0b1fdcc6fa4e858e', 'b51eb8d1ab502f0b9604ceb4b38391a7d519af3704268fd917deb86c146ba40b', 'afc5d4b7d4cbf78a0a86eef3b61a1213132b8bac1559d32618ca0b1c9f01c6f4', '3eb341d6d56802987e873952ff11d3e3df840a5cc179031535e3693c412361cf', '7c641eb91babd7d395b83b84d076699278cfc4334d3942079107709756e4612b', '724620bb784dc6c9be63e07b92d4acdee120d99eee59f565727250a6d42aa998', '3df76b84a466b32a75d934d2c09433c87191a36798e1d61764bcbf9c4946dcfd', '9724c97ee6f05f0fa71508ec1c8243336177189139b2f3ad41f84246b4504f8b', '4f26d48bbc1574135af183362f4b5fb48c9ed3bdd9a0280fdbd5c30a8f7c1dd6', '79fcf0e196ec9ce4b9f82e9d3705be859a16a7912ec0a0be2f3db49a68062acd', '5e8609d2c927f391b882d0a34d326b861f1103df5516ab90882d70d28b3fce75', '92bf88e142952dd8f584700e6e18ed5364fee69a9b19d52e25890242e5ae9865', '930d019f1c7bbb297fc03a1c0268a25797f4a9a4c4f076ccec4ca9a93faac1f1', 'bf8a04b96d2f737f8a539e5e2a956a4663b294e82983dbc48f12429c07dbc366', '3af85bf2811c1624e4198e317df8ec7ad8497c87d77f0e0dde3d7a1a949624ab', 'df2cfd9bd407313254fb5e9b98f7012e15cb04b28e13b66b1e2995bfa9571e2e', 'f4f071abf70f1187eb93adb67344bdec64d804e5e40d64928098fdc19803b76b', '929e97a1ad4cbfd9b2d99c098a0b5755edfff630967eb074721048022655771e', '9d132879ed50bd929bc6c0413a0e21661ccf2675e9421220e1bddfe62c2c90b6', 'e17c4500d5f901a8568cc027afc1229f9b1a386a9cf5b120b54c6e91d2d32679', '298846ad3aa25a4358e76ed1c002ccf2c3e4291d26bb8346bad0e2a7fcc28959', '02ef1b5a21771083d43976683d3dda34e7e37f5f0dd6a905ef9b6f24441970ea', '55c7a17b162e7d081402c61c20b1be196bca6c4950590c227ac6935cb08de55b', '90e13fdae89270c2dcb97333e267458d6db8f014d6283e0dde5f77de247e76b5', '5d4efee9a9aad88da52f83bd63cfb14bed24200cbb80418d4575d664284f125a', 'a7a25fdf77e91d88622ff60925ef4dc9c8062f320f79e783537bfdd35294a212']"
101,3975,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3975,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2018-09-25,Scott Aaronson,It’s hard to think when someone Hadamards your brain,"“Unperformed measurements have no results.” —Asher Peres
With two looming paper deadlines, two rambunctious kids, an undergrad class, program committee work, faculty recruiting, and an imminent trip to Capitol Hill to answer congressional staffers’ questions about quantum computing (and for good measure, to give talks at UMD and Johns Hopkins), the only sensible thing to do is to spend my time writing a blog post.
So: a bunch of people asked for my reaction to the new Nature Communications paper by Daniela Frauchiger and Renato Renner, provocatively titled “Quantum theory cannot consistently describe the use of itself.” Here’s the abstract:
Quantum theory provides an extremely accurate description of fundamental processes in physics. It thus seems likely that the theory is applicable beyond the, mostly microscopic, domain in which it has been tested experimentally. Here, we propose a Gedankenexperiment to investigate the question whether quantum theory can, in principle, have universal validity. The idea is that, if the answer was yes, it must be possible to employ quantum theory to model complex systems that include agents who are themselves using quantum theory. Analysing the experiment under this presumption, we find that one agent, upon observing a particular measurement outcome, must conclude that another agent has predicted the opposite outcome with certainty. The agents’ conclusions, although all derived within quantum theory, are thus inconsistent. This indicates that quantum theory cannot be extrapolated to complex systems, at least not in a straightforward manner.
I first encountered Frauchiger and Renner’s argument back in July, when Renner (who I’ve known for years, and who has many beautiful results in quantum information) presented it at a summer school in Boulder, CO where I was also lecturing. I was sufficiently interested (or annoyed?) that I pulled an all-nighter working through the argument, then discussed it at lunch with Renner as well as John Preskill. I enjoyed figuring out exactly where I get off Frauchiger and Renner’s train—since I do get off their train. While I found their paper thought-provoking, I reject the contention that there’s any new problem with QM’s logical consistency: for reasons I’ll explain, I think there’s only the same quantum weirdness that (to put it mildly) we’ve known about for quite some time.
In more detail, the paper makes a big deal about how the new argument rests on just three assumptions (briefly, QM works, measurements have definite outcomes, and the “transitivity of knowledge”); and how if you reject the argument, then you must reject at least one of the three assumptions; and how different interpretations (Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, Bohmian mechanics, etc.) make different choices about what to reject.
But I reject an assumption that Frauchiger and Renner never formalize. That assumption is, basically: “it makes sense to chain together statements that involve superposed agents measuring each other’s brains in different incompatible bases, as if the statements still referred to a world where these measurements weren’t being done.” I say: in QM, even statements that look “certain” in isolation might really mean something like “if measurement X is performed, then Y will certainly be a property of the outcome.” The trouble arises when we have multiple such statements, involving different measurements X1, X2, …, and (let’s say) performing X1 destroys the original situation in which we were talking about performing X2.
But I’m getting ahead of myself. The first thing to understand about Frauchiger and Renner’s argument is that, as they acknowledge, it’s not entirely new. As Preskill helped me realize, the argument can be understood as simply the “Wigner’s-friendification” of Hardy’s Paradox. In other words, the new paradox is exactly what you get if you take Hardy’s paradox from 1992, and promote its entangled qubits to the status of conscious observers who are in superpositions over thinking different thoughts. Having talked to Renner about it, I don’t think he fully endorses the preceding statement. But since I fully endorse it, let me explain the two ingredients that I think are getting combined here—starting with Hardy’s paradox, which I confess I didn’t know (despite knowing Lucien Hardy himself!) before the Frauchiger-Renner paper forced me to learn it.
Hardy’s paradox involves the two-qubit entangled state
$$\left|\psi\right\rangle = \frac{\left|00\right\rangle + \left|01\right\rangle + \left|10\right\rangle}{\sqrt{3}}.$$
And it involves two agents, Alice and Bob, who measure the left and right qubits respectively, both in the {|+〉,|-〉} basis. Using the Born rule, we can straightforwardly calculate the probability that Alice and Bob both see the outcome |-〉 as 1/12.
So what’s the paradox? Well, let me now “prove” to you that Alice and Bob can never both get |-〉. Looking at |ψ〉, we see that conditioned on Alice’s qubit being in the state |0〉, Bob’s qubit is in the state |+〉, so Bob can never see |-〉. And conversely, conditioned on Bob’s qubit being in the state |0〉, Alice’s qubit is in the state |+〉, so Alice can never see |-〉. OK, but since |ψ〉 has no |11〉 component, at least one of the two qubits must be in the state |0〉, so therefore at least one of Alice and Bob must see |+〉!
When it’s spelled out so plainly, the error is apparent. Namely, what do we even mean by a phrase like “conditioned on Bob’s qubit being in the state |0〉,” unless Bob actually measured his qubit in the {|0〉,|1〉} basis? But if Bob measured his qubit in the {|0〉,|1〉} basis, then we’d be talking about a different, counterfactual experiment. In the actual experiment, Bob measures his qubit only in the {|+〉,|-〉} basis, and Alice does likewise. As Asher Peres put it, “unperformed measurements have no results.”
Anyway, as I said, if you strip away the words and look only at the actual setup, it seems to me that Frauchiger and Renner’s contribution is basically to combine Hardy’s paradox with the earlier Wigner’s friend paradox. They thereby create something that doesn’t involve counterfactuals quite as obviously as Hardy’s paradox does, and so requires a new discussion.
But to back up: what is Wigner’s friend? Well, it’s basically just Schrödinger’s cat, except that now it’s no longer a cat being maintained in coherent superposition but a person, and we’re emphatic in demanding that this person be treated as a quantum-mechanical observer. Thus, suppose Wigner entangles his friend with a qubit, like so:
$$ \left|\psi\right\rangle = \frac{\left|0\right\rangle \left|FriendSeeing0\right\rangle + \left|1\right\rangle \left|FriendSeeing1\right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}. $$
From the friend’s perspective, the qubit has been measured and has collapsed to either |0〉 or |1〉. From Wigner’s perspective, no such thing has happened—there’s only been unitary evolution—and in principle, Wigner could even confirm that by measuring |ψ〉 in a basis that included |ψ〉 as one of the basis vectors. But how can they both be right?
Many-Worlders will yawn at this question, since for them, of course “the collapse of the wavefunction” is just an illusion created by the branching worlds, and with sufficiently advanced technology, one observer might experience the illusion even while a nearby observer doesn’t. Ironically, the neo-Copenhagenists / Quantum Bayesians / whatever they now call themselves, though they consider themselves diametrically opposed to the Many-Worlders (and vice versa), will also yawn at the question, since their whole philosophy is about how physics is observer-relative and it’s sinful even to think about an objective, God-given “quantum state of the universe.” If, on the other hand, you believed both that
- collapse is an objective physical event, and
- human mental states can be superposed just like anything else in the physical universe,
then Wigner’s thought experiment probably should rock your world.
OK, but how do we Wigner’s-friendify Hardy’s paradox? Simple: in the state
$$\left|\psi\right\rangle = \frac{\left|00\right\rangle + \left|01\right\rangle + \left|10\right\rangle}{\sqrt{3}},$$
we “promote” Alice’s and Bob’s entangled qubits to two conscious observers, call them Charlie and Diane respectively, who can think two different thoughts that we represent by the states |0〉 and |1〉. Using far-future technology, Charlie and Diane have been not merely placed into coherent superpositions over mental states but also entangled with each other.
Then, as before, Alice will measure Charlie’s brain in the {|+〉,|-〉} basis, and Bob will measure Diane’s brain in the {|+〉,|-〉} basis. Since the whole setup is mathematically identical to that of Hardy’s paradox, the probability that Alice and Bob both get the outcome |-〉 is again 1/12.
Ah, but now we can reason as follows:
- Whenever Alice gets the outcome |-〉, she knows that Diane must be in the |1〉 state (since, if Diane were in the |0〉 state, then Alice would’ve certainly seen |+〉).
- Whenever Diane is in the |1〉 state, she knows that Charlie must be in the |0〉 state (since there’s no |11〉 component).
- Whenever Charlie is in the |0〉 state, she knows that Diane is in the |+〉 state, and hence Bob can’t possibly see the outcome |-〉 when he measures Diane’s brain in the {|+〉,|-〉} basis.
So to summarize, Alice knows that Diane knows that Charlie knows that Bob can’t possibly see the outcome |-〉. By the “transitivity of knowledge,” this implies that Alice herself knows that Bob can’t possibly see |-〉. And yet, as we pointed out before, quantum mechanics predicts that Bob can see |-〉, even when Alice has also seen |-〉. And Alice and Bob could even do the experiment, and compare notes, and see that their “certain knowledge” was false. Ergo, “quantum theory can’t consistently describe its own use”!
You might wonder: compared to Hardy’s original paradox, what have we gained by waving a magic wand over our two entangled qubits, and calling them “conscious observers”? Frauchiger and Renner’s central claim is that, by this gambit, they’ve gotten rid of the illegal counterfactual reasoning that we needed to reach a contradiction in our analysis of Hardy’s paradox. After all, they say, none of the steps in their argument involve any measurements that aren’t actually performed! But clearly, even if no one literally measures Charlie in the {|0〉,|1〉} basis, he’s still there, thinking either the thought corresponding to |0〉 or the thought corresponding to |1〉. And likewise Diane. Just as much as Alice and Bob, Charlie and Diane both exist even if no one measures them, and they can reason about what they know and what they know that others know. So then we’re free to chain together the “certainties” of Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diane in order to produce our contradiction.
As I already indicated, I reject this line of reasoning. Specifically, I get off the train at what I called step 3 above. Why? Because the inference from Charlie being in the |0〉 state to Bob seeing the outcome |+〉 holds for the original state |ψ〉, but in my view it ceases to hold once we know that Alice is going to measure Charlie in the {|+〉,|-〉} basis, which would involve a drastic unitary transformation (specifically, a “Hadamard”) on the quantum state of Charlie’s brain. I.e., I don’t accept that we can take knowledge inferences that would hold in a hypothetical world where |ψ〉 remained unmeasured, with a particular “branching structure” (as a Many-Worlder might put it), and extend them to the situation where Alice performs a rather violent measurement on |ψ〉 that changes the branching structure by scrambling Charlie’s brain.
In quantum mechanics, measure or measure not: there is no if you hadn’t measured.
Unrelated Announcement: My awesome former PhD student Michael Forbes, who’s now on the faculty at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, asked me to advertise that the UIUC CS department is hiring this year in all areas, emphatically including quantum computing. And, well, I guess my desire to do Michael a solid outweighed my fear of being tried for treason by my own department’s recruiting committee…

This is my annual post where I tell you about opportunities available at UT Austin, which has long been a safe space for CS research, and which we hope will rapidly become (or return to its historical role as…) a safe space for quantum computing and information.
If you’re interested in faculty positions in computer science at UT, I have some great news: we plan to do a lot of hiring this year! Because of the sheer volume of interviews we’ll be doing, we’d like to start our recruiting season already in the fall. So we’re extending an unusual invitation: if you already have your materials ready, we encourage you to apply for faculty positions right now. If you’re chosen for an interview, we could schedule it for the next few months.
We’ll be looking for great candidates across all parts of CS, but one particular interest is hiring another quantum computing theorist in CS (i.e., besides me), most likely a junior person. While not everyone who reads this blog is a plausible candidate, and not every plausible candidate reads this blog, the intersection is surely non-negligible! So again: we encourage you to apply right now, so we can start scheduling interviews already.
I’m also on the lookout for postdocs, mainly in theoretical quantum computing and information. (I, and others in the theory group, are also collectively interested in postdocs in classical computational complexity.) If you’re interested in doing a postdoc with me starting in Fall 2019, the procedure, like in previous years, is this:
- Email me introducing yourself (if I don’t already know you), and include your CV and up to three representative papers. Do this even if you already emailed me before.
- Arrange for two recommendation letters to be emailed to me.
We’ll set a deadline for this of December 15.
Finally, if you’re interested in pursuing a PhD in CS at UT, please apply here! The deadline, again, is December 15. Just like every year, I’m on the lookout for superb, complexity-loving, quantum- or quantum-curious, lower-bound-hungry students of every background, and if you specify that you want to work with me, I’ll be sure to see your application. Emailing me won’t help: everything is done through the application process.
As we like to say down here in Texas, hook ’em Hadamards! (Well OK, no, we don’t especially like to say that. It’s just a slogan that I found amusing a few years ago.)",2412,"['be0e89d5d642db6c97ade0c9d2aee9b19fff79044c6a4770046ca5ac1052b878', 'aac51d5ac0596720074560aa487d5f1a4307dc214a76782ea34a38de1ccae801', '0775e4ae38db851e31a7be01010be8e671736e9ebd778baa47209917fe0ffab8', '9d4b3f70489ac25bfecdf97817c3e766adcc5c80a51d1bd0dbde2676ed0939e7', 'b5b78ff3008e8b5e49951387c783812f5559eacdc5c7fde28c8b3682516c01ae']"

On Thursday, I had the incredible honor of accepting the 2018 Tomassoni-Chisesi Prize in Physics at Università “La Sapienza” in Rome—“incredible” mostly because I’m of course not a physicist. (I kept worrying they’d revoke the award when they realized I could barely solve the wave equation.) This is not the first time quantum information was recognized; the prize has previously gone to Serge Haroche and Alain Aspect. This year, for the first time, there was both an under-40 and an over-40 award; the latter went to Philip Kim, a quantum materials researcher at Harvard who I had the privilege to meet on this trip (he’s the taller one below).
I’m unbelievably grateful, not only to the committee, and its chair Giorgio Parisi (whose seminal work on phase transitions and satisfiability I’d long known, but who I met for the first time on this trip), but to Fabio Sciarrino, Paolo Mataloni, Fernanda Lupinacci, and everyone else who graciously hosted me and helped make my hastily-planned visit to Europe a success.
The department I visited has a storied history: here are the notes that Enrico Fermi left, documenting what he covered each day in his physics class in 1938. The reason the last squares are blank is that, when Fermi and his Jewish wife left for Stockholm on the occasion of Fermi’s Nobel Prize, they continued directly to the US rather than return to an Italy that had just passed the racial laws.
On my way to Rome, I also gave two talks at a “quantum computing hackathon” in Zurich, called QuID (Quantum Information for Developers). Thanks so much to Lidia del Rio for arranging that visit, which was fantastic as well.
To accept the Tomassoni-Chisesi prize, I had to give a 40-minute talk summarizing all my research from 2000 to the present—the hardest part being that I had to do it while wearing a suit, and sweating at least half my body weight. (I also had a cold and a hacking cough.) I think there will eventually be video of my and Prof. Kim’s talks, but it’s not yet available. In the meantime, for those who are interested, here are my PowerPoint slides, and here’s the title and abstract:
Three Questions About Quantum Computing
Scott Aaronson (University of Texas at Austin)
I’ll discuss some of my work in quantum computing over the past 18 years, organizing it in terms of three questions. First, how can we demonstrate, using near-future hardware, that quantum computers can get any genuine speedups at all over classical computers (ideally useful speedups)? Second, what sorts of problems would be hard even for quantum computers, and can we turn the intractability of those problems to our advantage? Third, are there physically reasonable models of computation even more powerful than quantum computing, or does quantum computing represent an ultimate limit?
If you’re a regular reader here, most of the content will be stuff you’ve seen before, with the exception of a story or two like the following:
Last night I was talking to my mom about my grandfather, who as it happens came through Rome 73 years ago, as an engineer with the US Army. Disabling landmines was, ironically, one of the safer ways to be a Jew in Europe at that time. If you’d told him then that, three-quarters of a century later, his grandson would be back here in Rome to accept an award for research in quantum computational complexity … well, I’m sure he’d have any number of questions about it. But one thing I clearly remember is that my grandfather was always full of effusive praise for the warmth of the people he met in Italy—how, for example, Italian farmers would share food with the hungry and inadequately-provisioned Allied soldiers, despite supposedly being on the opposing side. Today, every time I’m in Italy for a conference or a talk, I get to experience that warmth myself, and certainly the food part.
(Awww! But I meant it. Italians are super-warm.)
There’s a view that scientists should just pursue the truth and be serenely unaffected by prizes, recognition, and other baubles. I think that view has a great deal to be said for it. But thinking it over recently, I struck the following mental bargain: if I’m going to get depressed on a semi-regular basis by people attacking me online—and experience shows that I will—well then, I also get to enjoy whatever’s the opposite of that with a clear conscience. It’s not arrogance or self-importance; it’s just trying to balance things out a bit!
So again, thanks so much—to the physics department of La Sapienza, but also to my family, friends, mentors, readers, colleagues at UT Austin and around the world, and everyone else who helps make possible whatever it is that I do.",4790,"['a929c9eb13b9d4c2017e519483554b4baa629a97e0f61d2d1fb5e0a436fa6642', 'af2b4f0238529155e5ac47a546ff2e7c5354e75aff0c71759561271f93517f54', '33b9ea02b889a1420303a9a4188796fe33c577f6f642c72d53cfd0c30764a286', 'bcc3a1fb5f13b210023c7d8ea1ea1b34763c0aed97772d2b1cb9cbe5d7c1ce49', '6e5ae83d92719218584fad804423aaef6b00986b2c2da9f632aeeccfa4af626b', 'c45654247e25dd01f2319caea526173992ba73b05f2c528044c0697c2a168254', '17d7f4b0b94b7caa3e36d8000ad9a3fb585d6ed2a52d7479451ba5819544a2ff', 'a37a9f90d3965bbf4abba8c77ead61dd94526ca2294f21009f32cecce91ed07e', 'a37a9f90d3965bbf4abba8c77ead61dd94526ca2294f21009f32cecce91ed07e', '67a48b164cb90bcb1858707763f55ecaa67304c9ca1f202d8fef147cd74fb003', '417a4e0b40ddc02c543cb7f7ebe102f0b29099ba2ce4d9a9f7eeb192fca38a43', '9c64781e7262ecc2c04a30f8e3f67214a96b02500aae5f58ffd005b8ec3e78a3', '91cd8687d127a511a7292634fa31e17b0538c876225b0347f59bec848b1ff7f0']"
104,3943,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3943,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2018-08-26,Scott Aaronson,Lecture notes! Intro to Quantum Information Science,"Someone recently wrote that my blog is “too high on nerd whining content and too low on actual compsci content to be worth checking too regularly.” While that’s surely one of the mildest criticisms I’ve ever received, I hope that today’s post will help to even things out.
In Spring 2017, I taught a new undergraduate course at UT Austin, entitled Introduction to Quantum Information Science. There were about 60 students, mostly CS but also with strong representation from physics, math, and electrical engineering. One student, Ewin Tang, made a previous appearance on this blog. But today belongs to another student, Paulo Alves, who took it upon himself to make detailed notes of all of my lectures. Using Paulo’s notes as a starting point, and after a full year of procrastination and delays, I’m now happy to release the full lecture notes for the course. Among other things, I’ll be using these notes when I teach the course a second time, starting … holy smokes … this Wednesday.
I don’t pretend that these notes break any new ground. Even if we restrict to undergrad courses only (which rules out, e.g., Preskill’s legendary notes), there are already other great quantum information lecture notes available on the web, such as these from Berkeley (based on a course taught by, among others, my former adviser Umesh Vazirani and committee member Birgitta Whaley), and these from John Watrous in Waterloo. There are also dozens of books—including Mermin’s, which we used in this course. The only difference with these notes is that … well, they cover exactly the topics I’d cover, in exactly the order I’d cover them, and with exactly the stupid jokes and stories I’d tell in a given situation. So if you like my lecturing style, you’ll probably like these, and if not, not (but given that you’re here, there’s hopefully some bias toward the former).
The only prerequisite for these notes is some minimal previous exposure to linear algebra and algorithms. If you read them all, you might not be ready yet to do research in quantum information—that’s what a grad course is for—but I feel good that you’ll have an honest understanding of what quantum information is all about and where it currently stands. (In fact, where it already stood by the late 1990s and early 2000s, but with many comments about the theoretical and experimental progress that’s been made since then.)
Also, if you’re one of the people who read Quantum Computing Since Democritus and who was disappointed by the lack of basic quantum algorithms in that book—a function of the book’s origins, as notes of lectures given to graduate students who already knew basic quantum algorithms—then consider these new notes my restitution. If nothing else, no one can complain about a dearth of basic quantum algorithms here.
I welcome comments, bugfixes, etc. Thanks so much, not only to Paulo for transcribing the lectures (and making the figures!), but also to Patrick Rall and Corey Ostrove for TA’ing the course, to Tom Wong and Supartha Podder for giving guest lectures, and of course, to all the students for making the course what it was.

Notes and Updates (Aug. 27)
Here’s a 184-page combined file. Thanks so much to Robert Rand, Oscar Cunningham, Petter S, and Noon van der Silk for their help with this.
If it wasn’t explicit: these notes are copyright Scott Aaronson 2018, free for personal or academic use, but not for modification or sale.
I’ve freely moved material between lectures so that it wasn’t arbitrarily cut across lecture boundaries. This is one of the reasons why some lectures are much longer than others.
I apologize that some of the displayed equations are ugly. This is because we never found an elegant way to edit equations in Google Docs.
If you finish these notes and are still hankering for more, try my Quantum Complexity Theory or Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science lecture notes, or my Barbados lecture notes.

105,3896,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3896,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2018-07-24,Scott Aaronson,Summer recapitulates life,"Last week, I was back at the IAS in Princeton, to speak at a wonderful PITP summer school entitled “From Qubits to Spacetime,” co-organized by Juan Maldacena and Edward Witten. This week, I’ll be back in Waterloo, to visit old and new friends at the Perimeter Institute and Institute for Quantum Computing and give a couple talks. Then, over the weekend, I’ll be back in Boston to see old friends, colleagues, and students. After some other miscellaneous travel, I’ll then return to Austin in late August when the semester begins. The particular sequence IAS → Waterloo → Boston → Austin is of course one that I’ve followed before, over a longer timescale.
Two quick announcements:
First, at the suggestion of reader Sanketh Menda, I’m thinking of holding a Shtetl-Optimized meetup in Waterloo this week. Please send me an email if you’re interested, and we’ll figure out a time and place that work for everyone.
Second, many of the videos from the IAS summer school are now available, including mine: Part I and Part II. I cover some basics of complexity theory, the complexity of quantum states and unitary transformations, the Harlow-Hayden argument about the complexity of turning a black hole event horizon into a firewall (with my refinement), and my and Lenny Susskind’s work on circuit complexity, wormholes, and AdS/CFT. As a special bonus, check out the super-embarrassing goof at the beginning of my first lecture—claiming a mistaken symmetry of conditional entropy and even attributing it to Edward Witten’s lecture! (But Witten, who I met for the first time on this visit, was kind enough to call my talk “lots of fun” anyway, and give me other positive comments, which I should put on my CV or something.)
Addendum: Many of the PITP videos are well worth watching! As one example, I found Witten’s talks to be shockingly accessible. I’d been to a previous talk of his involving Khovanov homology, but beyond the first few minutes, it went so far over my head that I couldn’t tell you how it was for its intended audience. I’d also been to a popular talk of Witten’s on string theory, but that’s something he could do with only 3 awake brain cells. In these talks, by contrast, Witten proves some basic inequalities of classical and quantum information theory, then proves the Reeh-Schlieder Theorem of quantum field theory and the Hawking and Penrose singularity theorems of GR, and finally uses quantum information theory to prove positive energy conditions from quantum field theory that are often needed to make statements about GR.",2549,"['bb1551f2949ceba5d83119a80f41eadf54456469bdb262eec3be95beeb3fc422', '8c1212f6f106672d408f4a1a2a021000e2f8fff1ce94e54ffcca79589a4351a0', 'ed3336a98a7330b5c94607e3363cd683b75a35944520a771f9549e32255911da', '2eb614b068d8f1fa88aaec0d58fdabdb9aaf7be45bef407b0058b01f76f416eb', 'a17df0b512fc9589ae60a2461d0e50be9dc55080bb6334fe1c71079bfd2df8da', '7613539190ca42c09ec0ed1648b7557acaadaf03eef95ef44c2f84a7d2c552b5', 'e06cb6baf018dac10ce88e4d5478a715ffb0282564484daaa802cf154b9d4a7a', '822fe9e0d8df50261d60f1d17abf85562ca42105600c8ab54941d6d869ee9210', 'c943c62e3c54b96df371f9fa94d009559c7b4e836ea2d045373719ad704df214', 'fff86152fd26d11d8218e54d27f31572b5e71c11085447b0331bb6eba3bdbe57', 'ce494dfce92dd935308bc484cbd85af957bb22c129d96176be94dab8c2bd83bc', '0820f18842bc648a78eea148e5f25e3b0b43fcc53f9380dfc9a877dea1ea5fd2', '0ffc8d9cd189fc497314957996e4a399e9f7889e99433a2224e1d66a84558a0f', '25efa5d30619b5ce3c2c9c1569ee88dc0e634cf8fcb47e9afff1820dbfdf3003', '0b57b6499eea6fd1913c94cfaee3c2c686176d7485b30d45c25d86b20b26feba', '7dab032ca000719ff4a19ca3e57cf9e17f01f3c900ebff7f8c891db5e9c7eaea', '2e3199d981b969b6cde3557290ca89ff2792e2b882f9c6a9578e156265bae455', '4055d99a623b82893bcbe9d1acdaac73f586f455035c451b009a0540d1ca3600', 'a7517296f060df0eb01b91f7c9a9644f03515614bfbb5dd5dba765e975783177']"

But I now face the happy obligation of taking a break from all the lecture-preparing and schmoozing, to blog about a striking new result by a student of mine—a result that will probably make an appearance in my lectures as well.
Yesterday, Ewin Tang—an 18-year-old who just finished a bachelor’s at UT Austin, and who will be starting a PhD in CS at the University of Washington in the fall—posted a preprint entitled A quantum-inspired classical algorithm for recommendation systems. Ewin’s new algorithm solves the following problem, very loosely stated: given m users and n products, and incomplete data about which users like which products, organized into a convenient binary tree data structure; and given also the assumption that the full m×n preference matrix is low-rank (i.e., that there are not too many ways the users vary in their preferences), sample some products that a given user is likely to want to buy. This is an abstraction of the problem that’s famously faced by Amazon and Netflix, every time they tell you which books or movies you “might enjoy.” What’s striking about Ewin’s algorithm is that it uses only polylogarithmic time: that is, time polynomial in log(m), log(n), the matrix rank, and the inverses of the relevant error parameters. Admittedly, the polynomial involves exponents of 33 and 24: so, not exactly “practical”! But it seems likely to me that the algorithm will run much, much faster in practice than it can be guaranteed to run in theory. Indeed, if any readers would like to implement the thing and test it out, please let us know in the comments section!
As the title suggests, Ewin’s algorithm was directly inspired by a quantum algorithm for the same problem, which Kerenidis and Prakash (henceforth KP) gave in 2016, and whose claim to fame was that it, too, ran in polylog(m,n) time. Prior to Ewin’s result, the KP algorithm was arguably the strongest candidate there was for an exponential quantum speedup for a real-world machine learning problem. The new result thus, I think, significantly changes the landscape of quantum machine learning, by killing off one of its flagship applications. (Note that whether KP gives a real exponential speedup was one of the main open problems mentioned in John Preskill’s survey on the applications of near-term quantum computers.) At the same time, Ewin’s result yields a new algorithm that can be run on today’s computers, that could conceivably be useful to those who need to recommend products to customers, and that was only discovered by exploiting intuition that came from quantum computing. So I’d consider this both a defeat and a victory for quantum algorithms research.
This result was the outcome of Ewin’s undergraduate thesis project (!), which I supervised. A year and a half ago, Ewin took my intro quantum information class, whereupon it quickly became clear that I should offer this person an independent project. So I gave Ewin the problem of proving a poly(m,n) lower bound on the number of queries that any classical randomized algorithm would need to make to the user preference data, in order to generate product recommendations for a given user, in exactly the same setting that KP had studied. This seemed obvious to me: in their algorithm, KP made essential use of quantum phase estimation, the same primitive used in Shor’s factoring algorithm. Without phase estimation, you seemed to be stuck doing linear algebra on the full m×n matrix, which of course would take poly(m,n) time. But KP had left the problem open, I didn’t know how to solve it either, and nailing it down seemed like an obvious challenge, if we wanted to establish the reality of quantum speedups for at least one practical machine learning problem. (For the difficulties in finding such speedups, see my essay for Nature Physics, much of which is still relevant even though it was written prior to KP.)
Anyway, for a year, Ewin tried and failed to rule out a superfast classical algorithm for the KP problem—eventually, of course, discovering the unexpected reason for the failure! Throughout this journey, I served as Ewin’s occasional sounding board, but can take no further credit for the result. Indeed, I admit that I was initially skeptical when Ewin told me that phase estimation did not look essential after all for generating superfast recommendations—that a classical algorithm could get a similar effect by randomly sampling a tiny submatrix of the user preference matrix, and then carefully exploiting a variant of a 2004 result by Frieze, Kannan, and Vempala. So when I was in Berkeley a few weeks ago for the Simons quantum computing program, I had the idea of flying Ewin over to explain the new result to the experts, including Kerenidis and Prakash themselves. After four hours of lectures and Q&A, a consensus emerged that the thing looked solid. Only after that gauntlet did I advise Ewin to put the preprint online.
So what’s next? Well, one obvious challenge is to bring down the running time of Ewin’s algorithm, and (as I mentioned before) to investigate whether or not it could give a practical benefit today. A different challenge is to find some other example of a quantum algorithm that solves a real-world machine learning problem with only a polylogarithmic number of queries … one for which the exponential quantum speedup will hopefully be Ewin-proof, ideally even provably so! The field is now wide open. It’s possible that my Forrelation problem, which Raz and Tal recently used for their breakthrough oracle separation between BQP and PH, could be an ingredient in such a separation.
Anyway, there’s much more to say about Ewin’s achievement, but I now need to run to lecture about quantum algorithms like Simon’s and Shor’s, which do achieve provable exponential speedups in query complexity! Please join me in offering hearty congratulations, see Ewin’s nicely-written paper for details, and if you have any questions for me or (better yet) Ewin, feel free to ask in the comments.
Update: On the Hacker News thread, some commenters are lamenting that such a brilliant mind as Ewin’s would spend its time figuring out how to entice consumers to buy even more products that they don’t need. I confess that that’s an angle that hadn’t even occurred to me: I simply thought that it was a beautiful question whether you actually need a quantum computer to sample the rows of a partially-specified low-rank matrix in polylogarithmic time, and if the application to recommendation systems helped to motivate that question, then so much the better. Now, though, I feel compelled to point out that, in addition to the potentially lucrative application to Amazon and Netflix, research on low-rank matrix sampling algorithms might someday find many other, more economically worthless applications as well.

So I sent her the response below, and then decided that it might be of broader interest.
Shtetl-Optimized regulars and QC aficionados will find absolutely nothing new here—move right along, you’ve been warned. But I decided to post my (slightly edited) response to Rebecca anyway, for two reasons. First, so I have something to send anyone who asks me the same question in the future—something that, moreover, as Feynman said about the Feynman Lectures on Physics, contains views “not far from my own.” And second, because, while of course I’ve written many other popular-level quantum computing essays, with basically all of them, my goal was to get the reader to hear the music, so to speak. On reflection, though, I think there might also be some value in a piece for business and policy people (not to mention humanist intellectuals) that sets aside the harmony of the interfering amplitudes, and just tries to convey some of the words to the song without egregious howlers—which is what Rebecca’s question about “political and security problems” forced me to do. This being quantum computing, of course, much of what one finds in the press doesn’t even get the lyrics right! So without further ado:
Dear Rebecca,
If you want something serious and thoughtful about your question, you probably won’t do much better than the recent essay “The Potential Impact of Quantum Computers on Society,” by my longtime friend and colleague Ronald de Wolf.
To elaborate my own thoughts, though: I feel like the political and security problems raised by quantum computing are mostly the usual ones raised by any new technology (national prestige competitions, haves vs have-nots, etc)—but with one added twist, coming from quantum computers’ famous ability to break our current methods for public-key cryptography.
As Ronald writes, you should think of a quantum computer as a specialized device, which is unlikely to improve all or even most of what we do with today’s computers, but which could give dramatic speedups for a few specific problems. There are three most important types of applications that we know about today:
(1) Simulation of quantum physics and chemistry. This was Richard Feynman’s original application when he proposed quantum computing in 1981, and I think it’s still the most important one economically. Having a fast, general-purpose quantum simulator could help a lot in designing new drugs, materials, solar cells, high-temperature superconductors, chemical reactions for making fertilizer, etc. Obviously, these are not applications like web browsing or email that will directly affect the everyday computer user. But they’re areas where you’d only need a few high-profile successes to generate billions of dollars of value.
(2) Breaking existing public-key cryptography. This is the most direct political and security implication. Every time you visit a website that begins with “https,” the authentication and encryption—including, e.g., protecting your credit card number—happen using a cryptosystem based on factoring integers or discrete logarithms or a few other related problems in number theory. A full, universal quantum computer, if built, is known to be able to break all of this.
Having said that, we all know today that hackers, and intelligence agencies, can compromise people’s data in hundreds of more prosaic ways than by building a quantum computer! Usually they don’t even bother trying to break the encryption, relying instead on poor implementations and human error.
And it’s also important to understand that a quantum computer wouldn’t mean the end of online security. There are public-key cryptosystems currently under development—most notably, those based on lattices—that are believed to resist attack even by quantum computers; NIST is planning to establish standards for these systems over the next few years. Switching to these “post-quantum” systems would be a significant burden, much like fixing the Y2K bug (and they’re also somewhat slower than our current systems), but hopefully it would only need to happen once.
As you might imagine, there’s some interest in switching to post-quantum cryptosystems even now—for example, if you wanted to encrypt messages today with some confidence they won’t be decrypted even 30 years from now. Google did a trial of a post-quantum cryptosystem two years ago. On the other hand, given that
a large fraction of web servers still use 512-bit “export grade” cryptography that was already breakable in the 1990s (good news: commenter Viktor Dukhovni tells me that this has now been mostly fixed, since security experts, including my childhood friend Alex Halderman, raised a stink about it a few years ago), it’s a safe bet that getting everyone to upgrade would take quite a long time, even if the experts agreed (which they don’t yet) which of the various post-quantum cryptosystems should become the new standard. And since, as I said, most attacks target mistakes in implementation rather than the underlying cryptography, we should expect any switch to post-quantum cryptography to make security worse rather than better in the short run.
As a radical alternative to post-quantum crypto, there’s also (ironically enough) quantum cryptography, which doesn’t work over the existing Internet—it requires setting up new communications infrastructure—but which has already been deployed in a tiny number of places, and which promises security based only on quantum physics (and, of course, on the proper construction of the hardware), as opposed to mathematical problems that a quantum computer or any other kind of computer could potentially solve. According to a long-running joke (or not-quite-joke) in our field, one of the central applications of quantum computing will be to create demand for quantum cryptography!
Finally, there’s private-key cryptography—i.e., the traditional kind, where the sender and recipient meet in secret to agree on a key in advance—which is hardly threatened by quantum computing at all: you can achieve the same level of security as before, we think, by simply doubling the key lengths. If there’s no constraint on key length, then the ultimate here is the one-time pad, which when used correctly, is theoretically unbreakable by anything short of actual physical access to the sender or recipient (e.g., hacking their computers, or beating down their doors with an ax). But while private-key crypto might be fine for spy agencies, it’s impractical for widespread deployment on the Internet, unless we also have a secure way to distribute the keys. This is precisely where public-key crypto typically gets used today, and where quantum crypto could in principle be used in the future: to exchange private keys that are then used to encrypt and decrypt the actual data.
I should also mention that, because it breaks elliptic-curve-based signature schemes, a quantum computer might let a thief steal billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin. Again, this could in principle be fixed by migrating Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) to quantum-resistant cryptographic problems, but that hasn’t been done yet.
(3) Optimization and machine learning. These are obviously huge application areas for industry, defense, and pretty much anything else. The main issue is just that we don’t know how to get as large a speedup from a quantum computer as we’d like for these applications. A quantum computer, we think, will often be able to solve optimization and machine learning problems in something like the square root of the number of steps that would be needed classically, using variants of what’s called Grover’s algorithm. So, that’s significant, but it’s not the exponential speedup and complete game-changer that we’d have for quantum simulation or for breaking public-key cryptography. Most likely, a quantum computer will be able to achieve exponential speedups for these sorts of problems only in special cases, and no one knows yet how important those special cases will be in practice. This is a still-developing research area—there might be further theoretical breakthroughs (in inventing new quantum algorithms, analyzing old algorithms, matching the performance of the quantum algorithms by classical algorithms, etc.), but it’s also possible that we won’t really understand the potential of quantum computers for these sorts of problems until we have the actual devices and can test them out.
As for how far away all this is: given the spectacular progress by Google and others over the last few years, my guess is that we’re at most a decade away from some small, special-purpose quantum computers (with ~50-200 qubits) that could be useful for quantum simulation. These are what the physicist John Preskill called “Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum” (NISQ) computers in his excellent recent essay.
However, my guess is also that it will take longer than that to get the full, error-corrected, universal quantum computers that would be needed for optimization and (most relevant to your question) for breaking public-key cryptography. Currently, the engineering requirements for a “full, universal” quantum computer look downright scary—so we’re waiting either for further breakthroughs that would cut the costs by a few more orders of magnitude (which, by their very nature, can’t be predicted), or for some modern-day General Groves and Oppenheimer who’d be licensed to spend however many hundreds of billions of dollars it would take to make it happen sooner.
The race to build “NISQ” devices has been heating up, with a shift from pure academic research to venture capitalists and industrial efforts just within the last 4-5 years, noticeably changing the character of our field.
In this particular race, I think that the US is the clear world leader right now—specifically, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, University of Maryland / NIST, and various startups—followed by Europe (with serious experimental efforts in the Netherlands, Austria, and the UK among other places). Here I should mention that the EU has a new 1-billion-Euro initiative in quantum information. Other countries that have made or are now making significant investments include Canada, Australia, China, and Israel. Surprisingly, there’s been very little investment in Russia in this area, and less than I would’ve expected in Japan.
China is a very interesting case. They’ve chosen to focus less on quantum computing than on the related areas of quantum communication and cryptography, where they’ve become the world leader. Last summer, in a big upset, China launched the first satellite (“Micius”) specifically for quantum communications, and were able to use it to do quantum cryptography and to distribute entanglement over thousands of miles (from one end of China to the other), the previous record being maybe 100 miles. If the US has anything comparable to this, it isn’t publicly known (my guess is that we don’t).
This past year, there were hearings in Congress about the need for the US to invest more in quantum information, for example to keep up with China, and it looks likely to happen. As indifferent or hostile as the current administration has been toward science more generally, the government and defense people I’ve met are very much on board with quantum information—often more so than I am! I’ve even heard China’s Micius satellite referred to as the “quantum Sputnik,” the thing that will spur the US and others to spend much more to keep up.
As you’d imagine, part of me is delighted that something so abstruse, and interesting for fundamental science, and close to my heart, is now getting attention and funding at this level. But part of me is worried by how much of the current boom I know to be fueled by misconceptions, among policymakers and journalists and the general public, about what quantum computers will be able to do for us once we have them. Basically, people think they’ll be magic oracles that will solve all problems faster, rather than just special classes of problems like the ones I enumerated above—and that they’ll simply allow the continuation of the Moore’s Law that we know and love, rather than being something fundamentally different. I’ve been trying to correct these misconceptions, on my blog and elsewhere, to anyone who will listen, for all the good that’s done! In any case, the history of AI reminds us that a crash could easily follow the current boom-time, if the results of quantum computing research don’t live up to people’s expectations.
I guess there’s one final thing I’ll say. Quantum computers are sometimes analogized to nuclear weapons, as a disruptive technology with implications for global security that scientists theorized about decades before it became technically feasible. But there are some fundamental differences. Most obviously: the deterrent value of a nuclear weapon comes if everyone knows you have it but you never need to use it, whereas the intelligence value of a quantum computer comes if you use it but no one knows you have it.
(Which is related to how the Manhattan Project entered the world’s consciousness in August 1945, whereas Bletchley Park—which was much more important to the actual winning of WWII—remained secret until the 1970s.)
As I said before, once your adversaries realized that you had a universal quantum computer, or might have one soon, they could switch to quantum-resistant forms of encryption, at least for their most sensitive secrets—in which case, as far as encryption was concerned, everyone would be more-or-less back where they started. Such a switch would be onerous, cost billions of dollars, and (in practice) probably open up its own security holes unrelated to quantum computing. But we think we already basically understand how to do it.
This is one reason why, even in a hypothetical future where hostile powers got access to quantum computers (and despite the past two years, I still don’t think of the US as a “hostile power”—I mean, like, North Korea or ISIS or something…!)—even in that future, I’d still be much less concerned about the hostile powers having this brand-new technology, than I’d be about their having the generations-old technology of fission and fusion bombs.
Best,
Scott

True story. A couple nights ago, I was sitting in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament building, watching Gilles Brassard and Charles Bennett receive the Wolf Prize in Physics for their foundational contributions to quantum computing and information. (The other laureates included, among others, Beilinson and Drinfeld in mathematics; the American honeybee researcher Gene Robinson; and Sir Paul McCartney, who did not show up for the ceremony.)
Along with the BB84 quantum cryptography scheme, the discovery of quantum teleportation, and much else, Bennett and Brassard’s seminal work included some of the first quantum oracle results, such as the BBBV Theorem (Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, Vazirani), which proved the optimality of Grover’s search algorithm, and thus the inability of quantum computers to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time in the black-box setting. It thereby set the stage for much of my own career. Of course, the early giants were nice enough to bequeath to us a few problems they weren’t able to solve, such as: is there an oracle relative to which quantum computers can solve some problem outside the entire polynomial hierarchy (PH)? That particular problem, in fact, had been open from 1993 all the way to the present, resisting sporadic attacks by me and others.
As I sat through the Wolf Prize ceremony — the speeches in Hebrew that I only 20% understood (though with these sorts of speeches, you can sort of fill in the inspirational sayings for yourself); the applause as one laureate after another announced that they were donating their winnings to charity; the ironic spectacle of far-right, ultranationalist Israeli politicians having to sit through a beautiful (and uncensored) choral rendition of John Lennon’s “Imagine” — I got an email from my friend and colleague Avishay Tal. Avishay wrote that he and Ran Raz had just posted a paper online giving an oracle separation between BQP and PH, thereby putting to rest that quarter-century-old problem. So I was faced with a dilemma: do I look up, at the distinguished people from the US, Canada, Japan, and elsewhere winning medals in Israel, or down at my phone, at the bombshell paper by two Israelis now living in the US?
For those tuning in from home, BQP, or Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial Time, is the class of decision problems efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. PH, or the Polynomial Hierarchy, is a generalization of NP to allow multiple quantifiers (e.g., does there exist a setting of these variables such that for every setting of those variables, this Boolean formula is satisfied?). These are two of the most fundamental complexity classes, which is all the motivation one should need for wondering whether the former is contained in the latter. If additional motivation is needed, though, we’re effectively asking: could quantum computers still solve problems that were classically hard, even in a hypothetical world where P=NP (and hence P=PH also)? If so, the problems in question could not be any of the famous ones like factoring or discrete logarithms; they’d need to be stranger problems, for which a classical computer couldn’t even recognize a solution efficiently, let alone finding it.
And just so we’re on the same page: if BQP ⊆ PH, then one could hope for a straight-up proof of the containment, but if BQP ⊄ PH, then there’s no way to prove such a thing unconditionally, without also proving (at a minimum) that P ≠ PSPACE. In the latter case, the best we can hope is to provide evidence for a non-containment—for example, by showing that BQP ⊄ PH relative to a suitable oracle. What’s noteworthy here is that even the latter, limited goal remained elusive for decades.
In 1993, Bernstein and Vazirani defined an oracle problem called Recursive Fourier Sampling (RFS), and proved it was in BQP but not in BPP (Bounded-Error Probabilistic Polynomial-Time). One can also show without too much trouble that RFS is not in NP or MA, though one gets stuck trying to put it outside AM. Bernstein and Vazirani conjectured—at least verbally, I don’t think in writing—that RFS wasn’t even in the polynomial hierarchy. In 2003, I did some work on Recursive Fourier Sampling, but was unable to find a version that I could prove was outside PH.
Maybe this is a good place to explain that, by a fundamental connection made in the 1980s, proving that oracle problems are outside the polynomial hierarchy is equivalent to proving lower bounds on the sizes of AC0 circuits—or more precisely, constant-depth Boolean circuits with unbounded fan-in and a quasipolynomial number of AND, OR, and NOT gates. And proving lower bounds on the sizes of AC0 circuits is (just) within complexity theory’s existing abilities—that’s how, for example, Furst-Saxe-Sipser, Ajtai, and Yao managed to show that PH ≠ PSPACE relative to a suitable oracle (indeed, even a random oracle with probability 1). Alas, from a lower bounds standpoint, Recursive Fourier Sampling is a horrendously complicated problem, and none of the existing techniques seemed to work for it. And that wasn’t even the only problem: even if one somehow succeeded, the separation that one could hope for from RFS was only quasipolynomial (n versus nlog n), rather than exponential.
Ten years ago, as I floated in a swimming pool in Cambridge, MA, it occurred to me that RFS was probably the wrong way to go. If you just wanted an oracle separation between BQP and PH, you should focus on a different kind of problem—something like what I’d later call Forrelation. The Forrelation problem asks: given black-box access to two Boolean functions f,g:{0,1}n→{0,1}, are f and g random and independent, or are they random individually but with each one close to the Boolean Fourier transform of the other one? It’s easy to give a quantum algorithm to solve Forrelation, even with only 1 query. But the quantum algorithm really seems to require querying all the f- and g-inputs in superposition, to produce an amplitude that’s a global sum of f(x)g(y) terms with massive cancellations in it. It’s not clear how we’d reproduce this behavior even with the full power of the polynomial hierarchy. To be clear: to answer the question, it would suffice to show that no AC0 circuit with exp(poly(n)) gates could distinguish a “Forrelated” distribution over (f,g) pairs from the uniform distribution.
Using a related problem, I managed to show that, relative to a suitable oracle—in fact, even a random oracle—the relational version of BQP (that is, the version where we allow problems with many valid outputs) is not contained in the relational version of PH. I also showed that a lower bound for Forrelation itself, and hence an oracle separation between the “original,” decision versions of BQP and PH, would follow from something that I called the “Generalized Linial-Nisan Conjecture.” This conjecture talked about the inability of AC0 circuits to distinguish the uniform distribution from distributions that “looked close to uniform locally.” My banging the drum about this, I’m happy to say, initiated a sequence of events that culminated in Mark Braverman’s breakthrough proof of the original Linial-Nisan Conjecture. But alas, I later discovered that my generalized version is false. This meant that different circuit lower bound techniques, ones more tailored to problems like Forrelation, would be needed to go the distance.
I never reached the promised land. But my consolation prize is that Avishay and Ran have now done so, by taking Forrelation as their jumping-off point but then going in directions that I’d never considered.
As a first step, Avishay and Ran modify the Forrelation problem so that, in the “yes” case, the correlation between f and the Fourier transform of g is much weaker (though still detectable using a quantum algorithm that makes nO(1) queries to f and g). This seems like an inconsequential change—sure, you can do that, but what does it buy you?—but it turns out to be crucial for their analysis. Ultimately, this change lets them show that, when we write down a polynomial that expresses an AC0 circuit’s bias in detecting the forrelation between f and g, all the “higher-order contributions”—those involving a product of k terms of the form f(x) or g(y), for some k>2—get exponentially damped as a function of k, so that only the k=2 contributions still matter.
There are a few additional ideas that Raz and Tal need to finish the job. First, they relax the Boolean functions f and g to real-valued, Gaussian-distributed functions—very similar to what Andris Ambainis and I did when we proved a nearly-tight randomized lower bound for Forrelation, except that they also need to truncate f and g so they take values in [-1,1]; they then prove that a multilinear polynomial has no way to distinguish their real-valued functions from the original Boolean ones. Second, they exploit recent results of Tal about the Fourier spectra of AC0 functions. Third, they exploit recent work of Chattopadhyay et al. on pseudorandom generators from random walks (Chattopadhyay, incidentally, recently finished his PhD at UT Austin). A crucial idea turns out to be to think of the values of f(x) and g(y), in a real-valued Forrelation instance, as sums of huge numbers of independent random contributions. Formally, this changes nothing: you end up with exactly the same Gaussian distributions that you had before. Conceptually, though, you can look at how each tiny contribution changes the distinguishing bias, conditioned on the sum of all the previous contributions; and this leads to the suppression of higher-order terms that we talked about before, with the higher-order terms going to zero as the step size does.
Stepping back from the details, though, let me talk about a central conceptual barrier—one that I know from an email exchange with Avishay was on his and Ran’s minds, even though they never discuss it explicitly in their paper. In my 2009 paper, I identified what I argued was the main reason why no existing technique was able to prove an oracle separation between BQP and PH. The reason was this: the existing techniques, based on the Switching Lemma and so forth, involved arguing (often implicitly) that
- any AC0 circuit can be approximated by a low-degree real polynomial, but
- the function that we’re trying to compute can’t be approximated by a low-degree real polynomial.
Linial, Mansour, and Nisan made this fully explicit in the context of their learning algorithm for AC0. And this is all well and good if, for example, we’re trying to prove the n-bit PARITY function is not in AC0, since PARITY is famously inapproximable by any polynomial of sublinear degree. But what if we’re trying to separate BQP from PH? In that case, we need to deal with the fundamental observation of Beals et al. 1998: that any function with a fast quantum algorithm, by virtue of having a fast quantum algorithm, is approximable by a low-degree real polynomial! Approximability by low-degree polynomials giveth with the one hand and taketh away with the other.
To be sure, I pointed out that this barrier wasn’t necessarily insuperable. For the precise meaning of “approximable by low-degree polynomials” that follows from a function’s being in BQP, might be different from the meaning that’s used to put the function outside of PH. As one illustration, Razborov and Smolensky’s AC0 lower bound method relates having a small constant-depth circuit to being approximable by low-degree polynomials over finite fields, which is different from being approximable by low-degree polynomials over the reals. But this didn’t mean I knew an actual way around the barrier: I had no idea how to prove that Forrelation wasn’t approximable by low-degree polynomials over finite fields either.
So then how do Raz and Tal get around the barrier? Apparently, by exploiting the fact that Tal’s recent results imply much more than just that AC0 functions are approximable by low-degree real polynomials. Rather, they imply approximability by low-degree real polynomials with bounded L1 norms (i.e., sums of absolute values) of their coefficients. And crucially, these norm bounds even apply to the degree-2 part of a polynomial—showing that, even all the way down there, the polynomial can’t be “spread around,” with equal weight on all its coefficients. But being “spread around” is exactly how the true polynomial for Forrelation—the one that you derive from the quantum algorithm—works. The polynomial looks like this:
$$ p(f,g) = \frac{1}{2^{3n/2}} \sum_{x,y \in \left\{0,1\right\}^n} (-1)^{x \cdot y} f(x) g(y). $$
This still isn’t enough for Raz and Tal to conclude that Forrelation itself is not in AC0: after all, the higher-degree terms in the polynomial might somehow compensate for the failures of the lower-degree terms. But this difference between the two different kinds of low-degree polynomial—the “thin” kind that you get from AC0 circuits, and the “thick” kind that you get from quantum algorithms—gives them an opening that they’re able to combine with the other ideas mentioned above, at least for their noisier version of the Forrelation problem.
This difference between “thin” and “thick” polynomials is closely related to, though not identical with, a second difference, which is that any AC0 circuit needs to compute some total Boolean function, whereas a quantum algorithm is allowed to be indecisive on many inputs, accepting them with a probability that’s close neither to 0 nor to 1. Tal used the fact that an AC0 circuit computes a total Boolean function, in his argument showing that it gives rise to a “thin” low-degree polynomial. His argument also implies that no low-degree polynomial that’s “thick,” like the above quantum-algorithm-derived polynomial for Forrelation, can possibly represent a total Boolean function: it must be indecisive on many inputs.
The boundedness of the L1 norm of the coefficients is related to a different condition on low-degree polynomials, which I called the “low-fat condition” in my Counterexample to the Generalized Linial-Nisan Conjecture paper. However, the whole point of that paper was that the low-fat condition turns out not to work, in the sense that there exist depth-three AC0 circuits that are not approximable by any low-degree polynomials satisfying the condition. Raz and Tal’s L1 boundedness condition, besides being simpler, also has the considerable advantage that it works.
As Lance Fortnow writes, in his blog post about this achievment, an obvious next step would be to give an oracle relative to which P=NP but P≠BQP. I expect that this can be done. Another task is to show that my original Forrelation problem is not in PH—or more generally, to broaden the class of problems that can be handled using Raz and Tal’s methods. And then there’s one of my personal favorite problems, which seems closely related to BQP vs. PH even though it’s formally incomparable: give an oracle relative to which a quantum computer can’t always prove its answer to a completely classical skeptic via an interactive protocol.
Since (despite my journalist moratorium) a journalist already emailed to ask me about the practical implications of the BQP vs. PH breakthrough—for example, for the ~70-qubit quantum computers that Google and others hope to build in the near future—let me take the opportunity to say that, as far as I can see, there aren’t any. This is partly because Forrelation is an oracle problem, one that we don’t really know how to instantiate explicitly (in the sense, for example, that factoring and discrete logarithm instantiate Shor’s period-finding algorithm). And it’s partly because, even if you did want to run the quantum algorithm for Forrelation (or for Raz and Tal’s noisy Forrelation) on a near-term quantum computer, you could easily do that sans the knowledge that the problem sits outside the polynomial hierarchy.
Still, as Avi Wigderson never tires of reminding people, theoretical computer science is richly interconnected, and things can turn up in surprising places. To take a relevant example: Forrelation, which I introduced for the purely theoretical purpose of separating BQP from PH (and which Andris Ambainis and I later used for another purely theoretical purpose, to prove a maximal separation between randomized and quantum query complexities), now furnishes one of the main separating examples in the field of quantum machine learning algorithms. So it’s early to say what implications Avishay and Ran’s achievement might ultimately have. In any case, huge congratulations to them.",16688,"['b7825da4c48fae6195e5ec9730f581556b309950c506bfe43e815ea4dd662569', 'c81c79894931a0e66f92d61d17f3640518acee57415ba7fdcbc420bbbdd499d8', '9c39d8d010b403c110737d84e04346ec0dec027c02bef9388fc41628502c3709', '187d2a8fc1b4ef4da25566030d6376e94df60ac29882f6b15c26be8fb24e3b2a', '0ad3b1c4bd52f5dceaa882af8d181be655c4b2a47e0c4937b49600a4d85a6a5e', '48bce9f27670605c3bfe14822eb45fd90a9d86ccdacf177c87ec821fe127e5ec', '18e327fd59a40119d2d6e837d656faaa3514be24ad7fbc50eef60691969676d2', 'abf35d157137fe6cc84cb0abd5ff636f762dcd151408b5ce05dc0cd0523389f7', 'ea100259f2d42ec0c480575d9fd9d2f3b930a31e7af3beb0f08c66878a1a69ae', '85c0452a2943e378634d665f99240b04c2f203ee5975bb86cd2c4321c1bab0b2', '8274b2a7f9f7426397ea7ddf53ee6e8d10d32f5301d9db055b584245da860711', 'a7a0e22d910ba79588f770c645c5b816ddb64603d4c32d927820dca8be0e3b27', 'f623121cfcc88182556d1590c2ab93226e68ab8500cc0e04822e7116b2c6195f', '6e260b527fb1f6cd5775ac29e32e066cf80168cb25324f696e37ea38a06cf757', '3dbc15386f6e43901c33a7e6efb13b963006373ab6faa121ba6b51749a8acfa6', 'd276b559fcdcb43c0bfae64fd14d025ac7ad4dc361fcecfb0825ed148d16aa57', '250146a6570b9b8cc824578ae4d7be98be8d616633ae6d3ad53bd09666373c50', 'dedba0bfaf23bde28fbab9e958860a6a62f9605a8eccd57fcf35714a039f75be', '73b17ab34d90bf152c236986a7a5a0ac82c1d18b32576b7effa8d9a610979757', '11a159e91e8420ad5eae4ea57924f2b7dbffadf6a96e8ed0a6e13c7d7be46c27', '8160f301d6d16a6ad548b730a0075bd422ae5a59bcdc2681c35abda7e106339b', '3e91707bf07f234f44e3326b3b1331fabfcf622432694ae0cd2ad85211380bdb', '086e88ec68ead3663069e7a1067369d6a6a387e0c3b4d6caaac1db062bbd5399', '7347530b6ced8bb520474a1a3a12ba39b73a508d632adce333b9c313a7c5192b', '016e723849d4506759a3c1647cd90e2f81a6f26ca467b4136795e2e83d26552c', '45531e8d24fba1a321961eaacc0168687e67fbf6fa2afb090dfe333550a19042']"

- We show that combining two different hypothetical enhancements to quantum computation—namely, quantum advice and non-collapsing measurements—would let a quantum computer solve any decision problem whatsoever in polynomial time, even though neither enhancement yields extravagant power by itself. This complements a related result due to Raz. The proof uses locally decodable codes.
I welcome discussion in the comments. The real purpose of this post is simply to fulfill a request by James Gallagher, in the comments of my Robin Hanson post:
The probably last chance for humanity involves science progressing, can you apply your efforts to quantum computers, which is your expertise, and stop wasting many hours of you [sic] time with this [expletive deleted]
Indeed, I just returned to Tel Aviv, for the very tail end of my sabbatical, from a weeklong visit to Google’s quantum computing group in LA. While we mourned tragedies—multiple members of the quantum computing community lost loved ones in recent weeks—it was great to be among so many friends, and great to talk and think for once about actual progress that’s happening in the world, as opposed to people saying mean things on Twitter. Skipping over its plans to build a 49-qubit chip, Google is now going straight for 72 qubits. And we now have some viable things that one can do, or try to do, with such a chip, beyond simply proving quantum supremacy—I’ll say more about that in subsequent posts.
Anyway, besides discussing this progress, the other highlight of my trip was going from LA to Santa Barbara on the back of Google physicist Sergio Boixo’s motorcycle—weaving in and out of rush-hour traffic, the tightness of my grip the only thing preventing me from flying out onto the freeway. I’m glad to have tried it once, and probably won’t be repeating it.
Update: I posted a new version of the PDQP/qpoly=ALL paper, which includes an observation about communication complexity, and which—inspired by the comments section—clarifies that when I say “all languages,” I really do mean “all languages” (even the halting problem).",2240,"['2e7be9e5518f9eae055a4556e3cbc094b3233d5f8fa089efa7ed1356001a7135', '087732834795435eb43cc4ad61f4d12cffe8d3c4dc88e50c529127e663f3d2d3', 'ce29a211204200e955c2a69a2886e6b12c9e28bb2dc1f42fc077edcd9702c359', '4a7d6d3e8888a86b41c710f1d44c43d9ec7a4f97dce4f1ec3c0fb124ca0188de', '1ada3d22dee17617a2ee998cc6dd733a314c8fb9f1fdc8e1bafa113e95b0fc03', '1acf8eef5d56e6379d54f782ca90fe0489cf2f5d8eaa6c2a349c5ebbc89ae8fc', '63e4eb1c198c00f1332ea76bacd249f94031789d59adb2df572ae3345b278fea', 'd6b41344d80eed70604b1fef0f02f1c6f36a8289cf86e2ed0e9fcd690c3d7b4d', '9e7fcda1de53c229dec85a67ea6e110aa102b494c932e9c4e545099653a27d78', 'fc9ecce0bf470427772bac45f0d7868d5623c95960c3a6b48391c8dd61c6e420', '40edf2a6af4f0646efed89c21d949aab61b86c685ba36015373638e7e264f8bb', '3afdda2c098fc8346a9f2e0ba06ec9c6188411cf78cc7934cfd8b666ce632f55', 'edd4a9c34e65d1b0061047ad0d8fa1f50cdb9a0ea1fa7175e9e487b7e8c8ce3b', '7123e61c55f52e31ec47088be530d2fa59ac363e1af3ab46fbe0fb3880113121', 'bf9e41bf76fd84706d25434b5242aebbfc3e761a3e2b4b31a92dfcb40e4b4af0', 'bce5c4e5cc85cf0bf42973133c73dcf46b6c50d12c2b017663f254b1ff35342c', '1bfdd71a08e7b997b94e8f0781cc638ebb936c03554d23266d689e85a95a260b', 'b4a98279fafd7076fdbdcf72ef8d8ac372335916b2c77a6209367f309bd5e1cb', '51c42c5d4cd8d244fb2309a67c3d557ee2d27babf0dfb35ee3b7ffc664c03724', '51e80b3849ce5be2171745150c06d2e5fba27cab5b5cfc66319e11185b98c230', '5a3c066db0f4b004822dab1fa2e0b468422027ce16e47bfa797e51578e6c38e7', '8b71ced1bf8bf8ff44029ace23b2cd9909ccd9400cc66c3ea1c54d0c1dfbdc73', 'e503ba768656015c0d8fe6834ef949387e252028a43d2822c7c4efee50e13900', '8a7ae0efb6e76bb7850cfff6bacf8e0e23aed1d257563aaefcdbcba792d91f3c', '0fbf7f3ba8d29c6397041dd7f4e298d93ed643b137732018ed929d9f90034411', '46d6623a6b33a30aed8c571cd0c013989b8bd1c12b7a9cfec5d2a7962486a264', '4d9eae5d02c2d4c49b863fb65c181475c598a2359ecbb1146dc0465ccf153171', 'a4bcf8c123e3399b84c337ebdc4e081c46ce3c7d41e4ee69d2928d109281a56c', 'ac7f3ad15a27e153e964150fd7537db4c8d1eda602a119864e470536e7c3c418', '80e628d670b6d01068c98c5a2325d071a170c70e1d953268ad6b116125b32091', 'ccbb02fdefa1a3b95e4ba8ac7a789d9c97ed70d1854b5847590b1b17a2c50979', '2cce4c9a1e01d011f7f03c4809da88d72fc70f6b85b78086b0c2159d3e170453', '004bc54180046c2aefd8077709a8765512ba1e1e7480734b81c2cbfeb9d096f1', 'b5d41d5ce442e370a07804f2b3ffdc0fb5aca892c705809351dae09ffa8d5681', 'dd10f724d9cc96b356cb8e92e251ad5556f2297bd60060c94963f2d261d6557d', 'f5f6946c5746b988055a627641874347ca8b09fea62cdaa5d14c10471b31c26c', '5f60e0523d0e3c01334f3baf7be5bcf671b48944a6afc82146dc720434c6d107', 'ea4809af448a7c4fcb527ab5b72aa9eac10b857b264f02dc9e174868be1a53aa', '5fe35b73fd6f8f11029a539c0953e128cb9f620c685dfb94d69fef539eab07c5', 'f03ecc1606812fffe4a3e81d80b0d713012157ef8883181e818dff9b715f1679']"
111,3645,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3645,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2018-02-13,Scott Aaronson,Review of Vivek Wadhwa’s Washington Post column on quantum computing,"Various people pointed me to a Washington Post piece by Vivek Wadhwa, entitled “Quantum computers may be more of an immiment threat than AI.” I know I’m late to the party, but in the spirit of Pete Wells’ famous New York Times “review” of Guy Fieri’s now-closed Times Square restaurant, I have a few questions that have been gnawing at me:
Mr. Wadhwa, when you decided to use the Traveling Salesman Problem as your go-to example of a problem that quantum computers can solve quickly, did the thought ever cross your mind that maybe you should look this stuff up first—let’s say, on Wikipedia? Or that you should email one person—just one, anywhere on the planet—who works in quantum algorithms?
When you wrote of the Traveling Salesman Problem that “[i]t would take a laptop computer 1,000 years to compute the most efficient route between 22 cities”—how confident are you about that? Willing to bet your house? Your car? How much would it blow your mind if I told you that a standard laptop, running a halfway decent algorithm, could handle 22 cities in a fraction of a second?
When you explained that quantum computing is “equivalent to opening a combination lock by trying every possible number and sequence simultaneously,” where did this knowledge come from? Did it come from the same source you consulted before you pronounced the death of Bitcoin … in January 2016?
Had you wanted to consult someone who knew the first thing about quantum computing, the subject of your column, would you have been able to use a search engine to find one? Or would you have simply found another “expert,” in the consulting or think-tank worlds, who “knew” the same things about quantum computing that you do?
Incidentally, when you wrote that quantum computing “could pose a greater burden on businesses than the Y2K computer bug did toward the end of the ’90s,” were you trying to communicate how large the burden might be?
And when you wrote that
[T]here is substantial progress in the development of algorithms that are “quantum safe.” One promising field is matrix multiplication, which takes advantage of the techniques that allow quantum computers to be able to analyze so much information.
—were you generating random text using one of those Markov chain programs? If not, then what were you referring to?
Would you agree that the Washington Post has been a leader in investigative journalism exposing Trump’s malfeasance? Do you, like me, consider them one of the most important venues on earth for people to be able to trust right now? How does it happen that the Washington Post publishes a quantum computing piece filled with errors that would embarrass a high-school student doing a term project (and we won’t even count the reference to Stephen “Hawkings”—that’s a freebie)?
Were the fact-checkers home with the flu? Did they give your column a pass simply because it was “perspective” rather than news? Or did they trust you as a widely-published technology expert? How does one become such an expert, anyway?
Thanks!
Update (Feb. 21): For casual readers, Vivek Wadhwa quickly came into the comments section to try to defend himself—before leaving in a huff as a chorus of commenters tried to explain why he was wrong. As far as I know, he has not posted any corrections to his Washington Post piece. Wadhwa’s central defense was that he was simply repeating what Michelle Simmons, a noted quantum computing experimentalist in Australia, said in various talks in YouTube—which turns out to be largely true (though Wadhwa said explicitly that quantum computers could efficiently solve TSP, while Simmons mostly left this as an unstated implication). As a result, while Wadhwa should obviously have followed the journalistic practice of checking incredible-sounding claims—on Wikipedia if nowhere else!—before repeating them in the Washington Post, I now feel that Simmons shares in the responsibility for this. As John Preskill tweeted, an excellent lesson to draw from this affair is that everyone in our field needs to be careful to say things that are true when speaking to the public.",4091,"['462ba5be4c30700391e2149d56dec0ed12d1e3e5c6b8be192b48fb8d8f3dca51', '9a18e3be969d331e315b21ad7355f8e11960bf586269bc4c233a086b5c07e8a5',

112,3638,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3638,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2018-02-05,Scott Aaronson,Three updates,"- I was extremely sorry to learn about the loss of Joe Polchinski, a few days ago, to brain cancer. Joe was a leading string theorist, one of the four co-discoverers of the AMPS firewall paradox, and one of the major figures in the Simons It from Qubit collaboration that I’ve been happy to be part of since its inception. I regret that I didn’t get to know Joe as well as I should have, but he was kind to me in all of our interactions. He’ll be missed by all who knew him.
- Edge has posted what will apparently be its final Annual Edge Question: “What is the last question?” They asked people to submit just a single, one sentence question “for which they’ll be remembered,” with no further explanation or elaboration. You can read mine, which not surprisingly is alphabetically the first. I tried to devise a single question that gestured toward the P vs. NP problem, and the ultimate physical limits of computation, and the prospects for superintelligent AI, and the enormity of what could be Platonically lying in wait for us within finite but exponentially search spaces, and the eternal nerd’s conundrum, of the ability to get the right answers to clearly-stated questions being so ineffectual in the actual world. I’m not thrilled with the result, but reading through the other questions makes it clear just how challenging it is to ask something that doesn’t boil down to: “When will the rest of the world recognize the importance of my research topic?”
- I’m now reaping the fruits of my decision to take a year-long sabbatical from talking to journalists. Ariel Bleicher, a writer for Quanta magazine, asked to interview me for an article she was writing about the difficulty of establishing quantum supremacy. I demurred, mentioning my sabbatical, and pointed her to others she could ask instead. Well, last week the article came out, and while much of it is quite good, it opens with an extended presentation of a forehead-bangingly wrong claim by Cristian Calude: namely, that the Deutsch-Jozsa problem (i.e. computing the parity of two bits) can be solved with one query even by a classical algorithm, so that (in effect) one of the central examples used in introductory quantum computing courses is a lie. This claim is based on a 2006 paper wherein, with all the benefits of theft over honest toil, Calude changes the query model so that you can evaluate not just the original oracle function f, but an extension of f to the complex numbers (!). Apparently Calude justifies this by saying that Deutsch also changed the problem, by allowing it to be solved with a quantum computer, so he gets to change the problem as well. The difference, of course, is that the quantum query complexity model is justified by its relevance for quantum algorithms, and (ultimately) by quantum mechanics being true of our world. Calude’s model, by contrast, is (as far as I can tell) pulled out of thin air and justified by nothing. Anyway, I regard this incident as entirely, 100% my fault, and 0% Ariel’s. How was she to know that, while there are hundreds of knowledgeable quantum computing experts to interview, almost all of them are nice and polite? Anyway, this has led me to a revised policy: while I’ll still decline interviews, news organizations should feel free to run completed quantum computing pieces by me for quick fact checks.",3343,"['abf28cbd67b6d687948ab9352408e6f383bd2b18036005ad3c1ec2ab5626c8ba', 'aa4194b8402d107705b0cfb8929e67307db0e306d8a1e9756d6c4502b1317849', 'ff35bb7a33885d6ae37a4ace3f857ccec63fe0c5a591fe1acc21fe1a7c788f87', '6cb766a36c0765e10e2702a4987f1c3c5b122185a0e6e82b12b552067da22297', '2e6f45aacba8c2cbe9e3c482e5ce243c76055af93ac8f96df4e55aaeee1f8907', 'cabb0abd38d0de47ba431d1a8017cbd2a35667f59da18a0f6f4c18923457018c', '489be0dd8c8a8c9e54d5f4e130a09f02b4a236e1621db13faae218c7c65ff099', 'de0984bf82da9429968b8a018f3d81f0d758f1d61df3f90bcaa1009b8bbc32a3', 'b6df650285999dfe6ed8c32556544f867a31d54eaaad9aee41b6cfd8402462ef', '8bc3336762a8424ae8e16497eb021a5697daefd8c6b80966a415d36525cec349', '3d2b79ef8918ab098747ec12edd3a735ac62b4b77d237730746ae2a6d668f3f1', 'de72b8f2f5ad7986658bf9c7000f7b8283ecd2fcafe7aefbad2549cf3c50ab99', '7ddc55833f108e06016dd2931ce1cad39bf931426cf846c27af02f7270ccdfd9', '308f85019fd9387add7125196bafe384997212b577fa052618eb9069a205c23f', 'e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855', '659bf6881631ec0687ac670b08a75344d17c10ddeb0fe4d46af902f1a570f433', 'f569b78bbac5bd6013bfdb4d8a7c0ce11a2f446562740a14b34101e43201fe3f', '69d8cf5a6ec667f85ed3bc522c7e18954ccbb5e670e6fdc42b0e63a678903b88', 'b848b07ec3b424a6749d1f9abbeaa0383176e0e09917890228c3360990a6e9d3', '624edb2e342ef8ebfd1ef98cf1ab654b5002a18e5f42df7e88205354466caa18', '400425493560faa7b05fe9ce59ad5fab93ed7cbe6183e08687ee1df04e663095', '1ac901f82c2d266e61c8c0ef8a5f1a639b884c4ad4e8c0e8f69637faba8ec032', '9a63def4e023f832fba0069c2e946b371b012dc686767e5de653aa4b2c741886', '1616f1f25e18bdd9aa96a61bb0be781d778b65d6546324fdc5c4238e8b92d434', 'af9157dcf97a3ea67132a24b0dd3e90dfd2901cd2c4cca0b71435fb7d4a283c6', '86b0554624d50a0b3c665a3e266549e0df741e6480c82ce0bd7ce6dfdeb964f4', 'c335bfd088987166725ed83668317d3ce7812b13f0da937c55ad5b89d5411e9f', 'b8891d7288d9eed2754e18a8052d60957500d1c1917033c43814ffa2146adce2', 'f53d092d65b3ea52bc3154a82ec9816b472ef49f25abb0c761997b28b4d3ff3c', 'fb39cf06f9b4cb839be53c83adb111e5c596038df9c30fd9532caedb384c7b43', '7d0c4a78b9923970d039d0a51a77a3239311efd57e00662fbac5d783332d05cb', '5b624d814078a81fbc7396450f5cf97760c01d52c3370fd723fa86970df970f6', '5c0f1d76e726eeaf2217ca470f9f8f39ed4102ab2afd9af0485847ff6a29c3e4', '1e5e4b669a8b26e6c38cc940ed71c17d49d471fdc8dfcbabd878a7597fed72e6', '8829c7ac327a3344765d6d857f5405bf86d230aef4299f6a74fee4e7c5710bc5', '7036936d5e3e9d336011aa082872ca01fcb950baf220e7d30a8e86c2c38f4e2a', 'f396410b5954f083ad1fe106923bccefa1ac82144d651ab3d86c11cb4c2b4954', '4b32e04f6733b968ab89b0965ab399b825e6a12a68d6f8f1bbedc87dc8a127bf', '5f1b0a60f4c2fff3c5e016e98772e172a378bb4db8d408fabff60deb204a2822', '267786ca273836f3411c8bdb39444ac0326f7fb94157c4b5a3a004403178ac71', 'ca6a981ad772cedc141b05bb82b05c60007e8512acd6b2545f29f39db374ed5e', '32a2644183697c90d6aaf9769f6b74931f9a62f30bd15a7025fb3c1620ee420c', '4587b11561d8c1e1b2312cd48aaaf2a5b601d340a03a62f4aca7b35e851b9796', 'eab507aa99e765689deb89b110b53798363b0b2f5506b853d34caf5ad6c87f21']"

But now I’m sick, and in no condition to be thinking about research. And this morning, in a thread that had turned to my views on the interpretation of quantum mechanics called “QBism,” regular commenter Atreat asked me the following pointed question:
Scott, what is your preferred interpretation of QM? I don’t think I’ve ever seen you put your cards on the table and lay out clearly what interpretation(s) you think are closest to the truth. I don’t think your ghost paper qualifies as an answer, BTW. I’ve heard you say you have deep skepticism about objective collapse theories and yet these would seemingly be right up your philosophical alley so to speak. If you had to bet on which interpretation was closest to the truth, which one would you go with?
Many people have asked me some variant of the same thing. As it happens, I’d been toying since the summer with a huge post about my views on each major interpretation, but I never quite got it into a form I wanted. By contrast, it took me only an hour to write out a reply to Atreat, and in the age of social media and attention spans measured in attoseconds, many readers will probably prefer that short reply to the huge post anyway. So then I figured, why not promote it to a full post and be done with it? So without further ado:
Dear Atreat,
It’s no coincidence that you haven’t seen me put my cards on the table with a favored interpretation of QM!
There are interpretations (like the “transactional interpretation”) that make no sense whatsoever to me.
There are “interpretations” like dynamical collapse that aren’t interpretations at all, but proposals for new physical theories. By all means, let’s test QM on larger and larger systems, among other reasons because it could tell us that some such theory is true or—vastly more likely, I think—place new limits on it! (People are trying.)
Then there’s the deBroglie-Bohm theory, which does lay its cards on the table in a very interesting way, by proposing a specific evolution rule for hidden variables (chosen to match the predictions of QM), but which thereby opens itself up to the charge of non-uniqueness: why that rule, as opposed to a thousand other rules that someone could write down? And if they all lead to the same predictions, then how could anyone ever know which rule was right?
And then there are dozens of interpretations that seem to differ from one of the “main” interpretations (Many-Worlds, Copenhagen, Bohm) mostly just in the verbal patter.
As for Copenhagen, I’ve described it as “shut-up and calculate except without ever shutting up about it”! I regard Bohr’s writings on the subject as barely comprehensible, and Copenhagen as less of an interpretation than a self-conscious anti-interpretation: a studied refusal to offer any account of the actual constituents of the world, and—most of all—an insistence that if you insist on such an account, then that just proves that you cling naïvely to a classical worldview, and haven’t grasped the enormity of the quantum revolution.
But the basic split between Many-Worlds and Copenhagen (or better: between Many-Worlds and “shut-up-and-calculate” / “QM needs no interpretation” / etc.), I regard as coming from two fundamentally different conceptions of what a scientific theory is supposed to do for you. Is it supposed to posit an objective state for the universe, or be only a tool that you use to organize your experiences?
Also, are the ultimate equations that govern the universe “real,” while tables and chairs are “unreal” (in the sense of being no more than fuzzy approximate descriptions of certain solutions to the equations)? Or are the tables and chairs “real,” while the equations are “unreal” (in the sense of being tools invented by humans to predict the behavior of tables and chairs and whatever else, while extraterrestrials might use other tools)? Which level of reality do you care about / want to load with positive affect, and which level do you want to denigrate?
This is not like picking a race horse, in the sense that there might be no future discovery or event that will tell us who was closer to the truth. I regard it as conceivable that superintelligent AIs will still argue about the interpretation of QM … or maybe that God and the angels argue about it now.
Indeed, about the only thing I can think of that might definitively settle the debate, would be the discovery of an even deeper level of description than QM—but such a discovery would “settle” the debate only by completely changing the terms of it.
I will say this, however, in favor of Many-Worlds: it’s clearly and unequivocally the best interpretation of QM, as long as we leave ourselves out of the picture! I.e., as long as we say that the goal of physics is to give the simplest, cleanest possible mathematical description of the world that somewhere contains something that seems to correspond to observation, and we’re willing to shunt as much metaphysical weirdness as needed to those who worry themselves about details like “wait, so are we postulating the physical existence of a continuum of slightly different variants of me, or just an astronomically large finite number?” (Incidentally, Max Tegmark’s “mathematical multiverse” does even better than MWI by this standard. Tegmark is the one waiting for you all the way at the bottom of the slippery slope of always preferring Occam’s Razor over trying to account for the specificity of the observed world.) It’s no coincidence, I don’t think, that MWI is so popular among those who are also eliminativists about consciousness.
When I taught my undergrad Intro to Quantum Information course last spring—for which lecture notes are coming soon, by the way!—it was striking how often I needed to resort to an MWI-like way of speaking when students got confused about measurement and decoherence. (“So then we apply this unitary transformation U that entangles the system and environment, and we compute a partial trace over the environment qubits, and we see that it’s as if the system has been measured, though of course we could in principle reverse this by applying U-1 … oh shoot, have I just conceded MWI?”)
On the other hand, when (at the TAs’ insistence) we put an optional ungraded question on the final exam that asked students their favorite interpretation of QM, we found that there was no correlation whatsoever between interpretation and final exam score—except that students who said they didn’t believe any interpretation at all, or that the question was meaningless or didn’t matter, scored noticeably higher than everyone else.
Anyway, as I said, MWI is the best interpretation if we leave ourselves out of the picture. But you object: “OK, and what if we don’t leave ourselves out of the picture? If we dig deep enough on the interpretation of QM, aren’t we ultimately also asking about the ‘hard problem of consciousness,’ much as some people try to deny that? So for example, what would it be like to be maintained in a coherent superposition of thinking two different thoughts A and B, and then to get measured in the |A⟩+|B⟩, |A⟩-|B⟩ basis? Would it even be like anything? Or is there something about our consciousness that depends on decoherence, irreversibility, full participation in the arrow of the time, not living in an enclosed little unitary box like AdS/CFT—something that we’d necessarily destroy if we tried to set up a large-scale interference experiment on our own brains, or any other conscious entities? If so, then wouldn’t that point to a strange sort of reconciliation of Many-Worlds with Copenhagen—where as soon as we had a superposition involving different subjective experiences, for that very reason its being a superposition would be forevermore devoid of empirical consequences, and we could treat it as just a classical probability distribution?”
I’m not sure, but The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine will probably have to stand as my last word (or rather, last many words) on those questions for the time being.",8151,"['031eff7a029816ea5c2cb7764a92eef948298905e411408be0980491eab48241', '5aa329d9c94772c869bd143e2196bd37073e5ef8730a300738885a5e80ed35a3',

114,3622,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3622,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2018-01-29,Scott Aaronson,Practicing the modus ponens of Twitter,"Somehow this SMBC comic is the best explanation of quantum computing for non-professionals that I’ve ever found
To which the venture capitalist Matthew Ocko replied, in another tweet:
Except Scott Aaronson is a surly little troll who has literally never built anything at all of meaning. He’s a professional critic of braver people. So, no, this is not a good explanation – anymore than Jeremy Rifkin on CRISPR would be…
Now, I don’t mind if Ocko hates me, and also hates my and Zach’s comic. What’s been bothering me is just the logic of his tweet. Like: what did he have in his head when he wrote the word “So”? Let’s suppose for the sake of argument that I’m a “surly little troll,” and an ax murderer besides. How does it follow that my explanation of quantum computing wasn’t good? To reach that stop in proposition-space, wouldn’t one still need to point to something wrong with the explanation?
But I’m certain that my inability to understand this is just another of my many failings. In a world where Trump is president, bitcoin is valued at $11,000 when I last checked, and the attack-tweet has fully replaced the argument, it’s obvious that those of us who see a word like “so” or “because,” and start looking for the inferential step, are merely insufficiently brave. For godsakes, I’m not even on Twitter! I’m a sclerotic dinosaur who needs to get with the times.
But maybe I, too, could learn the art of the naked ad-hominem. Let me try: from a Google search, we learn that Ocko is an enthusiastic investor in D-Wave. Is it possible he’s simply upset that there’s so much excitement right now in experimental quantum computing—including “things of meaning” being built by brave people, at Google and IBM and Rigetti and IonQ and elsewhere—but that virtually none of this involves D-Wave, whose devices remain interesting from various physics and engineering standpoints, but still fail to achieve any clear quantum speedups, just as the professional critics predicted? Is he upset that the brave system-builders who are racing finally to achieve quantum computational supremacy over the next year, are the ones who actually interacted with academic researchers (sorry: surly little trolls), and listened to what they said? Who understood, for example, why scaling up to 50+ qubits only made a lot of sense once you had one or two qubits that at least behaved well enough in isolation—which, after years of heroic effort, many of these system-builders now do?
How’d I do? Was there still too much argument there for the world of 2018?",2546,"['5e81a2dc26b3581434127769fa614d6bdb8998ca26de39d251c61265086f6df1', 'd6abf6ebcd8aeece6c0ce04210bedaa2f6797a04a2bbab2c2c3425308b6e09ad', '33a9a161f0d6a15edcbe2da566d772be930b26d7c88a3da8c101725093cd423b', 'c895179a3576fabe08725e0de796ecc7505e100c142b2a9abf73528776e910d6', '90dfc6616cb9f12ced901da89ec55e5b467e7b9795b4370de91c6d5d4d88c471', '08116c4ae87a601b2a7765656791d8a8b31c29deaa7f995f2a55188fe336fe0a', '642dce3f63f44ac403a9349eaf618e44699b8a1aa8d9afb7cea8f1b1b166739a', '1a4c1c2e32fa3a792ae6c8aa475da6c41d0c65d54dbcfe647f2808555e69ff8d', '9503a61f4ea6af8c52d36a810baeb5a65698bdd2ba3093268a798dbd723f226a', '2ef418d2352d9be8c767cdaa825f24dde2895e64abcdd2dc60bb1045a29c7159', 'c248f7b3e078613f0e547075940190ebc3d30343f272ce1199f665376274d033', '12c7e7cff5b5ee4a1f6bc520a9b324f808faddec35b3d51326420fd819a21488', 'cd778bf73be2d13d1a8edcc53dc3865f40ab400fc5d39b3f2f812c27dbab7a23', '1b6141f1a7aedb8c7b5b6422c903462d90fb7567a323b3569388dfdd78993b94', 'd61b609a84ccda6367562df86af126a3cdf7d9e7928e028e3f1f78bcb41da7f3', '7e71460b79440bcc14ebb663903932af269cc3832eeae2727e664efa15eb5fd9', 'd08211677c442e3bb58b9f7c2e0166fb32b8b1fceb76aeb3f84aabaa9fe4a232', 'ba29500195e4e04eb242a28706c75701311bfd3c430d9f69afbb7235edb2ecf7', '4ab067bf8e3ce8457caf68ff873beae2066dd02dda3afdddc1582df3bb527e4f', '91221800637876516a27b46675a0839b89197e22a8fefbb49b4b1a8cb6bce132', '8ba1fa6999d2415000de31cf4dfbc2496e48876bf9090e3c5bb2200c1ca4b7df', '412af6801ea9b21fba0a566b9d4611405823db19c9f3efa10b4cbae9f9565102', '3e6c8b738347973b0d724a649ca27083aafa3b7a4b09684202d6806e1e561501', 'f8e89b90ee591ad1aa0b75276265754a0fabe7001f6ac54ee095e967ecb343cd', '94e3c62fe783718e5cd4e1d03b5e791d9e0fcbd449f78dae92531a07b4e006c9', '95c0877a93d16a1e08c4b10f6371df1217060bdc178ec7d575f6abb6f00948e1', '5d9ff636934d42fd5a0b9e5e0bf067579ee5562e261fa09b5ee47a916f8802eb', 'd6a0c4f1d4499361b67adfca2c72e6d0a96575f7f2b683fee0ef193e9abbb248', '52a1305cdf2d2efd4632fd95b42e48b23774d10d0574233e7588de75dc471d98', 'b5b5c4dc05436b5bf057bb986bd61a6139e3e3586a121bade657f13250639209', 'ec17dada776b755af3296ed2a84f676c5ced1ef2e4fc03efc9f256fc2d7a7f44', 'cc2c3ce160038307ee891eb74131f3551cb7eae18df77f3d86fb70a2b5c63ce9', 'ecd13c237147bbd4bd5de43de3ddec14dbf45620bc9d45a3be4adc674382947a', 'cc80691a568180392ec75d73903fc5cd247f0d7bbc747717dd7eb41659450438', 'b5c65c55f10f774c17d77e3fd245bc2b64fb65e7cd1102d9e69b9b306b5bc088', '5a01de177f1b99ff4ca7ef544009d3bd68ab57191672c053e933c58c4b720842', '0a959e5f339fa8dafb0dafa1845d9e5752293f96dfd075e1ead28520f53c1523', '39034d8b26d8bc2e55d73e15e64bef0c94ef8f47a8524265aa09b4a05a093b8a', '6e0f79aa3b3d7c2430e487dad2b128da31fb24fee0bb59d5bac790892783a489', '8434cc17ab69741d4bc948280a051189e52bc405c35f610ad4737f573698b74f', '41d006d39e960ada845368614e91c66bd9d06b890c04c3e4fb13a0ccac31ccdd']"

The article is based on John’s keynote address at the recent “Q2B” (Quantum Computing for Business) conference, which I was unfortunately unable to attend. Here’s the abstract:
Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology will be available in the near future. Quantum computers with 50-100 qubits may be able to perform tasks which surpass the capabilities of today’s classical digital computers, but noise in quantum gates will limit the size of quantum circuits that can be executed reliably. NISQ devices will be useful tools for exploring many-body quantum physics, and may have other useful applications, but the 100-qubit quantum computer will not change the world right away — we should regard it as a significant step toward the more powerful quantum technologies of the future. Quantum technologists should continue to strive for more accurate quantum gates and, eventually, fully fault-tolerant quantum computing.

For regular Shtetl-Optimized readers, there’s unlikely to be much that’s new here: it’s basically 15 minutes of my usual spiel, packaged for mass consumption. But while it went over well with the live audience, right now the only comment on the video is—I quote—“uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,” from user “imbatman8472.” So if you feel so inclined, go over there, watch it, and try to start a more contentful discussion! Thanks so much to Andrés Goens, and everyone else in Dresden, for inviting me there and hosting a great visit.
(2) On December 4-6, there’s going to be a new conference in Mountain View, called Q2B (Quantum Computing for Business). There, if it interests you, you can hear about the embryonic QC industry, from some of the major players at Google, IBM, Microsoft, academia, and government, as well as some of the QC startups (like IonQ) that have blossomed over the last few years. Oh yes, and D-Wave. The keynote speaker will be John Preskill; Google’s John Martinis and IBM’s Jerry Chow will also be giving talks. I regret that another commitment will prevent me from attending myself, but I hope to attend next year’s iteration. (Full disclosure: I’m a scientific adviser to QC Ware, the firm that’s organizing the conference.)
(3) On October 24, the House Science Committee heard three hours of testimony—you can watch it all here—about the need for quantum information research and the danger of the US falling behind China. In what I believe is my first entry in the Congressional record, I’m quoted (for something totally incidental) at 1:09. John Preskill was mostly just delighted that the witness, Jim Kurose, referred to me as a “physicist.”
(4) For several years, people have been asking me whether Bitcoin is resistant against quantum attack. Now there’s finally an expert analysis, by Aggarwal et al., that looks into exactly that question. Two-sentence summary: the proof-of-work is probably fine, although Grover’s algorithm can of course be used against it, which might eventually necessitate adjusting the difficulty parameter to account for that, and/or migrating from a pure preimage search task to collision-finding, where my result with Yaoyun Shi showed that quantum computers offer “only” an n2/3 black-box speedup over classical computers, rather than a square-root speedup. The scheme for signing the transactions, which is currently based on elliptic curve cryptography, is the real danger point, but again one could address that by migrating to a post-quantum signature scheme. My main comment about the matter is that, if I’d invested in Bitcoin when I first learned about it, I’d be rich now.

We’re open to any theoretical aspects of quantum information, although if you wanted to work with me personally, then areas close to computer science would be the closest fit. I’m also able to supervise PhD students in physics, but am not directly involved with admissions to the physics department: this is a discussion we would have after you were already admitted to UT.
I, along with my theoretical computer science colleagues at UT Austin, am also open to outstanding students and postdocs in classical complexity theory. My wife, Dana Moshkovitz, tells me that she and David Zuckerman in particular are looking for a postdoc in the areas of pseudorandomness and derandomization (and for PhD students as well).
If you want to apply to the UTCS PhD program, please visit here. The deadline is December 15. If you specify that you want to work on quantum computing and information, and/or with me, then I’ll be sure to see your application. Emailing faculty at this stage doesn’t help; we won’t “estimate your chances” or even look at your qualifications until we can see all the applications together.
If you want to apply for a postdoc with me, here’s what to do:
- Email me introducing yourself (if I don’t already know you), and include your CV, your thesis (if you already have one), and up to 3 representative papers. Do this even if you already emailed me before.
- Arrange for two recommendation letters to be emailed to me.
Let’s set a deadline for postdoc applications of, I dunno, December 15?
In addition to the above, I’m happy to announce that the UT CS department is looking to hire a new faculty member in quantum computing and information—most likely a junior person. The UT physics department is also looking to hire quantum information faculty members, with a focus on a senior-level experimentalist right now. If you’re interested in these opportunities, just email me; I can put you in touch with the relevant people.
All in all, this is shaping up to be the most exciting era for quantum computing and information in Austin since a group of UT students, postdocs, and faculty including David Deutsch, John Wheeler, Wojciech Zurek, Bill Wootters, and Ben Schumacher laid much of the intellectual foundation of the field in the late 1970s and early 1980s. We hope you’ll join us. Hook ’em Hadamards!
Unrelated Announcements: Avi Wigderson has released a remarkable 368-page book, Mathematics and Computation, for free on the web. This document surveys pretty much the entire current scope of theoretical computer science, in a way only Avi, our field’s consummate generalist, could do. It also sets out Avi’s vision for the future and his sociological thoughts about TCS and its interactions with neighboring fields. I was a reviewer on the manuscript, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a panoramic view of TCS.
In other news, my UT friend and colleague Adam Klivans, and his student Surbhi Goel, have put out a preprint entitled Learning Depth-Three Neural Networks in Polynomial Time. (Beware: what the machine learning community calls “depth three,” is what the TCS community would call “depth two.”) This paper learns real-valued neural networks in the so-called p-concept model of Kearns and Schapire, and thereby evades a 2006 impossibility theorem of Klivans and Sherstov, which showed that efficiently learning depth-2 threshold circuits would require breaking cryptographic assumptions. More broadly, there’s been a surge of work in the past couple years on explaining the success of deep learning methods (methods whose most recent high-profile victory was, of course, AlphaGo Zero).

So, if you’re someone who came there wanting to ask me something, go ahead and ask in the comments of this post.
During my whirlwind tour of the Bay Area, questions started pouring in about a preprint from a group mostly at IBM Yorktown Heights, entitled Breaking the 49-Qubit Barrier in the Simulation of Quantum Circuits. In particular, does this paper make a mockery of everything the upcoming quantum supremacy experiments will try to achieve, and all the theorems about them that we’ve proved?
Following my usual practice, let me paste the abstract here, so that we have the authors’ words in front of us, rather than what a friend of a friend said a popular article reported might have been in the paper.
With the current rate of progress in quantum computing technologies, 50-qubit systems will soon become a reality. To assess, refine and advance the design and control of these devices, one needs a means to test and evaluate their fidelity. This in turn requires the capability of computing ideal quantum state amplitudes for devices of such sizes and larger. In this study, we present a new approach for this task that significantly extends the boundaries of what can be classically computed. We demonstrate our method by presenting results obtained from a calculation of the complete set of output amplitudes of a universal random circuit with depth 27 in a 2D lattice of 7 × 7 qubits. We further present results obtained by calculating an arbitrarily selected slice of 237 amplitudes of a universal random circuit with depth 23 in a 2D lattice of 8×7 qubits. Such calculations were previously thought to be impossible due to impracticable memory requirements. Using the methods presented in this paper, the above simulations required 4.5 and 3.0 TB of memory, respectively, to store calculations, which is well within the limits of existing classical computers.
This is an excellent paper, which sets a new record for the classical simulation of generic quantum circuits; I congratulate the authors for it. Now, though, I want you to take a deep breath and repeat after me:
This paper does not undercut the rationale for quantum supremacy experiments. The truth, ironically, is almost the opposite: it being possible to simulate 49-qubit circuits using a classical computer is a precondition for Google’s planned quantum supremacy experiment, because it’s the only way we know to check such an experiment’s results! The goal, with sampling-based quantum supremacy, was always to target the “sweet spot,” which we estimated at around 50 qubits, where classical simulation is still possible, but it’s clearly orders of magnitude more expensive than doing the experiment itself. If you like, the goal is to get as far as you can up the mountain of exponentiality, conditioned on people still being able to see you from the base. Why? Because you can. Because it’s there. Because it challenges those who think quantum computing will never scale: explain this, punks! But there’s no point unless you can verify the result.
Related to that, the paper does not refute any prediction I made, by doing anything I claimed was impossible. On the contrary (if you must know), the paper confirms something that I predicted would be possible. People said: “40 qubits is the practical limit of what you can simulate, so there’s no point in Google or anyone else doing a supremacy experiment with 49 qubits, since they can never verify the results.” I would shrug and say something like: “eh, if you can do 40 qubits, then I’m sure you can do 50. It’s only a thousand times harder!”
So, how does the paper get up to 50 qubits? A lot of computing power and a lot of clever tricks, one of which (the irony thickens…) came from a paper that I recently coauthored with Lijie Chen: Complexity-Theoretic Foundations of Quantum Supremacy Experiments. Lijie and I were interested in the question: what’s the best way to simulate a quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates? We noticed that there’s a time/space tradeoff here: you could just store the entire amplitude vector in memory and update, which would take exp(n) memory but also “only” about exp(n) time. Or you could compute the amplitudes you cared about via Feynman sums (as in the proof of BQP⊆PSPACE), which takes only linear memory, but exp(m) time. If you imagine, let’s say, n=50 and m=1000, then exp(n) might be practical if you’re IBM or Google, but exp(m) is certainly not.
So then we raised the question: could one get the best of both worlds? That is, could one simulate such a quantum circuit using both linear memory and exp(n) time? And we showed that this is almost possible: we gave an algorithm that uses linear memory and dO(n) time, where d is the circuit depth. Furthermore, the more memory it has available, the faster our algorithm will run—until, in the limit of exponential memory, it just becomes the “store the whole amplitude vector” algorithm mentioned above. I’m not sure why this algorithm wasn’t discovered earlier, especially since it basically just amounts to Savitch’s Theorem from complexity theory. In any case, though, the IBM group used this idea among others to take full advantage of the RAM it had available.
Let me make one final remark: this little episode perfectly illustrates why theoretical computer scientists like to talk about polynomial vs. exponential rather than specific numbers. If you keep your eyes on the asymptotic fundamentals, rather than every factor of 10 or 1000, then you’re not constantly shocked by events, like a dog turning its head for every passing squirrel. Before you could simulate 40 qubits, now you can simulate 50. Maybe with more cleverness you could get to 60 or even 70. But … dude. The problem is still exponential time.
We saw the same “SQUIRREL! SQUIRREL!” reaction with the people who claimed that the wonderful paper by Clifford and Clifford had undercut the rationale for BosonSampling experiments, by showing how to solve the problem in “merely” ~2n time rather than ~mn, where n is the number of photons and m is the number of modes. Of course, Arkhipov and I had never claimed more than ~2n hardness for the problem, and Clifford and Clifford’s important result had justified our conservatism on that point, but, y’know … SQUIRREL!
More broadly, it seems to me that this dynamic constantly occurs in the applied cryptography world. OMIGOD a 128-bit hash function has been broken! Big news! OMIGOD a new, harder hash function has been designed! Bigger news! OMIGOD OMIGOD OMIGOD the new one was broken too!! All of it fully predictable once you realize that we’re on the shores of an exponentially hard problem, and for some reason, refusing to go far enough out into the sea (i.e., pick large enough security parameters) that none of this back-and-forth would happen.
I apologize, sincerely, if I come off as too testy in this post. No doubt it’s entirely the fault of a cognitive defect on my end, wherein ten separate people asking me about something get treated by my brain like a single person who still doesn’t get it even after I’ve explained it ten times.",7342,"['7c101c9f3e19f89aad9a72b7f21fa48dbc363694500b95996748d7646a8b6df7', '72639ba4d64eae8836ffb50a1b7800e585243b5732d7219a0027c5e586be0b23',

119,3482,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3482,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2017-10-03,Scott Aaronson,Because you asked: the Simulation Hypothesis has not been falsified; remains unfalsifiable,"By email, by Twitter, even as the world was convulsed by tragedy, the inquiries poured in yesterday about a different topic entirely: Scott, did physicists really just prove that the universe is not a computer simulation—that we can’t be living in the Matrix?
What prompted this was a rash of popular articles like this one (“Researchers claim to have found proof we are NOT living in a simulation”). The articles were all spurred by a recent paper in Science Advances: Quantized gravitational responses, the sign problem, and quantum complexity, by Zohar Ringel of Hebrew University and Dmitry L. Kovrizhin of Oxford.
I’ll tell you what: before I comment, why don’t I just paste the paper’s abstract here. I invite you to read it—not the whole paper, just the abstract, but paying special attention to the sentences—and then make up your own mind about whether it supports the interpretation that all the popular articles put on it.
Ready? Set?
Abstract: It is believed that not all quantum systems can be simulated efficiently using classical computational resources. This notion is supported by the fact that it is not known how to express the partition function in a sign-free manner in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations for a large number of important problems. The answer to the question—whether there is a fundamental obstruction to such a sign-free representation in generic quantum systems—remains unclear. Focusing on systems with bosonic degrees of freedom, we show that quantized gravitational responses appear as obstructions to local sign-free QMC. In condensed matter physics settings, these responses, such as thermal Hall conductance, are associated with fractional quantum Hall effects. We show that similar arguments also hold in the case of spontaneously broken time-reversal (TR) symmetry such as in the chiral phase of a perturbed quantum Kagome antiferromagnet. The connection between quantized gravitational responses and the sign problem is also manifested in certain vertex models, where TR symmetry is preserved.
For those tuning in from home, the “sign problem” is an issue that arises when, for example, you’re trying to use the clever trick known as Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to learn about the ground state of a quantum system using a classical computer—but where you needed probabilities, which are real numbers from 0 to 1, your procedure instead spits out numbers some of which are negative, and which you can therefore no longer use to define a sensible sampling process. (In some sense, it’s no surprise that this would happen when you’re trying to simulate quantum mechanics, which of course is all about generalizing the rules of probability in a way that involves negative and even complex numbers! The surprise, rather, is that QMC lets you avoid the sign problem as often as it does.)
Anyway, this is all somewhat far from my expertise, but insofar as I understand the paper, it looks like a serious contribution to our understanding of the sign problem, and why local changes of basis can fail to get rid of it when QMC is used to simulate certain bosonic systems. It will surely interest QMC experts.
OK, but does any of this prove that the universe isn’t a computer simulation, as the popular articles claim (and as the original paper does not)?
It seems to me that, to get from here to there, you’d need to overcome four huge difficulties, any one of which would be fatal by itself, and which are logically independent of each other.
- As a computer scientist, one thing that leapt out at me, is that Ringel and Kovrizhin’s paper is fundamentally about computational complexity—specifically, about which quantum systems can and can’t be simulated in polynomial time on a classical computer—yet it’s entirely innocent of the language and tools of complexity theory. There’s no BQP, no QMA, no reduction-based hardness argument anywhere in sight, and no clearly-formulated request for one either. Instead, everything is phrased in terms of the failure of one specific algorithmic framework (namely QMC)—and within that framework, only “local” transformations of the physical degrees of freedom are considered, not nonlocal ones that could still be accessible to polynomial-time algorithms. Of course, one does whatever one needs to do to get a result.
To their credit, the authors do seem aware that a language for discussing all possible efficient algorithms exists. They write, for example, of a “common understanding related to computational complexity classes” that some quantum systems are hard to simulate, and specifically of the existence of systems that support universal quantum computation. So rather than criticize the authors for this limitation of their work, I view their paper as a welcome invitation for closer collaboration between the quantum complexity theory and quantum Monte Carlo communities, which approach many of the same questions from extremely different angles. As official ambassador between the two communities, I nominate Matt Hastings.
- OK, but even if the paper did address computational complexity head-on, about the most it could’ve said is that computer scientists generally believe that BPP≠BQP (i.e., that quantum computers can solve more decision problems in polynomial time than classical probabilistic ones); and that such separations are provable in the query complexity and communication complexity worlds; and that at any rate, quantum computers can solve exact sampling problems that are classically hard unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses (as pointed out in the BosonSampling paper, and independently by Bremner, Jozsa, Shepherd). Alas, until someone proves P≠PSPACE, there’s no hope for an unconditional proof that quantum computers can’t be efficiently simulated by classical ones.
(Incidentally, the paper comments, “Establishing an obstruction to a classical simulation is a rather ill-defined task.” I beg to differ: it’s not ill-defined; it’s just ridiculously hard!)
- OK, but suppose it were proved that BPP≠BQP—and for good measure, suppose it were also experimentally demonstrated that scalable quantum computing is possible in our universe. Even then, one still wouldn’t by any stretch have ruled out that the universe was a computer simulation! For as many of the people who emailed me asked themselves (but as the popular articles did not), why not just imagine that the universe is being simulated on a quantum computer? Like, duh?
- Finally: even if, for some reason, we disallowed using a quantum computer to simulate the universe, that still wouldn’t rule out the simulation hypothesis. For why couldn’t God, using Her classical computer, spend a trillion years to simulate one second as subjectively perceived by us? After all, what is exponential time to She for whom all eternity is but an eyeblink?
Anyway, if it weren’t for all four separate points above, then sure, physicists would have now proved that we don’t live in the Matrix.
I do have a few questions of my own, for anyone who came here looking for my reaction to the ‘news’: did you really need me to tell you all this? How much of it would you have figured out on your own, just by comparing the headlines of the popular articles to the descriptions (however garbled) of what was actually done? How obvious does something need to be, before it no longer requires an ‘expert’ to certify it as such? If I write 500 posts like this one, will the 501st post basically just write itself?
Asking for a friend.
Comment Policy: I welcome discussion about the Ringel-Dovrizhin paper; what might’ve gone wrong with its popularization; QMC; the sign problem; the computational complexity of condensed-matter problems more generally; and the relevance or irrelevance of work on these topics to broader questions about the simulability of the universe. But as a little experiment in blog moderation, I won’t allow comments that just philosophize in general about whether or not the universe is a simulation, without making further contact with the actual content of this post. We’ve already had the latter conversation here—probably, like, every week for the last decade—and I’m ready for something new.",8176,"['159003e82e18fb03dba551ec9da6ed36b975d63e77903a1b5080f54f1a3e0b92', '6f355b9addce9964d0f31d1803e306e48888a9bf53826448d34b93ed76240979', '8ecc30128e327a5a69ff44d5d89538ad45b2d21925d11c90b8cd14d69043e1d9', 'f89f2939ff5faeba16be635a26d71cce7e2932849b12c409dc2dc7a9947ee18d', '4bc834d4f6cc772d58dbf9fff63eff1955298f6b7bfb8f99b6867d24992d71f5', '65ede240d954b742bf467eedb124fb4fa4f37f2a9dba11a72d524e1e214f423b', '218f5a4056098cd3cc1709b9853016444da3ec6b509d9251646f5ffc2eb1fef7', 'a1f4ff6c7e215b5d9d2b2a15d2ebaf87c0ff7b70619f1463581c53b9a7d490f9', '19d01a87f9f07a2f8cade308fcfd00d542e5369456bb715e64a2010af08d6bce', '403b343910203c35674f8bd2c7d18d1af5f2f4646fc04946530bd8bfc82a8895', '5b6ebee5e0467e2b84e72da407975feaa48bdc80653a5339b6e36504e2a11f92', '88cf96912348987702c879f385906a1ce37149ab0237e9915ad2c2d7a5c4161e', 'b576869e092948fcfa0b8f663f474b88f83380cc36b40b72b678c86e419c355f', '8af56fd07607009af2622c4a116f60f740b71ff99d3e4d78e7be63fc0cc97bf5', '944e5da8fed070ff0637aacf5cec98555b2ccd597b2cf384c9b2ad5f07c56158', '7e4ffbaa7e85d5e8d46bbb35c397c741bd7f27014953ba71c8f8a5491d133352', '11899470f113296fae1b7a58220d124cb327e2c5e8cc05543569789a85e9b9a1', 'e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855', 'f6d47e04909db185aa13abb23da9eefd70b069cf4645350fe93073a3878546ca', 'c8d77718091726c0e9d91223d27eb9c4d98c1212e244ed1c1e9cb6a4090a3ce1', '322f5a034df793e4547c9b41c2e8f4d6d9f5a59a9916295f2cbb381f96fda21c', 'fd98205291b1fbea8b7940024a3893a5577b0ca96b17d3fccf1bb36339355aca', '823e67be5c1e3ca9c0c34ca33d7a7fd80f9ee0b9ee319c2e9d8f6f2865e97ea9', 'ea89de6e9c5c151e731fe5b0dd2c966ca921b52f57e60104a14c0ac165dfe9f3', 'bdf91360c588b6664c8ac9dc4515d4de6c14a0a6991cf21f1e6de3cde10a1e2e', '246e4b538a48187b690d0a4769d9308517232bc9f8b2408530f8cd1686c503fa', '24977cf979104d7c6779bb53ea6cce87a1226156d11df78bec7b82f0483b9691', 'b2ca5308c9457a7ff2846a62cb10c7c74af260bfe57d0dc2e561900cbd02f673', '7f02de972580def6f96acb6525e5ae00133760de1f85107fa96d82b7f2f10554', 'db8dc665b18a503abf5ed03bbefcc7fcca80654bd83c705c0b15b834f1d24669', '48543380be4738d7e43a6ad94f3b17084d58ae385540d8e823d0d2ef6c85dfd6', 'be1dccd6ea0db96dde0b3b762897e599267dbd9d1e85ac5729d909d7d66addda', 'ab7fcfd355710497d9fb901df6d2a1584d10eb52118f71d3707c82ed759f2592', '98908a802971accf5bd7df88487909bd5cbc03f8274b8d7304cef7aa0e965ac5', 'b89335a90b16c408f3a0161a7a7a1d89c37bbc5b531f5e82671d82b8eae0e2ae']"

First, the website haspvsnpbeensolved.com is now live! Thanks so much to my friend Adam Chalmers for setting it up. Please try it out on your favorite P vs. NP solution paper—I think you’ll be impressed by how well our secret validation algorithm performs.
Second, some readers might enjoy a YouTube video of me lecturing about the computability theory of closed timelike curves, from the Workshop on Computational Complexity and High Energy Physics at the University of Maryland a month ago. Other videos from the workshop—including of talks by John Preskill, Daniel Harlow, Stephen Jordan, and other names known around Shtetl-Optimized, and of a panel discussion in which I participated—are worth checking out as well. Thanks so much to Stephen for organizing such a great workshop!
Third, thanks to everyone who’s emailed to ask whether I’m holding up OK with Hurricane Harvey, and whether I know how to swim (I do). As it happens, I haven’t been in Texas for two months—I spent most of the summer visiting NYU and doing other travel, and this year, Dana and I are doing an early sabbatical at Tel Aviv University. However, I understand from friends that Austin, being several hours’ drive further inland, got nothing compared to what Houston did, and that UT is open on schedule for the fall semester. Hopefully our house is still standing as well! Our thoughts go to all those affected by the disaster in Houston. Eventually, the Earth’s rapidly destabilizing climate almost certainly means that Austin will be threatened as well by “500-year events” happening every year or two, as for that matter will a large portion of the earth’s surface. For now, though, Austin lives to be weird another day.
GapP, Oracles, and Quantum Supremacy
by Scott Aaronson
Stuart Kurtz 60th Birthday Conference, Columbia, South Carolina
August 20, 2017
It’s great to be here, to celebrate the life and work of Stuart Kurtz, which could never be … eclipsed … by anything.
I wanted to say something about work in structural complexity and counting complexity and oracles that Stuart was involved with “back in the day,” and how that work plays a major role in issues that concern us right now in quantum computing. A major goal for the next few years is the unfortunately-named Quantum Supremacy. What this means is to get a clear quantum speedup, for some task: not necessarily a useful task, but something that we can be as confident as possible is classically hard. For example, consider the 49-qubit superconducting chip that Google is planning to fabricate within the next year or so. This won’t yet be good enough for running Shor’s algorithm, to factor numbers of any interesting size, but it hopefully will be good enough to sample from a probability distribution over n-bit strings—in this case, 49-bit strings—that’s hard to sample from classically, taking somewhere on the order of 249 steps.
Furthermore, the evidence that that sort of thing is indeed classically hard, might actually be stronger than the evidence that factoring is classically hard. As I like to say, a fast classical factoring algorithm would “merely” collapse the world’s electronic commerce—as far as we know, it wouldn’t collapse the polynomial hierarchy! By contrast, a fast classical algorithm to simulate quantum sampling would collapse the polynomial hierarchy, assuming the simulation is exact. Let me first go over the argument for that, and then explain some of the more recent things we’ve learned.
#P is the class of all nonnegative integer functions f, for which there exists a nondeterministic polynomial-time Turing machine M such that f(x) equals the number of accepting paths of M(x). Less formally, #P is the class of problems that boil down to summing up an exponential number of nonnegative terms, each of which is efficiently computable individually.
GapP—introduced by Fenner, Fortnow, and Kurtz in 1992—can be defined as the set {f-g : f,g∈#P}; that is, the closure of #P under subtraction. Equivalently, GapP is the class of problems that boil down to summing up an exponential number of terms, each of which is efficiently computable individually, but which could be either positive or negative, and which can therefore cancel each other out. As you can see, GapP is a class that in some sense anticipates quantum computing!
For our purposes, the most important difference between #P and GapP is that #P functions can at least be multiplicatively approximated in the class BPPNP, by using Stockmeyer’s technique of approximating counting with universal hash functions. By contrast, even if you just want to approximate a GapP function to within (say) a factor of 2—or for that matter, just decide whether a GapP function is positive or negative—it’s not hard to see that that’s already a #P-hard problem. For, supposing we had an oracle to solve this problem, we could then shift the sum this way and that by adding positive and negative dummy terms, and use binary search, to zero in on the sum’s exact value in polynomial time.
It’s also not hard to see that a quantum computation can encode an arbitrary GapP function in one of its amplitudes. Indeed, let s:{0,1}n→{1,-1} be any Boolean function that’s given by a polynomial-size circuit. Then consider the quantum circuit below.
When we run this circuit, the probability that we see the all-0 string as output is
$$ \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{z\in \{0,1\}^n} s(z) \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{z,w\in \{0,1\}^n} s(z) s(w) $$
which is clearly in GapP, and clearly #P-hard even to approximate to within a multiplicative factor.
By contrast, suppose we had a probabilistic polynomial-time classical algorithm, call it M, to sample the output distribution of the above quantum circuit. Then we could rewrite the above probability as Prr[M(r) outputs 0…0], where r consists of the classical random bits used by M. This is again an exponentially large sum, with one term for each possible r value—but now it’s a sum of nonnegative terms (probabilities), which is therefore approximable in BPPNP.
We can state the upshot as follows. Let ExactSampBPP be the class of sampling problems—that is, families of probability distributions {Dx}x, one for each input x∈{0,1}n—for which there exists a polynomial-time randomized algorithm that outputs a sample exactly from Dx, in time polynomial in |x|. Let ExactSampBQP be the same thing except that we allow a polynomial-time quantum algorithm. Then we have that, if ExactSampBPP = ExactSampBQP, then squared sums of both positive and negative terms, could efficiently be rewritten as sums of nonnegative terms only—and hence P#P=BPPNP. This, in turn, would collapse the polynomial hierarchy to the third level, by Toda’s Theorem that PH⊆P#P, together with the result BPPNP⊆∑3. To summarize:
Theorem 1. Quantum computers can efficiently solve exact sampling problems that are classically hard unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.
(In fact, the argument works not only if the classical algorithm exactly samples Dx, but if it samples from any distribution in which the probabilities are multiplicatively close to Dx‘s. If we really only care about exact sampling, then we can strengthen the conclusion to get that PH collapses to the second level.)
This sort of reasoning was implicit in several early works, including those of Fenner et al. and Terhal and DiVincenzo. It was made fully explicit in my paper with Alex Arkhipov on BosonSampling in 2011, and in the independent work of Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd on the IQP model. These works actually showed something stronger, which is that we get a collapse of PH, not merely from a fast classical algorithm to simulate arbitrary quantum systems, but from fast classical algorithms to simulate various special quantum systems. In the case of BosonSampling, that special system is a collection of identical, non-interacting photons passing through a network of beamsplitters, then being measured at the very end to count the number of photons in each mode. In the case of IQP, the special system is a collection of qubits that are prepared, subjected to some commuting Hamiltonians acting on various subsets of the qubits, and then measured. These special systems don’t seem to be capable of universal quantum computation (or for that matter, even universal classical computation!)—and correspondingly, many of them seem easier to realize in the lab than a full universal quantum computer.
From an experimental standpoint, though, all these results are unsatisfactory, because they all talk only about the classical hardness of exact (or very nearly exact) sampling—and indeed, the arguments are based around the hardness of estimating just a single, exponentially-small amplitude. But any real experiment will have tons of noise and inaccuracy, so it seems only fair to let the classical simulation be subject to serious noise and inaccuracy as well—but as soon as we do, the previous argument collapses.
Thus, from the very beginning, Alex Arkhipov and I took it as our “real” goal to show, under some reasonable assumption, that there’s a distribution D that a polynomial-time quantum algorithm can sample from, but such that no polynomial-time classical algorithm can sample from any distribution that’s even ε-close to D in variation distance. Indeed, this goal is what led us to BosonSampling in the first place: we knew that we needed amplitudes that were not only #P-hard but “robustly” #P-hard; we knew that the permanent of an n×n matrix (at least over finite fields) was the canonical example of a “robustly” #P-hard function; and finally, we knew that systems of identical non-interacting bosons, such as photons, gave rise to amplitudes that were permanents in an extremely natural way. The fact that photons actually exist in the physical world, and that our friends with quantum optics labs like to do experiments with them, was just a nice bonus!
A bit more formally, let ApproxSampBPP be the class of sampling problems for which there exists a classical algorithm that, given an input x∈{0,1}n and a parameter ε>0, samples a distribution that’s at most away from Dx in variation distance, in time polynomial in n and 1/ε. Let ApproxSampBQP be the same except that we allow a quantum algorithm. Then the “dream” result that we’d love to prove—both then and now—is the following.
Strong Quantum Supremacy Conjecture. If ApproxSampBPP = ApproxSampBQP, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses.
Unfortunately, Alex and I were only able to prove this conjecture assuming a further hypothesis, about the permanents of i.i.d. Gaussian matrices.
Theorem 2 (A.-Arkhipov). Given an n×n matrix X of independent complex Gaussian entries, each of mean 0 and variance 1, assume it’s a #P-hard problem to approximate |Per(X)|2 to within ±ε⋅n!, with probability at least 1-δ over the choice of X, in time polynomial in n, 1/ε, and 1/δ. Then the Strong Quantum Supremacy Conjecture holds. Indeed, more than that: in such a case, even a fast approximate classical simulation of BosonSampling, in particular, would imply P#P=BPPNP and hence a collapse of PH.
Alas, after some months of effort, we were unable to prove the needed #P-hardness result for Gaussian permanents, and it remains an outstanding open problem—there’s not even a consensus as to whether it should be true or false. Note that there is a famous polynomial-time classical algorithm to approximate the permanents of nonnegative matrices, due to Jerrum, Sinclair, and Vigoda, but that algorithm breaks down for matrices with negative or complex entries. This is once again the power of cancellations, the difference between #P and GapP.
Frustratingly, if we want the exact permanents of i.i.d. Gaussian matrices, we were able to prove that that’s #P-hard; and if we want the approximate permanents of arbitrary matrices, we also know that that’s #P-hard—it’s only when we have approximation and random inputs in the same problem that we no longer have the tools to prove #P-hardness.
In the meantime, one can also ask a meta-question. How hard should it be to prove the Strong Quantum Supremacy Conjecture? Were we right to look at slightly exotic objects, like the permanents of Gaussian matrices? Or could Strong Quantum Supremacy have a “pure, abstract complexity theory proof”?
Well, one way to formalize that question is to ask whether Strong Quantum Supremacy has a relativizing proof, a proof that holds in the presence of an arbitrary oracle. Alex and I explicitly raised that as an open problem in our BosonSampling paper.
Note that “weak” quantum supremacy—i.e., the statement that ExactSampBPP = ExactSampBQP collapses the polynomial hierarchy—has a relativizing proof, namely the proof that I sketched earlier. All the ingredients that we used—Toda’s Theorem, Stockmeyer approximate counting, simple manipulations of quantum circuits—were relativizing ingredients. By contrast, all the way back in 1998, Fortnow and Rogers proved the following.
Theorem 3 (Fortnow and Rogers). There exists an oracle relative to which P=BQP and yet PH is infinite.
In other words, if you want to prove that P=BQP collapses the polynomial hierarchy, the proof can’t be relativizing. This theorem was subsequently generalized in a paper by Fenner, Fortnow, Kurtz, and Li, which used concepts like “generic oracles” that seem powerful but that I don’t understand.
The trouble is, Fortnow and Rogers’s construction was extremely tailored to making P=BQP. It didn’t even make PromiseBPP=PromiseBQP (that is, it allowed that quantum computers might still be stronger than classical ones for promise problems), let alone did it collapse quantum with classical for sampling problems.
We can organize the various quantum/classical collapse possibilities as follows:
ExactSampBPP = ExactSampBQP
⇓
ApproxSampBPP = ApproxSampBQP ⇔ FBPP = FBQP
⇓
PromiseBPP = PromiseBQP
⇓
BPP = BQP
Here FBPP is the class of relation problems solvable in randomized polynomial time—that is, problems where given an input x∈{0,1}n and a parameter ε>0, the goal is to produce any output in a certain set Sx, with success probability at least 1-ε, in time polynomial in n and 1/ε. FBQP is the same thing except for quantum polynomial time.
The equivalence between the two equalities ApproxSampBPP = ApproxSampBQP and FBPP=FBQP is not obvious, and was the main result in my 2011 paper The Equivalence of Sampling and Searching. While it’s easy to see that ApproxSampBPP = ApproxSampBQP implies FBPP=FBQP, the opposite direction requires us to take an arbitrary sampling problem S, and define a relation problem RS that has “essentially the same difficulty” as S (in the sense that RS has an efficient classical algorithm iff S does, RS has an efficient quantum algorithm iff S does, etc). This, in turn, we do using Kolmogorov complexity: basically, RS asks us to output a tuple of samples that have large probabilities according to the requisite probability distribution from the sampling problem; and that also, conditioned on that, are close to algorithmically random. The key observation is that, if a probabilistic Turing machine of fixed size can solve that relation problem for arbitrarily large inputs, then it must be doing so by sampling from a probability distribution close in variation distance to D—since any other approach would lead to outputs that were algorithmically compressible.
Be that as it may, staring at the chain of implications above, a natural question is which equalities in the chain collapse the polynomial hierarchy in a relativizing way, and which equalities collapse PH (if they do) only for deeper, non-relativizing reasons.
This is one of the questions that Lijie Chen and I took up, and settled, in our paper Complexity-Theoretic Foundations of Quantum Supremacy Experiments, which was presented at this summer’s Computational Complexity Conference (CCC) in Riga. The “main” results in our paper—or at least, the results that the physicists care about—were about how confident we can be in the classical hardness of simulating quantum sampling experiments with random circuits, such as the experiments that the Google group will hopefully be able to do with its 49-qubit device in the near future. This involved coming up with a new hardness assumption, which was tailored to those sorts of experiments, and giving a reduction from that new assumption, and studying how far existing algorithms come toward breaking the new assumption (tl;dr: not very far).
But our paper also had what I think of as a “back end,” containing results mainly of interest to complexity theorists, about what kinds of quantum supremacy theorems we can and can’t hope for in principle. When I’m giving talks about our paper to physicists, I never have time to get to this back end—it’s always just “blah, blah, we also did some stuff involving structural complexity and oracles.” But given that a large fraction of all the people on earth who enjoy those things are probably right here in this room, in the rest of this talk, I’d like to tell you about what was in the back end.
The first thing there was the following result.
Theorem 4 (A.-Chen). There exists an oracle relative to which ApproxSampBPP = ApproxSampBQP and yet PH is infinite. In other words, any proof of the Strong Quantum Supremacy Conjecture will require non-relativizing techniques.
Theorem 4 represents a substantial generalization of Fortnow and Rogers’s Theorem 3, in that it makes quantum and classical equivalent not only for promise problems, but even for approximate sampling problems. There’s also a sense in which Theorem 4 is the best possible: as we already saw, there are no oracles relative to which ExactSampBPP = ExactSampBQP and yet PH is infinite, because the opposite conclusion relativizes.
So how did we prove Theorem 4? Well, we learned at this workshop that Stuart Kurtz pioneered the development of principled ways to prove oracle results just like this one, with multiple “nearly conflicting” requirements. But, because we didn’t know that at the time, we basically just plunged in and built the oracle we wanted by hand!
In more detail, you can think of our oracle construction as proceeding in three steps.
- We throw in an oracle for a PSPACE-complete problem. This collapses ApproxSampBPP with ApproxSampBQP, which is what we want. Unfortunately, it also collapses the polynomial hierarchy down to P, which is not what we want!
- So then we need to add in a second part of the oracle that makes PH infinite again. From Håstad’s seminal work in the 1980s until recently, even if we just wanted any oracle that makes PH infinite, without doing anything else at the same time, we only knew how to achieve that with quite special oracles. But in their 2015 breakthrough, Rossman, Servedio, and Tan have shown that even a random oracle makes PH infinite with probability 1. So for simplicity, we might as well take this second part of the oracle to be random. The “only” problem is that, along with making PH infinite, a random oracle will also re-separate ApproxSampBPP and ApproxSampBQP (and for that matter, even ExactSampBPP and ExactSampBQP)—for example, because of the Fourier sampling task performed by the quantum circuit I showed you earlier! So we once again seem back where we started.
(To ward off confusion: ever since Fortnow and Rogers posed the problem in 1998, it remains frustratingly open whether BPP and BQP can be separated by a random oracle—that’s a problem that I and others have worked on, making partial progress that makes a query complexity separation look unlikely without definitively ruling one out. But separating the sampling versions of BPP and BQP by a random oracle is much, much easier.)
- So, finally, we need to take the random oracle that makes PH infinite, and “scatter its bits around randomly” in such a way that a PH machine can still find the bits, but an ApproxSampBQP machine can’t. In other words: given our initial random oracle A, we can make a new oracle B such that B(y,r)=(1,A(y)) if r is equal to a single randomly-chosen “password” ry, depending on the query y, and B(y,r)=(0,0) otherwise. In that case, it takes just one more existential quantifier to guess the password ry, so PH can do it, but a quantum algorithm is stuck, basically because the linearity of quantum mechanics makes the algorithm not very sensitive to tiny random changes to the oracle string (i.e., the same reason why Grover’s algorithm can’t be arbitrarily sped up). Incidentally, the reason why the password ry needs to depend on the query y is that otherwise the input x to the quantum algorithm could hardcode a password, and thereby reveal exponentially many bits of the random oracle A.
We should now check: why does the above oracle “only” collapse ApproxSampBPP and ApproxSampBQP? Why doesn’t it also collapse ExactSampBPP and ExactSampBQP—as we know that it can’t, by our previous argument? The answer is: because a quantum algorithm does have an exponentially small probability of correctly guessing a given password ry. And that’s enough to make the distribution sampled by the quantum algorithm differ, by 1/exp(n) in variation distance, from the distribution sampled by any efficient classical simulation of the algorithm—an error that doesn’t matter for approximate sampling, but does matter for exact sampling.
Anyway, it’s then just like seven pages of formalizing the above intuitions and you’re done!
OK, since there seems to be time, I’d like to tell you about one more result from the back end of my and Lijie’s paper.
If we can work relative to whatever oracle A we like, then it’s easy to get quantum supremacy, and indeed BPPA≠BQPA. We can, for example, use Simon’s problem, or Shor’s period-finding problem, or Forrelation, or other choices of black-box problems that admit huge, provable quantum speedups. In the unrelativized world, by contrast, it’s clear that we have to make some complexity assumption for quantum supremacy—even if we just want ExactSampBPP ≠ ExactSampBQP. For if (say) P=P#P, then ExactSampBPP and ExactSampBQP would collapse as well.
Lijie and I were wondering: what happens if we try to “interpolate” between the relativized and unrelativized worlds? More specifically, what happens if our algorithms are allowed to query a black box, but we’re promised that whatever’s inside the black box is efficiently computable (i.e., has a small circuit)? How hard is it to separate BPP from BQP, or ApproxSampBPP from ApproxSampBQP, relative to an oracle A that’s constrained to lie in P/poly?
Theorem 5. Suppose there exist cryptographic one-way functions (even just against classical adversaries). Then there exists an oracle A∈P/poly such that BPPA≠BQPA.
While we still need to make a computational hardness assumption here, to separate quantum from classical computing, the surprise is that the assumption is so much weaker than what we’re used to. We don’t need to assume the hardness of factoring or discrete log—or for that matter, of any “structured” problem that could be a basis for, e.g., public-key cryptography. Just a one-way function that’s hard to invert, that’s all!
The intuition here is really simple. Suppose there’s a one-way function; then it’s well-known, by the HILL and GGM Theorems of classical cryptography, that we can bootstrap it to get a cryptographic pseudorandom function family. This is a family of polynomial-time computable functions fs:{0,1}n→{0,1}n, parameterized by a secret seed s, such that fs can’t be distinguished from a truly random function f by any polynomial-time algorithm that’s given oracle access to the function and that doesn’t know s. Then, as our efficiently computable oracle A that separates quantum from classical computing, we take an ensemble of functions like
gs,r(x) = fs(x mod r),
where r is an exponentially large integer that serves as a “hidden period,” and s and r are both secrets stored by the oracle that are inaccessible to the algorithm that queries it.
The reasoning is now as follows: certainly there’s an efficient quantum algorithm to find r, or to solve some decision problem involving r, which we can use to define a language that’s in BQPA but not in BPPA. That algorithm is just Shor’s period-finding algorithm! (Technically, Shor’s algorithm needs certain assumptions on the starting function fs to work—e.g., it couldn’t be a constant function—but if those assumptions aren’t satisfied, then fs wasn’t pseudorandom anyway.) On the other hand, suppose there were an efficient classical algorithm to find the period r. In that case, we have a dilemma on our hands: would the classical algorithm still have worked, had we replaced fs by a truly random function? If so, then the classical algorithm would violate well-known lower bounds on the classical query complexity of period-finding. But if not, then by working on pseudorandom functions but not on truly random functions, the algorithm would be distinguishing the two—so fs wouldn’t have been a cryptographic pseudorandom function at all, contrary to assumption!
This all caused Lijie and me to wonder whether Theorem 5 could be strengthened even further, so that it wouldn’t use any complexity assumption at all. In other words, why couldn’t we just prove unconditionally that there’s an oracle A∈P/poly such that BPPA≠BQPA? By comparison, it’s not hard to see that we can unconditionally construct an oracle A∈P/poly such that PA≠NPA.
Alas, with the following theorem, we were able to explain why BPP vs. BQP (and even ApproxSampBPP vs. ApproxSampBQP) are different, and why some computational assumption is still needed to separate quantum from classical, even if we’re working relative to an efficiently computable oracle.
Theorem 6 (A.-Chen). Suppose that, in the real world, ApproxSampBPP = ApproxSampBQP and NP⊆BPP (granted, these are big assumptions!). Then ApproxSampBPPA = ApproxSampBQPA for all oracles A∈P/poly.
Taking the contrapositive, this is saying that you can’t separate ApproxSampBPP from ApproxSampBQP relative to an efficiently computable oracle, without separating some complexity classes in the real world. This contrasts not only with P vs. NP, but even with ExactSampBPP vs. ExactSampBQP, which can be separated unconditionally relative to efficiently computable oracles.
The proof of Theorem 6 is intuitive and appealing. Not surprisingly, we’re going to heavily exploit the assumptions ApproxSampBPP = ApproxSampBQP and NP⊆BPP. Let Q be a polynomial-time quantum algorithm that queries an oracle A∈P/poly. Then we need to simulate Q—and in particular, sample close to the same probability distribution over outputs—using a polynomial-time classical algorithm that queries A.
Let
$$ \sum_{x,w} \alpha_{x,w} \left|x,w\right\rangle $$
be the state of Q immediately before its first query to the oracle A, where x is the input to be submitted to the oracle. Then our first task is to get a bunch of samples from the probability distribution D={|αx,w|2}x,w, or something close to D in variation distance. But this is easy to do, using the assumption ApproxSampBPP = ApproxSampBQP.
Let x1,…,xk be our samples from D, marginalized to the x part. Then next, our classical algorithm queries A on each of x1,…,xk, getting responses A(x1),…,A(xk). The next step is to search for a function f∈P/poly—or more specifically, a function of whatever fixed polynomial size is relevant—that agrees with A on the sample data, i.e. such that f(xi)=A(xi) for all i∈[k]. This is where we’ll use the assumption NP⊆BPP (together, of course, with the fact that at least one such f exists, namely A itself!), to make the task of finding f efficient. We’ll also appeal to a fundamental fact about the sample complexity of PAC-learning. The fact is that, if we find a polynomial-size circuit f that agrees with A on a bunch of sample points drawn independently from a distribution, then f will probably agree with A on most further points drawn from the same distribution as well.
So, OK, we then have a pretty good “mock oracle,” f, that we can substitute for the real oracle on the first query that Q makes. Of course f and A won’t perfectly agree, but the small fraction of disagreements won’t matter much, again because of the linearity of quantum mechanics (i.e., the same thing that prevents us from speeding up Grover’s algorithm arbitrarily). So we can basically simulate Q’s first query, and now our classical simulation is good to go until Q’s second query! But now you can see where this is going: we iterate the same approach, and reuse the same assumptions ApproxSampBPP = ApproxSampBQP and NP⊆BPP, to find a new “mock oracle” that lets us simulate Q’s second query, and so on until all of Q’s queries have been simulated.
OK, I’ll stop there. I don’t have a clever conclusion or anything.

This slogan seems to have originated around 1991 with Rolf Landauer. It’s ricocheted around quantum information for the entire time I’ve been in the field, incanted in funding agency reports and popular articles and at the beginnings and ends of talks.
But what the hell does it mean?
There are many things it’s taken to mean, in my experience, that don’t make a lot of sense when you think about them—or else they’re vacuously true, or purely a matter of perspective, or not faithful readings of the slogan’s words.
For example, some people seem to use the slogan to mean something more like its converse: “physics is informational.” That is, the laws of physics are ultimately not about mass or energy or pressure, but about bits and computations on them. As I’ve often said, my problem with that view is less its audacity than its timidity! It’s like, what would the universe have to do in order not to be informational in this sense? “Information” is just a name we give to whatever picks out one element from a set of possibilities, with the “amount” of information given by the log of the set’s cardinality (and with suitable generalizations to infinite sets, nonuniform probability distributions, yadda yadda). So, as long as the laws of physics take the form of telling us that some observations or configurations of the world are possible and others are not, or of giving us probabilities for each configuration, no duh they’re about information!
Other people use “information is physical” to pour scorn on the idea that “information” could mean anything without some actual physical instantiation of the abstract 0’s and 1’s, such as voltage differences in a loop of wire. Here I certainly agree with the tautology that in order to exist physically—that is, be embodied in the physical world—a piece of information (like a song, video, or computer program) does need to be embodied in the physical world. But my inner Platonist slumps in his armchair when people go on to assert that, for example, it’s meaningless to discuss the first prime number larger than 1010^125, because according to post-1998 cosmology, one couldn’t fit its digits inside the observable universe.
If the cosmologists revise their models next week, will this prime suddenly burst into existence, with all the mathematical properties that one could’ve predicted for it on general grounds—only to fade back into the netherworld if the cosmologists revise their models again? Why would anyone want to use language in such a tortured way?
Yes, brains, computers, yellow books, and so on that encode mathematical knowledge comprise only a tiny sliver of the physical world. But it’s equally true that the physical world we observe comprises only a tiny sliver of mathematical possibility-space.
Still other people use “information is physical” simply to express their enthusiasm for the modern merger of physical and information sciences, as exemplified by quantum computing. Far be it from me to temper that enthusiasm: rock on, dudes!
Yet others use “information is physical” to mean that the rules governing information processing and transmission in the physical world aren’t knowable a priori, but can only be learned from physics. This is clearest in the case of quantum information, which has its own internal logic that generalizes the logic of classical information. But in some sense, we didn’t need quantum mechanics to tell us this! Of course the laws of physics have ultimate jurisdiction over whatever occurs in the physical world, information processing included.
My biggest beef, with all these unpackings of the “information is physical” slogan, is that none of them really engage with any of the deep truths that we’ve learned about physics. That is, we could’ve had more-or-less the same debates about any of them, even in a hypothetical world where the laws of physics were completely different.
So then what should we mean by “information is physical”? In the rest of this post, I’d like to propose an answer to that question.
We get closer to the meat of the slogan if we consider some actual physical phenomena, say in quantum mechanics. The double-slit experiment will do fine.
Recall: you shoot photons, one by one, at a screen with two slits, then examine the probability distribution over where the photons end up on a second screen. You ask: does that distribution contain alternating “light” and “dark” regions, the signature of interference between positive and negative amplitudes? And the answer, predicted by the math and confirmed by experiment, is: yes, but only if the information about which slit the photon went through failed to get recorded anywhere else in the universe, other than the photon location itself.
Here a skeptic interjects: but that has to be wrong! The criterion for where a physical particle lands on a physical screen can’t possibly depend on anything as airy as whether “information” got “recorded” or not. For what counts as “information,” anyway? As an extreme example: what if God, unbeknownst to us mortals, took divine note of which slit the photon went through? Would that destroy the interference pattern? If so, then every time we do the experiment, are we collecting data about the existence or nonexistence of an all-knowing God?
It seems to me that the answer is: insofar as the mind of God can be modeled as a tensor factor in Hilbert space, yes, we are. And crucially, if quantum mechanics is universally true, then the mind of God would have to be such a tensor factor, in order for its state to play any role in the prediction of observed phenomena.
To say this another way: it’s obvious and unexceptionable that, by observing a physical system, you can often learn something about what information must be in it. For example, you need never have heard of DNA to deduce that chickens must somehow contain information about making more chickens. What’s much more surprising is that, in quantum mechanics, you can often deduce things about what information can’t be present, anywhere in the physical world—because if such information existed, even a billion light-years away, it would necessarily have a physical effect that you don’t see.
Another famous example here concerns identical particles. You may have heard the slogan that “if you’ve seen one electron, you’ve seen them all”: that is, apart from position, momentum, and spin, every two electrons have exactly the same mass, same charge, same every other property, including even any properties yet to be discovered. Again the skeptic interjects: but that has to be wrong. Logically, you could only ever confirm that two electrons were different, by observing a difference in their behavior. Even if the electrons had behaved identically for a billion years, you couldn’t rule out the possibility that they were actually different, for example because of tiny nametags (“Hi, I’m Emily the Electron!” “Hi, I’m Ernie!”) that had no effect on any experiment you’d thought to perform, but were visible to God.
You can probably guess where this is going. Quantum mechanics says that, no, you can verify that two particles are perfectly identical by doing an experiment where you swap them and see what happens. If the particles are identical in all respects, then you’ll see quantum interference between the swapped and un-swapped states. If they aren’t, you won’t. The kind of interference you’ll see is different for fermions (like electrons) than for bosons (like photons), but the basic principle is the same in both cases. Once again, quantum mechanics lets you verify that a specific type of information—in this case, information that distinguishes one particle from another—was not present anywhere in the physical world, because if it were, it would’ve destroyed an interference effect that you in fact saw.
This, I think, already provides a meatier sense in which “information is physical” than any of the senses discussed previously.
But we haven’t gotten to the filet mignon yet. The late, great Jacob Bekenstein will forever be associated with the discovery that information, wherever and whenever it occurs in the physical world, takes up a minimum amount of space. The most precise form of this statement, called the covariant entropy bound, was worked out in detail by Raphael Bousso. Here I’ll be discussing a looser version of the bound, which holds in “non-pathological” cases, and which states that a bounded physical system can store at most A/(4 ln 2) bits of information, where A is the area in Planck units of any surface that encloses the system—so, about 1069 bits per square meter. (Actually it’s 1069 qubits per square meter, but because of Holevo’s theorem, an upper bound on the number of qubits is also an upper bound on the number of classical bits that can be reliably stored in a system and then retrieved later.)
You might have heard of the famous way Nature enforces this bound. Namely, if you tried to create a hard drive that stored more than 1069 bits per square meter of surface area, the hard drive would necessarily collapse to a black hole. And from that point on, the information storage capacity would scale “only” with the area of the black hole’s event horizon—a black hole itself being the densest possible hard drive allowed by physics.
Let’s hear once more from our skeptic. “Nonsense! Matter can take up space. Energy can take up space. But information? Bah! That’s just a category mistake. For a proof, suppose God took one of your black holes, with a 1-square-meter event horizon, which already had its supposed maximum of ~1069 bits of information. And suppose She then created a bunch of new fundamental fields, which didn’t interact with gravity, electromagnetism, or any of the other fields that we know from observation, but which had the effect of encoding 10300 new bits in the region of the black hole. Presto! An unlimited amount of additional information, exactly where Bekenstein said it couldn’t exist.”
We’d like to pinpoint what’s wrong with the skeptic’s argument—and do so in a self-contained, non-question-begging way, a way that doesn’t pull any rabbits out of hats, other than the general principles of relativity and quantum mechanics. I was confused myself about how to do this, until a month ago, when Daniel Harlow helped set me straight (any remaining howlers in my exposition are 100% mine, not his).
I believe the logic goes like this:
- Relativity—even just Galilean relativity—demands that, in flat space, the laws of physics must have the same form for all inertial observers (i.e., all observers who move through space at constant speed).
- Anything in the physical world that varies in space—say, a field that encodes different bits of information at different locations—also varies in time, from the perspective of an observer who moves through the field at a constant speed.
- Combining 1 and 2, we conclude that anything that can vary in space can also vary in time. Or to say it better, there’s only one kind of varying: varying in spacetime.
- More strongly, special relativity tells us that there’s a specific numerical conversion factor between units of space and units of time: namely the speed of light, c. Loosely speaking, this means that if we know the rate at which a field varies across space, we can also calculate the rate at which it varies across time, and vice versa.
- Anything that varies across time carries energy. Why? Because this is essentially the definition of energy in quantum mechanics! Up to a constant multiple (namely, Planck’s constant), energy is the expected speed of rotation of the global phase of the wavefunction, when you apply your Hamiltonian. If the global phase rotates at the slowest possible speed, then we take the energy to be zero, and say you’re in a vacuum state. If it rotates at the next highest speed, we say you’re in a first excited state, and so on. Indeed, assuming a time-independent Hamiltonian, the evolution of any quantum system can be fully described by simply decomposing the wavefunction into a superposition of energy eigenstates, then tracking of the phase of each eigenstate’s amplitude as it loops around and around the unit circle. No energy means no looping around means nothing ever changes.
- Combining 3 and 5, any field that varies across space carries energy.
- More strongly, combining 4 and 5, if we know how quickly a field varies across space, we can lower-bound how much energy it has to contain.
- In general relativity, anything that carries energy couples to the gravitational field. This means that anything that carries energy necessarily has an observable effect: if nothing else, its effect on the warping of spacetime. (This is dramatically illustrated by dark matter, which is currently observable via its spacetime warping effect and nothing else.)
- Combining 6 and 8, any field that varies across space couples to the gravitational field.
- More strongly, combining 7 and 8, if we know how quickly a field varies across space, then we can lower-bound by how much it has to warp spacetime. This is so because of another famous (and distinctive) feature of gravity: namely, the fact that it’s universally attractive, so all the warping contributions add up.
- But in GR, spacetime can only be warped by so much before we create a black hole: this is the famous Schwarzschild bound.
- Combining 10 and 11, the information contained in a physical field can only vary so quickly across space, before it causes spacetime to collapse to a black hole.
Summarizing where we’ve gotten, we could say: any information that’s spatially localized at all, can only be localized so precisely. In our world, the more densely you try to pack 1’s and 0’s, the more energy you need, therefore the more you warp spacetime, until all you’ve gotten for your trouble is a black hole. Furthermore, if we rewrote the above conceptual argument in math—keeping track of all the G’s, c’s, h’s, and so on—we could derive a quantitative bound on how much information there can be in a bounded region of space. And if we were careful enough, that bound would be precisely the holographic entropy bound, which says that the number of (qu)bits is at most A/(4 ln 2), where A is the area of a bounding surface in Planck units.
Let’s pause to point out some interesting features of this argument.
Firstly, we pretty much needed the whole kitchen sink of basic physical principles: special relativity (both the equivalence of inertial frames and the finiteness of the speed of light), quantum mechanics (in the form of the universal relation between energy and frequency), and finally general relativity and gravity. All three of the fundamental constants G, c, and h made appearances, which is why all three show up in the detailed statement of the holographic bound.
But secondly, gravity only appeared from step 8 onwards. Up till then, everything could be said solely in the language of quantum field theory: that is, quantum mechanics plus special relativity. The result would be the so-called Bekenstein bound, which upper-bounds the number of bits in any spatial region by the product of the region’s radius and its energy content. I learned that there’s an interesting history here: Bekenstein originally deduced this bound using ingenious thought experiments involving black holes. Only later did people realize that the Bekenstein bound can be derived purely within QFT (see here and here for example)—in contrast to the holographic bound, which really is a statement about quantum gravity. (An early hint of this was that, while the holographic bound involves Newton’s gravitational constant G, the Bekenstein bound doesn’t.)
Thirdly, speaking of QFT, some readers might be struck by the fact that at no point in our 12-step program did we ever seem to need QFT machinery. Which is fortunate, because if we had needed it, I wouldn’t have been able to explain any of this! But here I have to confess that I cheated slightly. Recall step 4, which said that “if you know the rate at which a field varies across space, you can calculate the rate at which it varies across time.” It turns out that, in order to give that sentence a definite meaning, one uses the fact that in QFT, space and time derivatives in the Hamiltonian need to be related by a factor of c, since otherwise the Hamiltonian wouldn’t be Lorentz-invariant.
Fourthly, eagle-eyed readers might notice a loophole in the argument. Namely, we never upper-bounded how much information God could add to the world, via fields that are constant across all of spacetime. For example, there’s nothing to stop Her from creating a new scalar field that takes the same value everywhere in the universe—with that value, in suitable units, encoding 1050000 separate divine thoughts in its binary expansion. But OK, being constant, such a field would interact with nothing and affect no observations—so Occam’s Razor itches to slice it off, by rewriting the laws of physics in a simpler form where that field is absent. If you like, such a field would at most be a comment in the source code of the universe: it could be as long as the Great Programmer wanted it to be, but would have no observable effect on those of us living inside the program’s execution.
Of course, even before relativity and quantum mechanics, information had already been playing a surprisingly fleshy role in physics, through its appearance as entropy in 19th-century thermodynamics. Which leads to another puzzle. To a computer scientist, the concept of entropy, as the log of the number of microstates compatible with a given macrostate, seems clear enough, as does the intuition for why it should increase monotonically with time. Or at least, to whatever extent we’re confused about these matters, we’re no more confused than the physicists are!
But then why should this information-theoretic concept be so closely connected to tangible quantities like temperature, and pressure, and energy? From the mere assumption that a black hole has a nonzero entropy—that is, that it takes many bits to describe—how could Bekenstein and Hawking have possibly deduced that it also has a nonzero temperature? Or: if you put your finger into a tub of hot water, does the heat that you feel somehow reflect how many bits are needed to describe the water’s microstate?
Once again our skeptic pipes up: “but surely God could stuff as many additional bits as She wanted into the microstate of the hot water—for example, in degrees of freedom that are still unknown to physics—without the new bits having any effect on the water’s temperature.”
But we should’ve learned by now to doubt this sort of argument. There’s no general principle, in our universe, saying that you can hide as many bits as you want in a physical object, without those bits influencing the object’s observable properties. On the contrary, in case after case, our laws of physics seem to be intolerant of “wallflower bits,” which hide in a corner without talking to anyone. If a bit is there, the laws of physics want it to affect other nearby bits and be affected by them in turn.
In the case of thermodynamics, the assumption that does all the real work here is that of equidistribution. That is, whatever degrees of freedom might be available to your thermal system, your gas in a box or whatever, we assume that they’re all already “as randomized as they could possibly be,” subject to a few observed properties like temperature and volume and pressure. (At least, we assume that in classical thermodynamics. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a whole different can of worms, worms that don’t stay in equilibrium.) Crucially, we assume this despite the fact that we might not even know all the relevant degrees of freedom.
Why is this assumption justified? “Because experiment bears it out,” the physics teacher explains—but we can do better. The assumption is justified because, as long as the degrees of freedom that we’re talking about all interact with each other, they’ve already had plenty of time to equilibrate. And conversely, if a degree of freedom doesn’t interact with the stuff we’re observing—or with anything that interacts with the stuff we’re observing, etc.—well then, who cares about it anyway?
But now, because the microscopic laws of physics have the fundamental property of reversibility—that is, they never destroy information—a new bit has to go somewhere, and it can’t overwrite degrees of freedom that are already fully randomized. This is why, if you pump more bits of information into a tub of hot water, while keeping it at the same volume, the new bits have nowhere to go except into pushing up the energy. Now, there are often ways to push up the energy other than by raising the temperature—the concept of specific heat, in chemistry, is precisely about this—but if you need to stuff more bits into a substance, at the cost of raising its energy, certainly one of the obvious ways to do it is to describe a greater range of possible speeds for the water molecules. So since that can happen, by equidistribution it typically does happen, which means that the molecules move faster on average, and your finger feels the water get hotter.
In summary, our laws of physics are structured in such a way that even pure information often has “nowhere to hide”: if the bits are there at all in the abstract machinery of the world, then they’re forced to pipe up and have a measurable effect. And this is not a tautology, but comes about only because of nontrivial facts about special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and thermodynamics. And this is what I think people should mean when they say “information is physical.”
Anyway, if this was all obvious to you, I apologize for having wasted your time! But in my defense, it was never explained to me quite this way, nor was it sorted out in my head until recently—even though it seems like one of the most basic and general things one can possibly say about physics.
Endnotes. Thanks again to Daniel Harlow, not only for explaining the logic of the holographic bound to me but for several suggestions that improved this post.
Some readers might suspect circularity in the arguments we’ve made: are we merely saying that “any information that has observable physical consequences, has observable physical consequences”? No, it’s more than that. In all the examples I discussed, the magic was that we inserted certain information into our abstract mathematical description of the world, taking no care to ensure that the information’s presence would have any observable consequences whatsoever. But then the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, or thermodynamics forced the information to be detectable in very specific ways (namely, via the destruction of quantum interference, the warping of spacetime, or the generation of heat respectively).",22931,"['c63a119da2ad205b6de3aa2c88786694076e5dfa564bed5f029553fe736f4be5',

122,3336,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3336,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2017-07-17,Scott Aaronson,Three things,"I was shocked and horrified to learn of the loss of Maryam Mirzakhani at age 40, after a battle with cancer (see here or here). Mirzakhani was a renowned mathematician at Stanford and the world’s first and so far only female Fields Medalist. I never had the privilege of meeting her, but everything I’ve read about her fills me with admiration. I wish to offer condolences to her friends and family, including her husband Jan Vondrák, also a professor at Stanford and a member of the CS theory community.
In other depressing news, discussion continues to rage on social media about “The Uninhabitable Earth,” the New York magazine article by David Wallace-Wells arguing that the dangers of climate change have been systematically understated even by climate scientists; that sea level rise is the least of the problems; and that if we stay the current course, much of the earth’s landmass has a good chance of being uninhabitable by the year 2100. In an unusual turn of events, the Wallace-Wells piece has been getting slammed by climate scientists, including Michael Mann (see here and also this interview)—people who are usually in the news to refute the claims of deniers.
Some of the critics’ arguments seem cogent to me: for example, that Wallace-Wells misunderstood some satellite data, and more broadly, that the piece misleadingly presents its scenario as overwhelmingly probable by 2100 if we do nothing, rather than as “only” 10% likely or whatever—i.e., a mere Trump-becoming-president level of risk. Other objections to the article impressed me less: for example, that doom-and-gloom is a bad way to motivate people about climate change; that the masses need a more optimistic takeaway. That obviously has no bearing on the truth of what’s going to happen—but even if we did agree to entertain such arguments, well, it’s not as if mainstream messaging on climate change has been an unmitigated success. What if everyone should be sweating-in-the-night terrified?
As far as I understand it, the question of the plausibility of Wallace-Wells’s catastrophe scenario mostly just comes down to a single scientific unknown: namely, will the melting permafrost belch huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere? If it does, then “Armageddon” is probably a fair description of what awaits us in the next century, and if not, not. Alas, our understanding of permafrost doesn’t seem especially reliable, and it strikes me that models of such feedbacks have a long history of erring on the side of conservatism (for example, researchers were astonished by how quickly glaciers and ice shelves fell apart).
So, while I wish the article was written with more caveats, I submit that runaway warming scenarios deserve more attention rather than less. And we should be putting discussion of those scenarios in exactly the broader context that Wallace-Wells does: namely, that of the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the Fermi paradox, and the conditions for a technological civilization to survive past its infancy.
Certainly we spend much more time on risks to civilization (e.g., nuclear terrorism, bioengineered pandemics) that strike me as less probable than this one. And certainly this tail, in the distribution of possible outcomes, deserves at least as much attention as its more popular opposite, the tail where climate change turns out not to be much of a problem at all. For the grim truth about climate change is that history won’t end in 2100: only the projections do. And the mere addition of 50 more years could easily suffice to turn a tail risk into a body risk.
Of course, that the worst will happen is a clear prediction of reverse Hollywoodism theory—besides being the “natural, default” prediction for a computer scientist used to worst-case analysis. This is one prediction that I hope turns out to be as wrong as possible.
OK, now for something to cheer us all up. Yesterday the group of Misha Lukin, at Harvard, put a paper on the arXiv reporting the creation of a 51-qubit quantum simulator using cold atoms. The paper doesn’t directly address the question of quantum supremacy, or indeed of performance comparisons between the new device and classical simulations at all. But this is clearly a big step forward, while the world waits for the fully-programmable 50-qubit superconducting QCs that have been promised by the groups at Google and IBM.
Indeed, this strikes me as the most exciting news in experimental quantum information since last month, when Jian-Wei Pan’s group in Shanghai reported the first transmission of entangled photons from a satellite to earth—thereby allowing violations of the Bell inequality over 1200 kilometers, teleportation of a qubit from earth to space, and other major firsts. These are breakthroughs that we knew were in the works ever since the Chinese government launched the QUESS satellite devoted to quantum communications. I should’ve blogged about them in June. Then again, regular readers of Shtetl-Optimized, familiar as they already are with the universal reach of quantum mechanics and with the general state of quantum information technology, shouldn’t find anything here that fundamentally surprises them, should they?",5190,"['3a807eadf6ca467506e4a5473124bf3169ce61161d29d38eff0b934f7f65ed48', 'ac5cfdd6212b25515235b3d31310d07d7f10edb3c3970c2b0f1e3117b31123cc', 'c36a759fe1d5b2d9a561ed931942e8ab060a5092cb68e020933abf6f3efb7460', '7d9150c10b45d8c77ae8ffe59dc6d0644dcd45579ece26a0e03d87315e183e32', '4bfb15561847e3a2d8ceacbfbce8f262755ed89606c138c9014388659bc6cd3b', 'a1df8fb22023daba642188c3e5979a2bf705fbdc53719478e6e1e1a25b1d0874', '98a580678130a6b396182d8aea0c99104fa8c4b4052db2b7c9c5e3edae01f341', 'ccd054d150d3efb0c1197ec741e51b4af4eaadaaaad5773c161848506fcd2a01', '5fe217a2c32e3682296b8701b8199f49dd29c6f63e51526aca0bb68063b18f4d', 'b9f4fc7a669ae6a2b1e3e527e7cf13157583993c34ca8f7b8017072a41727fb5', '8e3d272a7f2638779eef90fa66b1b4271a2f921457ec85ab34b6dae86e0f9b3f', '53991becfcd28f16e56993f095863d8c58cf032f6bce034eae4e8d95aa448220', 'ad4926f5e4836df29e18ecc68c9d296af1fae10a637c21ab5311d41c76249c02', 'd1a32235190d7f3467f14e0179bb176df684ded563c590909d13318169f8c230', '6c04816378bc5545f1a3eb5e9af7c2ea5ebf6518d62cb38745a2e833208a1018', 'a5c3a49958688fdf5c7688ec32f89808b012420f7b87fb33d4cfbe05e0f99e57', '96d031b1fcaa43e1bf0faf0f1229f3c0a2b47ee3c64285be7f83e2540e7e0b78', '38fbbfc3b7c4e0efd61d6788e3309972421baa48827e3195fb623517af2f9d5b', '0838ec75cf4c3d623d9982d9d015bf4e9605d8313f1437169492cb1763a9428c', '9d8336ae6e360c3be4215ec80f9012ad0d30d66e038026301df8be94292bce79', 'a1077a623791854b852ee500b573412d00629f2c66c030588a421f04b2b8e980', '5ec5cfada1930d7435c3535985c82f5431372d07d9e331a02ea4fea2102dc230', 'e1f9830ee2f01750d685795d5c3fcd530ac7c373a3292c68729666f9f831780d', 'c8b64226e7b06790ba2d5a23f596c8153b84b264585fc02d59a3aa8a80d0a356', '217be381cbb9c1cbd9d2a6dffe115692ca03d9f2f9cd0657bb9764505d0e9d50', '767b0cf7c8a41afeb43135b4b54fbc8706d564ae2aeec028f62992e706436c77', '13977365d9c944ec8b80c72a0896b206f3b31ced194b021fd98ffcce3e2d553c', '6068625d42bf60c253b17a555d5f0a8093750f6868b8b6228b024cd54eda2c2a', 'ef161f8785a291893ade7b520766617f21468ff4c2396617c3d48c3f65b8541a']"

This was my first COLT, but almost certainly not the last. I learned lots of cool new tidbits, from the expressive power of small-depth neural networks, to a modern theoretical computer science definition of “non-discriminatory” (namely, your learning algorithm’s output should be independent of protected categories like race, sex, etc. after conditioning on the truth you’re trying to predict), to the inapproximability of VC dimension (assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis). You can see the full schedule here. Thanks so much to the PC chairs, Ohad Shamir and Satyen Kale, for inviting me and for putting on a great conference.
And one more thing: I’m not normally big on art museums, but Amsterdam turns out to have two in close proximity to each other—the Rijksmuseum and the Stedelijk—each containing something that Shtetl-Optimized readers might recognize.

[Warning: The rest of this post is kinda, sorta technical. Read at your own risk.]
(1) In my 2006 paper “Oracles are subtle but not malicious,” I claimed to show that if PP is contained in BQP/qpoly, then the counting hierarchy collapses to QMA (Theorem 5). But on further reflection, I only know how to show a collapse of the counting hierarchy under the stronger assumption that PP is in BQP/poly. If PP is in BQP/qpoly, then certainly P#P=PP=QMA, but I don’t know how to collapse any further levels of the counting hierarchy. The issue is this: in QMA, we can indeed nondeterministically guess an (amplified) quantum advice state for a BQP/qpoly algorithm. We can then verify that the advice state works to solve PP problems, by using (for example) the interactive protocol for the permanent, or some other #P-complete problem. But having done that, how do we then unravel the higher levels of the counting hierarchy? For example, how do we simulate PPPP in PPBQP=PP? We don’t have any mechanism to pass the quantum advice up to the oracle PP machine, since queries to a PP oracle are by definition classical strings. We could try to use tools from my later paper with Andy Drucker, passing a classical description of the quantum advice up to the oracle and then using the description to reconstruct the advice for ourselves. But doing so just doesn’t seem to give us a complexity class that’s low for PP, which is what would be needed to unravel the counting hierarchy. I still think this result might be recoverable, but a new idea is needed.
(2) In my 2008 algebrization paper with Avi Wigderson, one of the most surprising things we showed was a general connection between communication complexity lower bounds and algebraic query complexity lower bounds. Specifically, given a Boolean oracle A:{0,1}n→{0,1}, let ~A be a low-degree extension of A over a finite field F (that is, ~A(x)=A(x) whenever x∈{0,1}n). Then suppose we have an algorithm that’s able to learn some property of A, by making k black-box queries to ~A. We observed that, in such a case, if Alice is given the top half of the truth table of A, and Bob is given the bottom half of the truth table, then there’s necessarily a communication protocol by which Alice and Bob can learn the same property of A, by exchanging at most O(kn log|F|) bits. This connection is extremely model-independent: a randomized query algorithm gives rise to a randomized communication protocol, a quantum query algorithm gives rise to a quantum communication protocol, etc. etc. The upshot is that, if you want to lower-bound the number of queries that an algorithm needs to make to the algebraic extension oracle ~A, in order to learn something about A, then it suffices to prove a suitable communication complexity lower bound. And the latter, unlike algebraic query complexity, is a well-studied subject with countless results that one can take off the shelf. We illustrated how one could use this connection to prove, for example, that there exists an oracle A such that NPA ⊄ BQP~A, for any low-degree extension ~A of A—a separation that we didn’t and don’t know how to prove any other way. Likewise, there exists an oracle B such that BQPB ⊄ BPP~B for any low-degree extension ~B of B.
The trouble is, our “proof sketches” for these separations (in Theorem 5.11) are inadequate, even for “sketches.” They can often be fixed, but only by appealing to special properties of the communication complexity separations in question, properties that don’t necessarily hold for an arbitrary communication separation between two arbitrary models.
The issue is this: while it’s true, as we claimed, that a communication complexity lower bound implies an algebraic query complexity lower bound, it’s not true in general that a communication complexity upper bound implies an algebraic query complexity upper bound! So, from a communication separation between models C and D, we certainly obtain a query complexity problem that’s not in D~A, but then the problem might not be in CA. What tripped us up was that, in the cases we had in mind (e.g. Disjointness), it’s obvious that the query problem is in CA. In other cases, however, such as Raz’s separation between quantum and randomized communication complexity, it probably isn’t even true. In the latter case, to recover the desired conclusion about algebraic query complexity (namely, the existence of an oracle B such that BQPB ⊄ BPP~B), what seems to be needed is to start from a later quantum vs. classical communication complexity separation due to Klartag and Regev, and then convert their communication problem into a query problem using a recent approach by myself and Shalev Ben-David (see Section 4). Unfortunately, my and Shalev’s approach only tells us nonconstructively that there exists a query problem with the desired separation, with no upper bound on the gate complexity of the quantum algorithm. So strictly speaking, I still don’t know how to get a separation between the relativized complexity classes BQPB and BPP~B defined in terms of Turing machines.
In any case, I of course should have realized this issue with the algebrization paper the moment Shalev and I encountered the same issue when writing our later paper. Let me acknowledge Shalev, as well as Robin Kothari, for helping to spur my realization of the issue.
In case it wasn’t clear, the mistakes I’ve detailed here have no effect on the main results of the papers in question (e.g., the existence of an oracle relative to which PP has linear-sized circuits; the existence and pervasiveness of the algebrization barrier). The effect is entirely on various “bonus” results—results that, because they’re bonus, were gone over much less carefully by authors and reviewers alike.
Nevertheless, I’ve always felt like in science, the louder you are about your own mistakes, the better.

125,3248,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3248,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2017-05-05,Scott Aaronson,This Week’s BS,"There are two pieces of BosonSampling-related news that people have asked me about this week.
First, a group in Shanghai, led by Chaoyang Lu and Jianwei Pan, has reported in Nature Photonics that they can do BosonSampling with a coincidence rate that’s higher than in previous experiments by a factor of several thousand. This, in particular, lets them do BosonSampling with 5 photons. Now, 5 might not sound like that much, especially since the group in Bristol previously did 6-photon BosonSampling. But to make their experiment work, the Bristol group needed to start its photons in the initial state |3,3〉: that is, two modes with 3 photons each. This gives rise to matrices with repeated rows, whose permanents are much easier to calculate than the permanents of arbitrary matrices. By contrast, the Shangai group starts its photons in the “true BosonSampling initial state” |1,1,1,1,1〉: that is, five modes with 1 photon each. That’s the kind of initial state we ultimately want.
The second piece of news is that on Monday, a group at Bristol—overlapping with the group we mentioned before—submitted a preprint to the arXiv with the provocative title “No imminent quantum supremacy by boson sampling.” In this paper, they give numerical evidence that BosonSampling, with n photons and m modes, can be approximately simulated by a classical computer in “merely” about n2n time (that is, the time needed to calculate a single n×n permanent), as opposed to the roughly mn time that one would need if one had to calculate permanents corresponding to all the possible outcomes of the experiment. As a consequence of that, they argue that achieving quantum supremacy via BosonSampling would probably require at least ~50 photons—which would in turn require a “step change” in technology, as they put it.
I completely agree with the Bristol group’s view of the asymptotics. In fact, Alex Arkhipov and I ourselves repeatedly told experimentalists, in our papers and talks about BosonSampling (the question came up often…), that the classical complexity of the problem should only be taken to scale like 2n, rather than like mn. Despite not having a general proof that the problem could actually be solved in ~2n time in the worst case, we said that for two main reasons:
- Even under the most optimistic assumptions, our hardness reductions, from Gaussian permanent estimation and so forth, only yielded ~2n hardness, not ~mn hardness. (Hardness reductions giving us important clues about the real world? Whuda thunk??)
- If our BosonSampling matrix is Haar-random—or otherwise not too skewed to produce outcomes with huge probabilities—then it’s not hard to see that we can do approximate BosonSampling in O(n2n) time classically, by using rejection sampling.
Indeed, Alex and I insisted on these points despite some pushback from experimentalists, who were understandably hoping that they could get to quantum supremacy just by upping m, the number of modes, without needing to do anything heroic with n, the number of photons! So I’m happy to see that a more careful analysis supports the guess that Alex and I made.
On the other hand, what does this mean for the number of photons needed for “quantum supremacy”: is it 20? 30? 50? I confess that that sort of question interests me much less, since it all depends on the details of how you define the comparison (are we comparing against ENIAC? a laptop? a server farm? how many cores? etc etc). As I’ve often said, my real hope with quantum supremacy is to see a quantum advantage that’s so overwhelming—so duh-obvious to the naked eye—that we don’t have to squint or argue about the definitions.",3648,"['fe4cd1c58d473ad5f6a0987664df087062c61cbe920b5d4b4361ea011413b430', 'ff88dbb9563d1b5e20f582ffaac9501aaf9d620df3e1a495fc08f63a8f69eaf2', '664f887ff1dad7274f42fc381e2b3f7880b44b21f46e10509085f63643bf8c11', '678491ee050ecc62f49980ca856e9f134fc43503824ce2660c7fbb129d463582', 'fdb3c08fe6c0fb6ac7a1b8d8c4882d2af2418f00002fc7d4c248e4029457a3ad', '08781f4dd3dd3f84e4d17cf54d17d73dd930d0e380880d9522ce4c34a38a9423', '79b9914ca836bfa475af658ec6980a85e7d146baf4f10707397abba1b15771db', '3ce610c823384230b52f478589625eb925ebca280cab2ae66e518d6181417f1d', '525a687704b0916c42e33b9f69010e1d5e991186cfc9f05ffd13612f1db61a44', '09a406376b9c2372c0c6f7e073623e7dc73c9a683619b93ae7fe5947b8f14dd4', 'cba78cc3f39b7c5b957c4def166c3a2d72c8fda6d3442e87edcf94f7d56484e5', '37e5f07b008949cc6a3203b1c8d3043eb342014083e9b3c2d648a7808cde0909', '9cc7ceb63ca96a885c8c5e64e6bfa17271ee2cb722030519238ed09d9d96244e', '6ff877f4039c5999f17dd05f89115f4a0578de911bc2e7cc45fe96c0c0c9b61e', '18f3564f0be58f05ab69b324a347d81c5e5ac4ea47295798b9f0dcc60d0229d3']"

The moon still waxes and wanes. Electrons remain bound to their nuclei. P≠NP proofs still fill my inbox. Squirrels still gather acorns. And—of course!—people continue to claim big quantum speedups using D-Wave devices, and those claims still require careful scrutiny.
With that preamble, I hereby offer you eight quantum computing news items.
Cathy McGeoch Episode II: The Selby Comparison
On January 17, a group from D-Wave—including Cathy McGeoch, who now works directly for D-Wave—put out a preprint claiming a factor-of-2500 speedup for the D-Wave machine (the new, 2000-qubit one) compared to the best classical algorithms. Notably, they wrote that the speedup persisted when they compared against simulated annealing, quantum Monte Carlo, and even the so-called Hamze-de Freitas-Selby (HFS) algorithm, which was often the classical victor in previous performance comparisons against the D-Wave machine.
Reading this, I was happy to see how far the discussion has advanced since 2013, when McGeoch and Cong Wang reported a factor-of-3600 speedup for the D-Wave machine, but then it turned out that they’d compared only against classical exact solvers rather than heuristics—a choice for which they were heavily criticized on this blog and elsewhere. (And indeed, that particular speedup disappeared once the classical computer’s shackles were removed.)
So, when people asked me this January about the new speedup claim—the one even against the HFS algorithm—I replied that, even though we’ve by now been around this carousel several times, I felt like the ball was now firmly in the D-Wave skeptics’ court, to reproduce the observed performance classically. And if, after a year or so, no one could, that would be a good time to start taking seriously that a D-Wave speedup might finally be here to stay—and to move on to the next question, of whether this speedup had anything to do with quantum computation, or only with the building of a piece of special-purpose optimization hardware.
A&M: Annealing and Matching
As it happened, it only took one month. On March 2, Salvatore Mandrà, Helmut Katzgraber, and Creighton Thomas put up a response preprint, pointing out that the instances studied by the D-Wave group in their most recent comparison are actually reducible to the minimum-weight perfect matching problem—and for that reason, are solvable in polynomial time on a classical computer. Much of Mandrà et al.’s paper just consists of graphs, wherein they plot the running times of the D-Wave machine and of a classical heuristic on the relevant instances—clearly all different flavors of exponential—and then Edmonds’ matching algorithm from the 1960s, which breaks away from the pack into polynomiality.
But let me bend over backwards to tell you the full story. Last week, I had the privilege of visiting Texas A&M to give a talk. While there, I got to meet Helmut Katzgraber, a condensed-matter physicist who’s one of the world experts on quantum annealing experiments, to talk to him about their new response paper. Helmut was clear in his prediction that, with only small modifications to the instances considered, one could see similar performance by the D-Wave machine while avoiding the reduction to perfect matching. With those future modifications, it’s possible that one really might see a D-Wave speedup that survived serious attempts by skeptics to make it go away.
But Helmut was equally clear in saying that, even in such a case, he sees no evidence at present that the speedup would be asymptotic or quantum-computational in nature. In other words, he thinks the existing data is well explained by the observation that we’re comparing D-Wave against classical algorithms for Ising spin minimization problems on Chimera graphs, and D-Wave has heroically engineered an expensive piece of hardware specifically for Ising spin minimization problems on Chimera graphs and basically nothing else. If so, then the prediction would be that such speedups as can be found are unlikely to extend either to more “practical” optimization problems—which need to be embedded into the Chimera graph with considerable losses—or to better scaling behavior on large instances. (As usual, as long as the comparison is against the best classical algorithms, and as long as we grant the classical algorithm the same non-quantum advantages that the D-Wave machine enjoys, such as classical parallelism—as Rønnow et al advocated.)
Incidentally, my visit to Texas A&M was partly an “apology tour.” When I announced on this blog that I was moving from MIT to UT Austin, I talked about the challenge and excitement of setting up a quantum computing research center in a place that currently had little quantum computing for hundreds of miles around. This thoughtless remark inexcusably left out not only my friends at Louisiana State (like Jon Dowling and Mark Wilde), but even closer to home, Katzgraber and the others at Texas A&M. I felt terrible about this for months. So it gives me special satisfaction to have the opportunity to call out Katzgraber’s new work in this post. In football, UT and A&M were longtime arch-rivals, but when it comes to the appropriate level of skepticism to apply to quantum supremacy claims, the Texas Republic seems remarkably unified.
When 15 MilliKelvin is Toasty
In other D-Wave-related scientific news, on Monday night Tameem Albash, Victor Martin-Mayer, and Itay Hen put out a preprint arguing that, in order for quantum annealing to have any real chance of yielding a speedup over classical optimization methods, the temperature of the annealer should decrease at least like 1/log(n), where n is the instance size, and more likely like 1/nβ (i.e., as an inverse power law).
If this is correct, then cold as the D-Wave machine is, at 0.015 degrees or whatever above absolute zero, it still wouldn’t be cold enough to see a scalable speedup, at least not without quantum fault-tolerance, something that D-Wave has so far eschewed. With no error-correction, any constant temperature that’s above zero would cause dangerous level-crossings up to excited states when the instances get large enough. Only a temperature that actually converged to zero as the problems got larger would suffice.
Over the last few years, I’ve heard many experts make this exact same point in conversation, but this is the first time I’ve seen the argument spelled out in a paper, with explicit calculations (modulo assumptions) of the rate at which the temperature would need to go to zero for uncorrected quantum annealing to be a viable path to a speedup. I lack the expertise to evaluate the calculations myself, but any experts who’d like to share their insight in the comments section are “warmly” (har har) invited.
“Their Current Numbers Are Still To Be Checked”
As some of you will have seen, The Economist now has a sprawling 10-page cover story about quantum computing and other quantum technologies. I had some contact with the author while the story was in the works.
The piece covers a lot of ground and contains many true statements. It could be much worse.
But I take issue with two things.
First, The Economist claims: “What is notable about the effort [to build scalable QCs] now is that the challenges are no longer scientific but have become matters of engineering.” As John Preskill and others pointed out, this is pretty far from true, at least if we interpret the claim in the way most engineers and businesspeople would.
Yes, we know the rules of quantum mechanics, and the theory of quantum fault-tolerance, and a few promising applications; and the basic building blocks of QC have already been demonstrated in several platforms. But if (let’s say) someone were to pony up $100 billion, asking only for a universal quantum computer as soon as possible, I think the rational thing to do would be to spend initially on a frenzy of basic research: should we bet on superconducting qubits, trapped ions, nonabelian anyons, photonics, a combination thereof, or something else? (Even that is far from settled.) Can we invent better error-correcting codes and magic state distillation schemes, in order to push the resource requirements for universal QC down by three or four orders of magnitude? Which decoherence mechanisms will be relevant when we try to do this stuff at scale? And of course, which new quantum algorithms can we discover, and which new cryptographic codes resistant to quantum attack?
The second statement I take issue with is this:
“For years experts questioned whether the [D-Wave] devices were actually exploiting quantum mechanics and whether they worked better than traditional computers. Those questions have since been conclusively answered—yes, and sometimes”
I would instead say that the answers are:
- depends on what you mean by “exploit” (yes, there are quantum tunneling effects, but do they help you solve problems faster?), and
- no, the evidence remains weak to nonexistent that the D-Wave machine solves anything faster than a traditional computer—certainly if, by “traditional computer,” we mean a device that gets all the advantages of the D-Wave machine (e.g., classical parallelism, hardware heroically specialized to the one type of problem we’re testing on), but no quantum effects.
Shortly afterward, when discussing the race to achieve “quantum supremacy” (i.e., a clear quantum computing speedup for some task, not necessarily a useful one), the Economist piece hedges: “D-Wave has hinted it has already [achieved quantum supremacy], but has made similar claims in the past; their current numbers are still to be checked.”
To me, “their current numbers are still to be checked” deserves its place alongside “mistakes were made” among the great understatements of the English language—perhaps a fitting honor for The Economist.
Defeat Device
Some of you might also have seen that D-Wave announced a deal with Volkswagen, to use D-Wave machines for traffic flow. I had some advance warning of this deal, when reporters called asking me to comment on it. At least in the materials I saw, no evidence is discussed that the D-Wave machine actually solves whatever problem VW is interested in faster than it could be solved with a classical computer. Indeed, in a pattern we’ve seen repeatedly for the past decade, the question of such evidence is never even directly confronted or acknowledged.
So I guess I’ll say the same thing here that I said to the journalists. Namely, until there’s a paper or some other technical information, obviously there’s not much I can say about this D-Wave/Volkswagen collaboration. But it would be astonishing if quantum supremacy were to be achieved on an application problem of interest to a carmaker, even as scientists struggle to achieve that milestone on contrived and artificial benchmarks, even as the milestone seems repeatedly to elude D-Wave itself on contrived and artificial benchmarks. In the previous such partnerships—such as that with Lockheed Martin—we can reasonably guess that no convincing evidence for quantum supremacy was found, because if it had been, it would’ve been trumpeted from the rooftops.
Anyway, I confess that I couldn’t resist adding a tiny snark—something about how, if these claims of amazing performance were found not to withstand an examination of the details, it would not be the first time in Volkswagen’s recent history.
Farewell to a Visionary Leader—One Who Was Trash-Talking Critics on Social Media A Decade Before President Trump
This isn’t really news, but since it happened since my last D-Wave post, I figured I should share. Apparently D-Wave’s outspoken and inimitable founder, Geordie Rose, left D-Wave to form a machine-learning startup (see D-Wave’s leadership page, where Rose is absent). I wish Geordie the best with his new venture.
Martinis Visits UT Austin
On Feb. 22, we were privileged to have John Martinis of Google visit UT Austin for a day and give the physics colloquium. Martinis concentrated on the quest to achieve quantum supremacy, in the near future, using sampling problems inspired by theoretical proposals such as BosonSampling and IQP, but tailored to Google’s architecture. He elaborated on Google’s plan to build a 49-qubit device within the next few years: basically, a 7×7 square array of superconducting qubits with controllable nearest-neighbor couplings. To a layperson, 49 qubits might sound unimpressive compared to D-Wave’s 2000—but the point is that these qubits will hopefully maintain coherence times thousands of times longer than the D-Wave qubits, and will also support arbitrary quantum computations (rather than only annealing). Obviously I don’t know whether Google will succeed in its announced plan, but if it does, I’m very optimistic about a convincing quantum supremacy demonstration being possible with this sort of device.
Perhaps most memorably, Martinis unveiled some spectacular data, which showed near-perfect agreement between Google’s earlier 9-qubit quantum computer and the theoretical predictions for a simulation of the Hofstadter butterfly (incidentally invented by Douglas Hofstadter, of Gödel, Escher, Bach fame, when he was still a physics graduate student). My colleague Andrew Potter explained to me that the Hofstadter butterfly can’t be used to show quantum supremacy, because it’s mathematically equivalent to a system of non-interacting fermions, and can therefore be simulated in classical polynomial time. But it’s certainly an impressive calibration test for Google’s device.
2000 Qubits Are Easy, 50 Qubits Are Hard
Just like the Google group, IBM has also publicly set itself the ambitious goal of building a 50-qubit superconducting quantum computer in the near future (i.e., the next few years). Here in Austin, IBM held a quantum computing session at South by Southwest, so I went—my first exposure of any kind to SXSW. There were 10 or 15 people in the audience; the purpose of the presentation was to walk through the use of the IBM Quantum Experience in designing 5-qubit quantum circuits and submitting them first to a simulator and then to IBM’s actual superconducting device. (To the end user, of course, the real machine differs from the simulation only in that with the former, you can see the exact effects of decoherence.) Afterward, I chatted with the presenters, who were extremely friendly and knowledgeable, and relieved (they said) that I found nothing substantial to criticize in their summary of quantum computing.
Hope everyone had a great Pi Day and Ides of March.",14947,"['e9ed0273d9d2ee413baa44c5384797f2883fe17facd0017739c3341f6b5ad8bc', 'b7e8f03d91d1d2c4874b9fbbfaa5737abd0787a1f5db6eaa4216d6c4a24327ea', '1f347721dd9f2e2917ca7f036ef36fcea6d1cea01f5d8528e74052e56e5df159', '2fe93a502a79a02681480117bf0f4946ef6b7ac1149e757fbe7101ff66da0de5', 'ead02c03b0fe82c72e83d4855a1df1134f505d4c6cd56406ad0bc763c3aaae4a', 'e26b2716619c342a459f81a4216295bbe6fbf045a03f7feafd5c21dca8687476', '4460cf6134b1acb415ba8b66b33903320ce6f867f4987923499606b6502a0d7d', '5295159fa3b4715f76705e5bc00c0d497e633313f1de77e1a6e9387410fd5322', '341c8578b56325ba5e9ef9a7543364f4b852518187ea120cf3c2909f801cb1c4', 'c8c3622da3443301524fe2db419e622f9247e17b6eff4c11f6fe9c16193172f1', 'b8b8d21a7d6e17e35328ef89858c591a4b2324bd8321fda5efa3b545eb6035fd', '18b2b165098202ed8c1e385bcdb77007a32da7f8fbeb880f0a6749775846e1e8', '3ecd12b6026b50c1ae6e7718c8ec6ca9e2766656137fdd90d78d01bcd8be3dd1', 'fda7f1e36598c5189d2b2a87652fce8867def8b9363bbab0233ac9b3459388d6', '38ad02878d9d29b078b5c32c8baafbbc5a8ebb55bafca2266d57a47547b77144', '9512d2ca25feadf2fcf7acc76d08ef74f433dcb22e363e3887e806b795a8128e', 'a1fe541eae5bcd0a9a25ecf0163e80e80850e7e0fed0bb028ba17b36ca0ff6c7', '9d06153b6ea358b9a2c0713006d32495b371938b533bdd0037c81e40152af038', '464fc2152b12fdb71f8ad9cf9f8fd784a4cfe4f998091e35f85596328df486fd', 'e9fa1a2268250e65f8cf9d47df904d9edd45515258cd07345670938139cae494', '3935db3d706641794f0fc6d036b77917be1f81a7c5bea4b2702c7497468cba87', 'c7d9360807c26c6ad55a31aad2600fd6b774e672b54f89c16c233ee3007336aa', '69bef616b086539075ed7c3eac1018570e5fd3cab446a1f5e63d2f6d2d814ae8', 'b04ea245a12f879e4a9c6b6cb22c9737e6a417b44f701acd48179e5b8b95a5eb', '3541f2e5927e041036f10b5d9ee3e93d1f6db5d6fc8001e17f500361822b4711', '06b7fe9e8bf70e4bf4faf0d9f644433780f8d811c1dc7e5bc5bc5edcfa6c30d6', '81cf3c5b5a2d10532781f5c21b8c387cb39ed9874f5da61cb25034c7d3f1a388', '116e434cc9b302ca970d1951c99e4c089d98c577c289f8734b634855048af6dd', 'fac3e85259b55b5c226a244c547977e66c0b252df68fee212309c3d0d41bedac', '17de6db6d3bf260c982b8327e7efb03bf4d39a39676cf3733b772f592f0a65c8', '5081d46753fac93f90339e8eaf386ae50af82e0aeff5f6820381f626d10f83de', '2a953bc3ab328b5e58b02ba87fa15510627ccb6ca848715ad9de93625db480da']"

Just to whet your appetite:
In case you’re wondering how this came about: after our mutual friend Sean Carroll introduced me and Zach for a different reason, the idea of a joint quantum computing comic just seemed too good to pass up. The basic premise—“The Talk”—was all Zach. I dutifully drafted some dialogue for him, which he then improved and illustrated.

128,2996,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2996,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2016-11-24,Scott Aaronson,Quantum computing news (98% Trump-free),"(1) Apparently Microsoft has decided to make a major investment in building topological quantum computers, which will include hiring Charles Marcus and Matthias Troyer among others. See here for their blog post, and here for the New York Times piece. In the race to implement QC among the established corporate labs, Microsoft thus joins the Martinis group at Google, as well as the IBM group at T. J. Watson—though both Google and IBM are focused on superconducting qubits, rather than the more exotic nonabelian anyon approach that Microsoft has long favored and is now doubling down on. I don’t really know more about this new initiative beyond what’s in the articles, but I know many of the people involved, they’re some of the most serious in the business, and Microsoft intensifying its commitment to QC can only be good for the field. I wish the new effort every success, despite being personally agnostic between superconducting qubits, trapped ions, photonics, nonabelian anyons, and other QC hardware proposals—whichever one gets there first is fine with me!
(2) For me, though, perhaps the most exciting QC development of the last month was a new preprint by my longtime friend Dorit Aharonov and her colleague Yosi Atia, entitled Fast-Forwarding of Hamiltonians and Exponentially Precise Measurements. In this work, Dorit and Yosi wield the clarifying sword of computational complexity at one of the most historically confusing issues in quantum mechanics: namely, the so-called “time-energy uncertainty principle” (TEUP).
The TEUP says that, just as position and momentum are conjugate in quantum mechanics, so too are energy and time—with greater precision in energy corresponding to lesser precision in time and vice versa. The trouble is, it was never 100% clear what the TEUP even meant—after all, time isn’t even an observable in quantum mechanics, just an external parameter—and, to whatever extent the TEUP did have a definite meaning, it wasn’t clear that it was true. Indeed, as Dorit and Yosi’s paper discusses in detail, in 1961 Dorit’s uncle Yakir Aharonov, together with David Bohm, gave a counterexample to a natural interpretation of the TEUP. But, despite this and other counterexamples, the general feeling among physicists—who, after all, are physicists!—seems to have been that some corrected version of the TEUP should hold “in all reasonable circumstances.”
But, OK, what do we mean by a “reasonable circumstance”? This is where Dorit and Yosi come in. In the new work, they present a compelling case that the TEUP should really be formulated as a tradeoff between the precision of energy measurements and circuit complexity (that is, the minimum number of gates needed to implement the energy measurement)—and in that amended form, the TEUP holds for exactly those Hamiltonians H that can’t be “computationally fast-forwarded.” In other words, it holds whenever applying the unitary transformation e-iHt requires close to t computation steps, when there’s no magical shortcut that lets you simulate t steps of time evolution with only (say) log(t) steps. And, just as the physicists handwavingly thought, that should indeed hold for “generic” Hamiltonians H (assuming BQP≠PSPACE), although it’s possible to use Shor’s algorithm, for finding the order of an element in a multiplicative group, to devise a counterexample to it.
Anyway, there’s lots of other stuff in the paper, including a connection to the stuff Lenny Susskind and I have been doing about the “generic” growth of circuit complexity, in the CFT dual of an expanding wormhole (where we also needed to assume BQP≠PSPACE and closely related complexity separations, for much the same reasons). Congratulations to Dorit and Yosi for once again illustrating the long reach of computational complexity in physics, and for giving me a reason to be happy this month!
(3) As many of you will have seen, my former MIT colleagues, Lior Eldar and Peter Shor, recently posted an arXiv preprint claiming a bombshell result: namely, a polynomial-time quantum algorithm to solve a variant of the Closest Vector Problem in lattices. Their claimed algorithm wouldn’t yet break lattice-based cryptography, but if the approximation factors could be improved, it would be well on the way to doing so. This has been one of the most tempting targets for quantum algorithms research for more than twenty years—ever since Shor’s “original” algorithm laid waste to RSA, Diffie-Hellman, elliptic-curve cryptography, and more in a world with scalable quantum computers, leaving lattice-based cryptography as one of the few public-key crypto proposals still standing.
Unfortunately, Lior tells me that Oded Regev has discovered a flaw in the algorithm, which he and Peter don’t currently know how to fix. So for now, they’re withdrawing the paper (because of the Thanksgiving holiday, the withdrawal won’t take effect on the arXiv until Monday). It’s still a worthy attempt on a great problem—here’s hoping that they or someone else manage to, as Lior put it to me, “make the algorithm great again.”",5069,"['07f1152cf265eabbf12a70fd1c177040b55bbd4f0e43e5e125846e40f28e1d05', '44f2f2761224a162d2d2ef182774d85e52a49a59944117d21edd66922424b601', '655e5f8d4181913746d38373f0a12a7938cef8e3498daa65484c39eaa91c1d7b', '6d1357faa32cfd847214d0d9b88d99de3cdc3047d6c026ffc68abca0cd4c408e', '6a88a27b35e05540864753eafb4c442098cb22270952c75c826f01ff987c3684', '11947db958aaba91141bfa866054d1634aef7c86ea0b04af66f92b64e5468032', '044928cc0134c7190b413a495e1de19645c94c47357f8365609ee9f88649b69d', '1715b2a192567a4d2654605738d2b63c7b79b17895c7658cf694cec15b6f4ee0', 'b21ea36fb4c234a96ab98bb7229f9089aad5595a6e401e16305578ba3d16e323', '86281547afedf2404682157eabba0b5ba48a5fef002cba0349743df8e362214d', '78c86e6f76c65c88a8202dce0b88e980435619af48903770094b95a2f191902a', '0f1a44441fc007de8151e4576ec40b31e718f100480af06dbb5ba4dd0bcb8b25', '08d8561411eeccc214352a87526a796de3b3960fd4e818cad17c6ab02bee8d3c', 'ef6888f428db6b8bcfd2536d6a8071f58c2d39982cc54216afbcfc7f1b5cbd05', '634452aebf489fddc9a09b6c425f80fd4df2ccfb36afafc82ddc1be9cdbaafab', 'd64aee3679cca68dca709f8db375ef4bd47085d5d5910a7c9dd73fbb3e7fb57a', 'bd0fc42352375be9528938205001c45cd18e4c3f95cd48e68712c960255f6c1f', 'd7fa784c81873fd1fc358437d3e8194e905545a9661d0aa4525f1b88cb24b131', '0fcc46066d3437295037cbaef25ded6d6996a8d85f4f31e7f0a61607f13472bc', 'e7699aa58cddedbe89218a70f646cdb131dd26d611da71c60f7014a962137202', 'f3053b3b70d56d6f440a2f67ca3c169d051938c02c8068b1822fe4e0e7cdab5a', '5e6c2b440ce644b20969e971b074048ea23e32b4e809f20862b036f06edd4236', 'a4a4fd5e7b476033b68cac7e9185274f0201e085af5f40fc3b716da9a390b587', '749f28abc34c4d7fc628a0549801efe399d3fb257ce80eb3d436cab12aff391a', 'e4c68ccbe5f693eb0d3c6304324f8adb291fffc274b8dc538f6b61912adbd8b7']"

And President Obama wasn’t there—maybe, like Justin Trudeau, he already knows everything about quantum computing? But lots of people from the Office of Science and Technology Policy were! And some of us talked with Valerie Jarrett, Obama’s adviser, when she passed us on her way to the West Wing.
The occasion was a Quantum Information Science policy workshop that OSTP held, and which the White House explicitly gave us permission to discuss on social media. Indeed, John Preskill already tweeted photos from the event. Besides me and Preskill, others in attendance included Umesh Vazirani, Seth Lloyd, Yaoyun Shi, Rob Schoelkopf, Krysta Svore, Hartmut Neven, Stephen Jordan…
I don’t know whether this is the first time that the polynomial hierarchy, or the notion of variation distance, were ever invoked in a speech at the White House. But in any case, I was proud to receive a box of Hershey Kisses bearing the presidential seal. I thought of not eating them, but then I got hungry, and realized that I can simply refill the box later if desired.
For regular readers of Shtetl-Optimized, my talk won’t have all that much that’s new, but in any case it’s short.
Incidentally, during the workshop, a guy from OSTP told me that, when he and others at the White House were asked to prepare materials about quantum computing, posts on Shtetl-Optimized (such as Shor I’ll Do It) were a huge help. Honored though I was to have “served my country,” I winced, thinking about all the puerile doofosities I might’ve self-censored had I had any idea who might read them. I didn’t dare ask whether anyone at the White House also reads the comment sections!

Quantum Supremacy
by Scott Aaronson (UT Austin)
October 18, 2016
Thank you; it’s great to be here. There are lots of directions that excite me enormously right now in quantum computing theory, which is what I work on. For example, there’s the use of quantum computing to get new insight into classical computation, into condensed matter physics, and recently, even into the black hole information problem.
But since I have five minutes, I wanted to talk here about one particular direction—one that, like nothing else that I know of, bridges theory and experiment in the service of what we hope will be a spectacular result in the near future. This direction is what’s known as “Quantum Supremacy”—John [Preskill], did you help popularize that term? [John nods yes]—although some people have been backing away from the term recently, because of the campaign of one of the possible future occupants of this here complex.
But what quantum supremacy means to me, is demonstrating a quantum speedup for some task as confidently as possible. Notice that I didn’t say a useful task! I like to say that for me, the #1 application of quantum computing—more than codebreaking, machine learning, or even quantum simulation—is just disproving the people who say quantum computing is impossible! So, quantum supremacy targets that application.
What is important for quantum supremacy is that we solve a clearly defined problem, with some relationship between inputs and outputs that’s independent of whatever hardware we’re using to solve the problem. That’s part of why it doesn’t cut it to point to some complicated, hard-to-simulate molecule and say “aha! quantum supremacy!”
One discovery, which I and others stumbled on 7 or 8 years ago, is that quantum supremacy seems to become much easier to demonstrate if we switch from problems with a single valid output to sampling problems: that is, problems of sampling exactly or approximately from some specified probability distribution.
Doing this has two advantages. First, we no longer need a full, fault-tolerant quantum computer—in fact, very rudimentary types of quantum hardware appear to suffice. Second, we can design sampling problems for which we can arguably be more confident that they really are hard for a classical computer, than we are that (say) factoring is classically hard. I like to say that a fast classical factoring algorithm might collapse the world’s electronic commerce, but as far as we know, it wouldn’t collapse the polynomial hierarchy! But with sampling problems, at least with exact sampling, we can often show the latter implication, which is about the best evidence you can possibly get for such a problem being hard in the present state of mathematics.
One example of these sampling tasks that we think are classically hard is BosonSampling, which Alex Arkhipov and I proposed in 2011. BosonSampling uses a bunch of identical photons that are sent through a network of beamsplitters, then measured to count the number of photons in each output mode. Over the past few years, this proposal has been experimentally demonstrated by quantum optics groups around the world, with the current record being a 6-photon demonstration by the O’Brien group in Bristol, UK. A second example is the IQP (“Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-Time”) or Commuting Hamiltonians model of Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd.
A third example—no doubt the simplest—is just to sample from the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, let’s say on a 2D square lattice of qubits with nearest-neighbor interactions. Notably, this last task is one that the Martinis group at Google is working toward achieving right now, with 40-50 qubits. They say that they’ll achieve it in as little as one or two years, which translated from experimental jargon, means maybe five years? But not infinity years.
The challenges on the experimental side are clear: get enough qubits with long enough coherence times to achieve this. But there are also some huge theoretical challenges remaining.
A first is, can we still solve classically hard sampling problems even in the presence of realistic experimental imperfections? Arkhipov and I already thought about that problem—in particular, about sampling from a distribution that’s merely close in variation distance to the BosonSampling one—and got results that admittedly weren’t as satisfactory as the results for exact sampling. But I’m delighted to say that, just within the last month or two, there have been some excellent new papers on the arXiv that tackle exactly this question, with both positive and negative results.
A second theoretical challenge is, how do we verify the results of a quantum supremacy experiment? Note that, as far as we know today, verification could itself require classical exponential time. But that’s not the showstopper that some people think, since we could target the “sweet spot” of 40-50 qubits, where classical verification is difficult (and in particular, clearly “costlier” than running the experiment itself), but also far from impossible with cluster computing resources.
If I have any policy advice, it’s this: recognize that a clear demonstration of quantum supremacy is at least as big a deal as (say) the discovery of the Higgs boson. After this scientific milestone is achieved, I predict that the whole discussion of commercial applications of quantum computing will shift to a new plane, much like the Manhattan Project shifted to a new plane after Fermi built his pile under the Chicago stadium in 1942. In other words: at this point, the most “applied” thing to do might be to set applications aside temporarily, and just achieve this quantum supremacy milestone—i.e., build the quantum computing Fermi pile—and thereby show the world that quantum computing speedups are a reality.

Videos of all the talks (including mine) are now available here.
Thanks so much to Sanjeev Arora, Boaz Barak, Ran Raz, Peter Sarnak, and Amir Shpilka for organizing the conference and for inviting me to speak; to all the other participants and speakers for a great conference; and of course to Avi himself for being Avi. –SA
I apologize that I wasn’t able to prepare slides for today’s talk. But the good news is that, ever since I moved to Texas two months ago, I now carry concealed chalk everywhere I go. [Pull chalk out of pocket]
My history with Avi goes back literally half my life. I spent a semester with him at Hebrew University, and then a year with him as a postdoc here at IAS. Avi has played a bigger role in my career than just about anyone—he helped me professionally, he helped me intellectually, and once I dated and then married an Israeli theoretical computer scientist (who was also a postdoc in Avi’s group), Avi even helped me learn Hebrew. Just today, Avi taught me the Hebrew word for the permanent of a matrix. It turns out that it’s [throaty noises] pehhrmahnent.
But it all started with a talk that Avi gave in Princeton in 2000, which I attended as a prospective graduate student. That talk was about the following function of an n×n matrix A∈Rn×n, the permanent:
$$ \text{Per}(A) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\sigma(i)}. $$
Avi contrasted that function with a superficially similar function, the determinant:
$$ \text{Det}(A) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} (-1)^{\text{sgn}(\sigma)} \prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\sigma(i)}. $$
In this talk, I want to share a few of the amazing things Avi said about these two functions, and how the things he said then reverberated through my entire career.
Firstly, like we all learn in kindergarten or whatever, the determinant is computable in polynomial time, for example by using Gaussian elimination. By contrast, Valiant proved in 1979 that computing the permanent is #P-complete—which means, at least as hard as any combinatorial counting problem, a class believed to be even harder than NP-complete.
So, despite differing from each other only by some innocent-looking -1 factors, which the determinant has but the permanent lacks, these two functions effectively engage different regions of mathematics. The determinant is linear-algebraic and geometric; it’s the product of the eigenvalues and the volume of the parallelipiped defined by the row vectors. But the permanent is much more stubbornly combinatorial. It’s not quite as pervasive in mathematics as the determinant is, though it does show up. As an example, if you have a bipartite graph G, then the permanent of G’s adjacency matrix counts the number of perfect matchings in G.
When n=2, computing the permanent doesn’t look too different from computing the determinant: indeed, we have
$$
\text{Per}\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{cc}%
a & b\\
c & d
\end{array}
\right) =\text{Det}\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{cc}%
a & -b\\
c & d
\end{array}
\right).
$$
But as n gets larger, the fact that the permanent is #P-complete means that it must get exponentially harder to compute than the determinant, unless basic complexity classes collapse. And indeed, to this day, the fastest known algorithm to compute an n×n permanent, Ryser’s algorithm, takes O(n2n) time, which is only modestly better than the brute-force algorithm that just sums all n! terms.
Yet interestingly, not everything about the permanent is hard. So for example, if A is nonnegative, then in 1997, Jerrum, Sinclair, and Vigoda famously gave a polynomial-time randomized algorithm to approximate Per(A) to within a 1+ε multiplicative factor, for ε>0 as small as you like. As an even simpler example, if A is nonnegative and you just want to know whether its permanent is zero or nonzero, that’s equivalent to deciding whether a bipartite graph has at least one perfect matching. And we all know that that can be done in polynomial time.
OK, but the usual algorithm from the textbooks that puts the matching problem in the class P is already a slightly nontrivial one—maybe first grade rather than kindergarten! It involves repeatedly using depth-first search to construct augmenting paths, then modifying the graph, etc. etc.
Sixteen years ago in Princeton, the first thing Avi said that blew my mind is that there’s a vastly simpler polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether a bipartite graph has a perfect matching—or equivalently, to decide whether a nonnegative matrix has a zero or nonzero permanent. This algorithm is not quite as efficient as the textbook one, but it makes up for it by being more magical.
So here’s what you do: you start with the 0/1 adjacency matrix of your graph. I’ll do a 2×2 example, since that’s all I’ll be able to compute on the fly:
$$ \left(
\begin{array}
[c]{cc}%
1 & 1\\
0 & 1
\end{array}
\right). $$
Then you normalize each row so it sums to 1. In the above example, this would give
$$ \left(
\begin{array}
[c]{cc}%
\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \\
0 & 1
\end{array}
\right). $$
Next you normalize each column so it sums to 1:
$$ \left(
\begin{array}
[c]{cc}%
1 & \frac{1}{3} \\
0 & \frac{2}{3}
\end{array}
\right). $$
OK, but now the problem is that the rows are no longer normalized, so you normalize them again:
$$ \left(
\begin{array}
[c]{cc}%
\frac{3}{4} & \frac{1}{4} \\
0 & 1
\end{array}
\right). $$
Then you normalize the columns again, and so on. You repeat something like n3log(n) times. If, after that time, all the row sums and column sums have become within ±1/n of 1, then you conclude that the permanent was nonzero and the graph had a perfect matching. Otherwise, the permanent was zero and the graph had no perfect matching.
What gives? Well, it’s a nice exercise to prove why this works. I’ll just give you a sketch: first, when you multiply any row or column of a matrix by a scalar, you multiply the permanent by that same scalar. By using that fact, together with the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality, it’s possible to prove that, in every iteration but the first, when you rebalance all the rows or all the columns to sum to 1, you can’t be decreasing the permanent. The permanent increases monotonically.
Second, if the permanent is nonzero, then after the first iteration it’s at least 1/nn, simply because we started with a matrix of 0’s and 1’s.
Third, the permanent is always at most the product of the row sums or the product of the column sums, which after the first iteration is 1.
Fourth, at any iteration where there’s some row sum or column sum that’s far from 1, rescaling must not only increase the permanent, but increase it by an appreciable amount—like, a 1+1/n2 factor or so.
Putting these four observations together, we find that if the permanent is nonzero, then our scaling procedure must terminate after a polynomial number of steps, with every row sum and every column sum close to 1—since otherwise, the permanent would just keep on increasing past its upper bound of 1.
But a converse statement is also true. Suppose the matrix can be scaled so that every row sum and every column sum gets within ±1/n of 1. Then the rescaled entries define a flow through the bipartite graph, with roughly the same amount of flow through each of the 2n vertices. But if such a flow exists, then Hall’s Theorem tells you that there must be a perfect matching (and hence the permanent must be nonzero)—since if a matching didn’t exist, then there would necessarily be a bottleneck preventing the flow.
Together with Nati Linial and Alex Samorodnitsky, Avi generalized this to show that scaling the rows and columns gives you a polynomial-time algorithm to approximate the permanent of a nonnegative matrix. This basically follows from the so-called Egorychev-Falikman Theorem, which says that the permanent of a doubly stochastic matrix is at least n!/nn. The approximation ratio that you get this way, ~en, isn’t nearly as good as Jerrum-Sinclair-Vigoda’s, but the advantage is that the algorithm is deterministic (and also ridiculously simple).
For myself, though, I just filed away this idea of matrix scaling for whenever I might need it. It didn’t take long. A year after Avi’s lecture, when I was a beginning grad student at Berkeley, I was obsessing about the foundations of quantum mechanics. Specifically, I was obsessing about the fact that, when you measure a quantum state, the rules of quantum mechanics tell you how to calculate the probability that you’ll see a particular outcome. But the rules are silent about so-called multiple-time or transition probabilities. In other words: suppose we adopt Everett’s Many-Worlds view, according to which quantum mechanics needs to be applied consistently to every system, regardless of scale, so in particular, the state of the entire universe (including us) is a quantum superposition state. We perceive just one branch, but there are also these other branches where we made different choices or where different things happened to us, etc.
OK, fine: for me, that’s not the troubling part! The troubling part is that quantum mechanics rejects as meaningless questions like the following: given that you’re in this branch of the superposition at time t1, what’s the probability that you’ll be in that branch at time t2, after some unitary transformation is applied? Orthodox quantum mechanics would say: well, either someone measured you at time t1, in which case their act of measuring collapsed the superposition and created a whole new situation. Or else no one measured at t1—but in that case, your state at time t1 was the superposition state, full stop. It’s sheer metaphysics to imagine a “real you” that jumps around from one branch of the superposition to another, having a sequence of definite experiences.
Granted, in practice, branches of the universe’s superposition that split from each other tend never to rejoin, for the same thermodynamic reasons why eggs tend never to unscramble themselves. And as long as the history of the Everettian multiverse has the structure of a tree, we can sensibly define transition probabilities. But if, with some technology of the remote future, we were able to do quantum interference experiments on human brains (or other conscious entities), the rules of quantum mechanics would no longer predict what those beings should see—not even probabilistically.
I was interested in the question: suppose we just wanted to postulate transition probabilities, with the transitions taking place in some fixed orthogonal basis. What would be a mathematically reasonable way to do that? And it occurred to me that one thing you could do is the following. Suppose for simplicity that you have a pure quantum state, which is just a unit vector of n complex numbers called amplitudes:
$$ \left(
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%
\alpha_{1}\\
\vdots\\
\alpha_{n}%
\end{array}
\right) $$
Then the first rule of quantum mechanics says that you can apply any unitary transformation U (that is, any norm-preserving linear transformation) to map this state to a new one:
$$ \left(
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%
\beta_{1}\\
\vdots\\
\beta_{n}%
\end{array}
\right) =\left(
\begin{array}
[c]{ccc}%
u_{11} & \cdots & u_{1n}\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
u_{n1} & \cdots & u_{nn}%
\end{array}
\right) \left(
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%
\alpha_{1}\\
\vdots\\
\alpha_{n}%
\end{array}
\right). $$
The second rule of quantum mechanics, the famous Born Rule, says that if you measure in the standard basis before applying U, then the probability that you’ll find youself in state i equals |αi|2. Likewise, if you measure in the standard basis after applying U, the probability that you’ll find youself in state j equals |βj|2.
OK, but what’s the probability that you’re in state i at the initial time, and then state j at the final time? These joint probabilities, call them pij, had better add up to |αi|2 and |βj|2, if we sum the rows and columns respectively. And ideally, they should be “derived” in some way from the unitary U—so that for example, if uij=0 then pij=0 as well.
So here’s something you could do: start by replacing each uij by its absolute value, to get a nonnegative matrix. Then, normalize the ith row so that it sums to |αi|2, for each i. Then normalize the jth column so that it sums to |βj|2, for each j. Then normalize the rows, then the columns, and keep iterating until hopefully you end up with all the rows and columns having the right sums.
So the first question I faced was, does this process converge? And I remembered what Avi taught me about the permanent. In this case, because of the nonuniform row and column scalings, the permanent no longer works as a progress measure, but there’s something else that does work. Namely, as a first step, we can use the Max-Flow/Min-Cut Theorem to show that there exists a nonnegative matrix F=(fij) such that fij=0 whenever uij=0, and also
$$ \sum_j f_{ij} = \left|\alpha_i\right|^2 \forall i,\ \ \ \ \ \sum_i f_{ij} = \left|\beta_j\right|^2 \forall j. $$
Then, letting M=(mij) be our current rescaled matrix (so that initially mij:=|uij|), we use
$$ \prod_{i,j : u_{ij}\ne 0} m_{ij}^{f_{ij}} $$
as our progress measure. By using the nonnegativity of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, one can prove that this quantity never decreases. So then, just like with 0/1 matrices and the permanent, we get eventual convergence, and indeed convergence after a number of iterations that’s polynomial in n.
I was pretty stoked about this until I went to the library, and discovered that Erwin Schrödinger had proposed the same matrix scaling process in 1931! And Masao Nagasawa and others then rigorously analyzed it. OK, but their motivations were somewhat different, and for some reason they never talked about finite-dimensional matrices, only infinite-dimensional ones.
I can’t resist telling you my favorite open problem about this matrix scaling process: namely, is it stable under small perturbations? In other words, if I change one of the αi‘s or uij‘s by some small ε, then do the final pij‘s also change by at most some small δ? To clarify, several people have shown me how to prove that the mapping to the pij‘s is continuous. But for computer science applications, one needs something stronger: namely that when the matrix M, and the row and column scalings, actually arise from a unitary matrix in the way above, we get strong uniform continuity, with a 1/nO(1) change to the inputs producing only a 1/nO(1) change to the outputs (and hopefully even better than that).
The more general idea that I was groping toward or reinventing here is called a hidden-variable theory, of which the most famous example is Bohmian mechanics. Again, though, Bohmian mechanics has the defect that it’s only formulated for some exotic state space that the physicists care about for some reason—a space involving pointlike objects called “particles” that move around in 3 Euclidean dimensions (why 3? why not 17?).
Anyway, this whole thing led me to wonder: under the Schrödinger scaling process, or something like it, what’s the computational complexity of sampling an entire history of the hidden variable through a quantum computation? (“If, at the moment of your death, your whole life history flashes before you in an instant, what can you then efficiently compute?”)
Clearly the complexity is at least BQP (i.e., quantum polynomial time), because even sampling where the hidden variable is at a single time is equivalent to sampling the output distribution of a quantum computer. But could the complexity be even more than BQP, because of the correlations between the hidden variable values at different times? I noticed that, indeed, sampling a hidden variable history would let you do some crazy-seeming things, like solve the Graph Isomorphism problem in polynomial time (OK, fine, that seemed more impressive at the time than it does after Babai’s breakthrough), or find collisions in arbitrary cryptographic hash functions, or more generally, solve any problem in the complexity class SZK (Statistical Zero Knowledge).
But you might ask: what evidence do we have that any these problems are hard even for garden-variety quantum computers? As many of you know, it’s widely conjectured today that NP⊄BQP—i.e., that quantum computers can’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. And in the “black box” setting, where all you know how to do is query candidate solutions to your NP-complete problem to check whether they’re valid, it’s been proven that quantum computers don’t give you an exponential speedup: the best they can give is the square-root speedup of Grover’s algorithm.
But for these SZK problems, like finding collisions in hash functions, who the hell knows? So, this is the line of thought that led me to probably the most important thing I did in grad school, the so-called quantum lower bound for collision-finding. That result says that, if (again) your hash function is only accessible as a black box, then a quantum computer can provide at most a polynomial speedup over a classical computer for finding collisions in it (in this case, it turns out, at most a two-thirds power speedup). There are several reasons you might care about that, such as showing that one of the basic building blocks of modern cryptography could still be secure in a world with quantum computers, or proving an oracle separation between SZK and BQP. But my original motivation was just to understand how transition probabilities would change quantum computation.
The permanent has also shown up in a much more direct way in my work on quantum computation. If we go back to Avi’s lecture from 2000, a second thing he said that blew my mind was that apparently, or so he had heard, even the fundamental particles of the universe know something about the determinant and the permanent. In particular, he said, fermions—the matter particles, like the quarks and electrons in this stage—have transition amplitudes that are determinants of matrices. Meanwhile, bosons—the force-carrying particles, like the photons coming from the ceiling that let you see this talk—have transition amplitudes that are permanents of matrices.
Or as Steven Weinberg, one of the great physicists on earth, memorably put it in the first edition of his recent quantum mechanics textbook: “in the case of bosons, it is also a determinant, except without minus signs.” I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know Weinberg at Austin, so recently I asked him about that line. He told me that of course he knew that the determinant without minus signs is called a permanent, but he thought no one else would know! As far as he knew, the permanent was just some esoteric function used by a few quantum field theorists who needed to calculate boson amplitudes.
Briefly, the reason why the permanent and determinant turn up here is the following: whenever you have n particles that are identical, to calculate the amplitude for them to do something, you need to sum over all n! possible permutations of the particles. Furthermore, each contribution to the sum is a product of n complex numbers, one uij for each particle that hops from i to j. But there’s a difference: when you swap two identical bosons, nothing happens, and that’s why bosons give rise to the permanent (of an n×n complex matrix, if there are n bosons). By contrast, when you swap two identical fermions, the amplitude for that state of the universe gets multiplied by -1, and that’s why fermions give rise to the determinant.
Anyway, Avi ended his talk with a quip about how unfair it seemed to the bosons that they should have to work so much harder than the fermions just to calculate where they should be!
And then that one joke of Avi—that way of looking at things—rattled around in my head for a decade, like a song I couldn’t get rid of. It raised the question: wait a minute, bosons—particles that occur in Nature—are governed by a #P-complete function? Does that mean we could actually use bosons to solve #P-complete problems in polynomial time? That seems ridiculous, like the kind of nonsense I’m fighting every few weeks on my blog! As I said before, most of us don’t even expect quantum computers to be able to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, let alone #P-complete ones.
As it happens, Troyansky and Tishby had already taken up that puzzle in 1996. (Indeed Avi, being the social butterfly and hub node of our field that he is, had learned about the role of permaments and determinants in quantum mechanics from them.) What Troyansky and Tishby said was, it’s true that if you have a system of n identical, non-interacting bosons, their transition amplitudes are given by permanents of n×n matrices. OK, but amplitudes in quantum mechanics are not directly observable. They’re just what you use to calculate the probability that you’ll see this or that measurement outcome. But if you try to encode a hard instance of a #P-complete problem into a bosonic system, the relevant amplitudes will in general be exponentially small. And that means that, if you want a decent estimate of the permanent, you’ll need to repeat the experiment an exponential number of times. So OK, they said, nice try, but this doesn’t give you a computational advantage after all in calculating the permanent compared to classical brute force.
In our 2011 work on BosonSampling, my student Alex Arkhipov and I reopened the question. We said, not so fast. It’s true that bosons don’t seem to help you in estimating the permanent of a specific matrix of your choice. But what if your goal was just to sample a random n×n matrix A∈Cn×n, in a way that’s somehow biased toward matrices with larger permanents? Now, why would that be your goal? I have no idea! But this sampling is something that a bosonic system would easily let you do.
So, what Arkhipov and I proved was that this gives rise to a class of probability distributions that can be sampled in quantum polynomial time (indeed, by a very rudimentary type of quantum computer), but that can’t be sampled in classical polynomial time unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. And even though you’re not solving a #P-complete problem, the #P-completeness of the permanent still plays a crucial role in explaining why the sampling problem is hard. (Basically, one proves that the probabilities are #P-hard even to approximate, but that if there were a fast classical sampling algorithm, then the probabilities could be approximated in the class BPPNP. So if a fast classical sampling algorithm existed, then P#P would equal BPPNP, which would collapse the polynomial hierarchy by Toda’s Theorem.)
When we started on this, Arkhipov and I thought about it as just pure complexity theory—conceptually clarifying what role the #P-completeness of the permanent plays in physics. But then at some point it occurred to us: bosons (such as photons) actually exist, and experimentalists in quantum optics like to play with them, so maybe they could demonstrate some of this stuff in the lab. And as it turned out, the quantum optics people were looking for something to do at the time, and they ate it up.
Over the past five years, a trend has arisen in experimental physics that goes by the name “Quantum Supremacy,” although some people are now backing away from the name because of Trump. The idea is: without yet having a universal quantum computer, can we use the hardware that we’re able to build today to demonstrate the reality of a quantum-computational speedup as clearly as possible? Not necessarily for a useful problem, but just for some problem? Of course, no experiment can prove that something is scaling polynomially rather than exponentially, since that’s an asymptotic statement. But an experiment could certainly raise the stakes for the people who deny such a statement—for example, by solving something a trillion times faster than we know how to solve it otherwise, using methods for which we don’t know a reason for them not to scale.
I like to say that for me, the #1 application of quantum computing, more than breaking RSA or even simulating physics and chemistry, is simply disproving the people who say that quantum computing is impossible! So, quantum supremacy targets that application.
Experimental BosonSampling has become a major part of the race to demonstrate quantum supremacy. By now, at least a half-dozen groups around the world have reported small-scale implementations—the record, so far, being an experiment at Bristol that used 6 photons, and experimentally confirmed that, yes, their transition amplitudes are given by permanents of 6×6 complex matrices. The challenge now is to build single-photon sources that are good enough that you could scale up to (let’s say) 30 photons, which is where you’d really start seeing a quantum advantage over the best known classical algorithms. And again, this whole quest really started with Avi’s joke.
A year after my and Arkhipov’s work, I noticed that one also can run the connection between quantum optics and the permanent in the “reverse” direction. In other words: with BosonSampling, we used the famous theorem of Valiant, that the permanent is #P-complete, to help us argue that bosons can solve hard sampling problems. But if we know by some other means that quantum optics lets us encode #P-complete problems, then we can use that to give an independent, “quantum” proof that the permanent is #P-complete in the first place! As it happens, there is another way to see why quantum optics lets us encode #P-complete problems. Namely, we can use celebrated work by Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn (KLM) from 2001, which showed how to perform universal quantum computation using quantum optics with the one additional resource of “feed-forward measurements.” With minor modifications, the construction by KLM also lets us encode a #P-complete problem into a bosonic amplitude, which we know is a permanent—thereby proving that the permanent is #P-complete, in what I personally regard as a much more intuitive way than Valiant’s original approach based on cycle covers. This illustrates a theme that we’ve seen over and over in the last 13 years or so, which is the use of quantum methods and arguments to gain insight even about classical computation.
Admittedly, I wasn’t proving anything here in classical complexity theory that wasn’t already known, just giving a different proof for an old result! Extremely recently, however, my students Daniel Grier and Luke Schaeffer have extended my argument based on quantum optics, to show that computing the permanent of a unitary or orthogonal matrix is #P-complete. (Indeed, even over finite fields of characteristic k, computing the permanent of an orthogonal matrix is a ModkP-complete problem, as long as k is not 2 or 3—which turns out to be the tight answer.) This is not a result that we previously knew by any means, whether quantum or classical.
I can’t resist telling you the biggest theoretical open problem that arose from my and Arkhipov’s work. We would like to say: even if you had a polynomial-time algorithm that sampled a probability distribution that was merely close, in variation distance, to the BosonSampling distribution, that would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. But we’re only able to prove that assuming a certain problem is #P-complete, which no one has been able to prove #P-complete. That problem is the following:
Given an n×n matrix A, each of whose entries is an i.i.d. complex Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1 (that is, drawn from N(0,1)C), estimate |Per(A)|2, to within additive error ±ε·n!, with probability at least 1-δ over the choice of A. Do this in time polynomial in n, 1/ε, and 1/δ.
Note that, if you care about exactly computing the permanent of a Gaussian random matrix, or about approximating the permanent of an arbitrary matrix, we know how to prove both of those problems #P-complete. The difficulty “only” arises when we combine approximation and average-case in the same problem.
At the moment, we don’t even know something more basic, which is: what’s the distribution over |Per(A)|2, when A is an n×n matrix of i.i.d. N(0,1)C Gaussians? Based on numerical evidence, we conjecture that the distribution converges to lognormal as n gets large. By using the interpretation of the determinant as the volume of a parallelipiped, we can prove that the distribution over |Det(A)|2 converges to lognormal. And the distribution over |Per(A)|2 looks almost the same when you plot it. But not surprisingly, the permanent is harder to analyze.
This brings me to my final vignette. Why would anyone even suspect that approximating the permanent of a Gaussian random matrix would be a #P-hard problem? Well, because if you look at the permanent of an n×n matrix over a large enough finite field, say Fp, that function famously has the property of random self-reducibility. This means: the ability to calculate such a permanent in polynomial time, on 90% all matrices in Fpn×n, or even for that matter on only 1% of them, implies the ability to calculate it in polynomial time on every such matrix.
The reason for this is simply that the permanent is a low-degree polynomial, and low-degree polynomials have extremely useful error-correcting properties. In particular, if you can compute such a polynomial on any large fraction of points, then you can do noisy polynomial interpolation (e.g., the Berlekamp-Welch algorithm, or list decoding), in order to get the value of the polynomial on an arbitrary point.
I don’t specifically remember Avi talking about the random self-reducibility of the permanent in his 2000 lecture, but he obviously would have talked about it! And it was really knowing about the random self-reducibility of the permanent, and how powerful it was, that led me and Alex Arkhipov to the study of BosonSampling in the first place.
In complexity theory, the random self-reducibility of the permanent is hugely important because it was sort of the spark for some of our most convincing examples of non-relativizing results—that is, results that fail relative to a suitable oracle. The most famous such result is that #P, and for that matter even PSPACE, admit interactive protocols (the IP=PSPACE theorem). In the 1970s, Baker, Gill, and Solovay pointed out that non-relativizing methods would be needed to resolve P vs. NP and many of the other great problems of the field.
In 2007, Avi and I wrote our only joint paper so far. In that paper, we decided to take a closer look at the non-relativizing results based on interactive proofs. We said: while it’s true that these results don’t relativize—that is, there are oracles relative to which they fail—nevertheless, these results hold relative to all oracles that themselves encode low-degree polynomials over finite fields (such as the permanent). So, introducing a term, Avi and I said that results like IP=PSPACE algebrize.
But then we also showed that, if you want to prove P≠NP—or for that matter, even prove circuit lower bounds that go “slightly” beyond what’s already known (such as NEXP⊄P/poly)—you’ll need techniques that are not only non-relativizing, but also non-algebrizing. So in some sense, the properties of the permanent that are used (for example) in proving that it has an interactive protocol, just “aren’t prying the black box open wide enough.”
I have a more recent result, from 2011 or so, that I never got around to finishing a paper about. In this newer work, I decided to take another look at the question: what is it about the permanent that actually fails to relativize? And I prove the following result: relative to an arbitrary oracle A, the class #P has complete problems that are both random self-reducible and downward self-reducible (that is, reducible to smaller instances of the same problem). So, contrary to what certainly I and maybe others had often thought, it’s not the random self-reducibility of the permanent that’s the crucial thing about it. What’s important, instead, is a further property that the permanent has, of being self-checkable and self-correctible.
In other words: given (say) a noisy circuit for the permanent, it’s not just that you can correct that circuit to compute whichever low-degree polynomial it was close to computing. Rather, it’s that you can confirm that the polynomial is in fact the permanent, and nothing else.
I like the way Ketan Mulmuley thinks about this phenomenon in his Geometric Complexity Theory, which is a speculative, audacious program to try to prove that the permanent is harder than the determinant, and to tackle the other great separation questions of complexity theory (including P vs. NP), by using algebraic geometry and representation theory. Mulmuley says: the permanent is a polynomial in the entries of an n×n matrix that not only satisfies certain symmetries (e.g., under interchanging rows or columns), but is uniquely characterized by those symmetries. In other words, if you find a polynomial that passes certain tests—for example, if it behaves in the right way under rescaling and interchanging rows and columns—then that polynomial must be the permanent, or a scalar multiple of the permanent. Similarly, if you find a polynomial that passes the usual interactive proof for the permanent, that polynomial must be the permanent. I think this goes a long way toward explaining why the permanent is so special: it’s not just any hard-to-compute, low-degree polynomial; it’s one that you can recognize when you come across it.
I’ve now told you about the eventual impact of one single survey talk that Avi gave 16 years ago—not even a particularly major or important one. So you can only imagine what Avi’s impact must have been on all of us, if you integrate over all the talks he’s given and papers he’s written and young people he’s mentored and connections he’s made his entire career. May that impact be permanent.",34063,"['092f452b4aedbb43740abe796d831089c8c0f4bfe323e41bd8b849c0d4beaf51', '1d5848b17e253216c3444319a661cb870b1a5e844c398103d66e6ab0ef00a3ae', '2d6c059372c42fa752fa1c7083d7208df59e22eb47942a6705bc268b5f141a2a', 'c8c9217476606324ff384d102674162b0dc79581c0c01821440450b002d69cb2', '55e3b78891c36fd91d195b41dabeec4bf428bba9e67c1eceabc90ce8b32571c2', '8dec000e699fa76118af708b371e0566297953103f32764478a6bef6d83d2fdf', '6c50f2396ac3c3916fd28d8454edf32f2ba648aac5a6019e271c6350a2877f44', '80435d6404e632fdb5a1d55ec31063a1d623634033bb862e5731f546179b59a4', 'e7b426ef1455a15541357576e20da96d1a18dc4fd3c019c4d774daf5e9c90f38', 'eefd24c8bef6a2669ab8bb820643ac53c9b1d4eaf0d16f8519a282b02379819d', 'eb5d4b7070c7fc305b10fcb2f3038b9cea651f5fce92995a357854ae55329b34', '503e040c8ed9683f236795b7474ee9df69543f5b2d0749544b6aa427e0666c2f', '9a23b2e8ce23b467b8ce4bed0b4401e467f1cbab9ebaee51bce2d07db2b26644', '93d625c1a5ff0284135e2231f731bbe6e448c54f4204d8ec4dc6a8ff8d925ba8', 'b9827d447205fa67f0a3f1cc0a7e2a410a1312f3fd420d329b00b1b0c2bff4fd', 'b9edecc61892fb518a07c2865a53093b9f3eeca943845d397a9f75b49c08adc5', 'f65647eb6408232f9f03365dcd40c3212f0041b4568e49ed30a4a21278687ddd', '750e2d2c9a8891934b2dbb932ef9d5395bf427af61b3b9361257eaee18aa14af', 'd1ad7efc735dec89cfc3daf3c8540f13c8b62d6809fb3c488750a3913be80cb7', 'ed1ffab34a1c18954b1264d607bef7ee4cd954bfc580482f56ba1bea7fc99243', '66787726b495a270b84270c8b43f671d6be2239411b6b3fcc474ca6909fcaa04', '089c8ce46cbb8dc417b9e78de80cc7ded67cd3310fa630f0939741398f2a3d19', 'cc67f41591780b197aaa4aec378776d7dd3801fb7e6cde5a6e8ad893ab08b7a1', '779635aebb95976b4de47ba412bd7cb600a1d798a614b5a1a5584cceda43921e', '6b66d896451ecd0ea764f42723d5f521787bb05c535deaa7eda42e698490fc15', 'a849a7bbc8b8f45ffebff2eace26c10070021e43e0c53bc880af5ea0ee75e901', 'f68806dc27e839c1e752a07ccd425c33c7999996dc74cf7f5a694d9da03d3b0d', '2aabc02d9c00e14eef2892decc194d238f10269ab41d24d2c4b8a2d443e95a23', 'a68b148c0af2c82ef2dd738f64348cb10429964e3c0a64c1132eb89b30a2f670', '412bf6f6e5bbaae2a67dcff59ef1652e8e8130c5479e90b4908ce80cb2644b7f', '01cdcf4d38a780a0118398c932e1f5fc305993007f5f068a60fd7334eb6646b8', 'b8750910014cacb5040d08763b53f8142c41e02e237eca600126564bee57c34a', 'b782e68016d53bf3f103e6321b592124ac7c4bac245184b6b4d23f0dc4d075aa', '792458bf9650cc54407d1bb4dd6991d4ff46a59fc01a0bfaa3bd06f8f4089926', '1d95f0726213c9d5d58b391f555ebfdedd16d6ed2d1b3859215dc2998a1ff12c', 'eaff7c92c77dac2ff481603abc7958c002b49f406d795b94fd367da5636de504', '8a9acdae918736a1c92b591eded8a3eef3fa7e1ef41debea50429b77d0f3e5f0']"
131,2903,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2903,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2016-09-19,Scott Aaronson,The No-Cloning Theorem and the Human Condition: My After-Dinner Talk at QCRYPT,"The following are the after-dinner remarks that I delivered at QCRYPT’2016, the premier quantum cryptography conference, on Thursday Sep. 15 in Washington DC. You could compare to my after-dinner remarks at QIP’2006 to see how much I’ve “”matured”” since then. Thanks so much to Yi-Kai Liu and the other organizers for inviting me and for putting on a really fantastic conference.
It’s wonderful to be here at QCRYPT among so many friends—this is the first significant conference I’ve attended since I moved from MIT to Texas. I do, however, need to register a complaint with the organizers, which is: why wasn’t I allowed to bring my concealed firearm to the conference? You know, down in Texas, we don’t look too kindly on you academic elitists in Washington DC telling us what to do, who we can and can’t shoot and so forth. Don’t mess with Texas! As you might’ve heard, many of us Texans even support a big, beautiful, physical wall being built along our border with Mexico. Personally, though, I don’t think the wall proposal goes far enough. Forget about illegal immigration and smuggling: I don’t even want Americans and Mexicans to be able to win the CHSH game with probability exceeding 3/4. Do any of you know what kind of wall could prevent that? Maybe a metaphysical wall.
OK, but that’s not what I wanted to talk about. When Yi-Kai asked me to give an after-dinner talk, I wasn’t sure whether to try to say something actually relevant to quantum cryptography or just make jokes. So I’ll do something in between: I’ll tell you about research directions in quantum cryptography that are also jokes.
The subject of this talk is a deep theorem that stands as one of the crowning achievements of our field. I refer, of course, to the No-Cloning Theorem. Almost everything we’re talking about at this conference, from QKD onwards, is based in some way on quantum states being unclonable. If you read Stephen Wiesner’s paper from 1968, which founded quantum cryptography, the No-Cloning Theorem already played a central role—although Wiesner didn’t call it that. By the way, here’s my #1 piece of research advice to the students in the audience: if you want to become immortal, just find some fact that everyone already knows and give it a name!
I’d like to pose the question: why should our universe be governed by physical laws that make the No-Cloning Theorem true? I mean, it’s possible that there’s some other reason for our universe to be quantum-mechanical, and No-Cloning is just a byproduct of that. No-Cloning would then be like the armpit of quantum mechanics: not there because it does anything useful, but just because there’s gotta be something under your arms.
OK, but No-Cloning feels really fundamental. One of my early memories is when I was 5 years old or so, and utterly transfixed by my dad’s home fax machine, one of those crappy 1980s fax machines with wax paper. I kept thinking about it: is it really true that a piece of paper gets transmaterialized, sent through a wire, and reconstituted at the other location? Could I have been that wrong about how the universe works? Until finally I got it—and once you get it, it’s hard even to recapture your original confusion, because it becomes so obvious that the world is made not of stuff but of copyable bits of information. “Information wants to be free!”
The No-Cloning Theorem represents nothing less than a partial return to the view of the world that I had before I was five. It says that quantum information doesn’t want to be free: it wants to be private. There is, it turns out, a kind of information that’s tied to a particular place, or set of places. It can be moved around, or even teleported, but it can’t be copied the way a fax machine copies bits.
So I think it’s worth at least entertaining the possibility that we don’t have No-Cloning because of quantum mechanics; we have quantum mechanics because of No-Cloning—or because quantum mechanics is the simplest, most elegant theory that has unclonability as a core principle. But if so, that just pushes the question back to: why should unclonability be a core principle of physics?
Quantum Key Distribution
A first suggestion about this question came from Gilles Brassard, who’s here. Years ago, I attended a talk by Gilles in which he speculated that the laws of quantum mechanics are what they are because Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has to be possible, while bit commitment has to be impossible. If true, that would be awesome for the people at this conference. It would mean that, far from being this exotic competitor to RSA and Diffie-Hellman that’s distance-limited and bandwidth-limited and has a tiny market share right now, QKD would be the entire reason why the universe is as it is! Or maybe what this really amounts to is an appeal to the Anthropic Principle. Like, if QKD hadn’t been possible, then we wouldn’t be here at QCRYPT to talk about it.
Quantum Money
But maybe we should search more broadly for the reasons why our laws of physics satisfy a No-Cloning Theorem. Wiesner’s paper sort of hinted at QKD, but the main thing it had was a scheme for unforgeable quantum money. This is one of the most direct uses imaginable for the No-Cloning Theorem: to store economic value in something that it’s physically impossible to copy. So maybe that’s the reason for No-Cloning: because God wanted us to have e-commerce, and didn’t want us to have to bother with blockchains (and certainly not with credit card numbers).
The central difficulty with quantum money is: how do you authenticate a bill as genuine? (OK, fine, there’s also the dificulty of how to keep a bill coherent in your wallet for more than a microsecond or whatever. But we’ll leave that for the engineers.)
In Wiesner’s original scheme, he solved the authentication problem by saying that, whenever you want to verify a quantum bill, you bring it back to the bank that printed it. The bank then looks up the bill’s classical serial number in a giant database, which tells the bank in which basis to measure each of the bill’s qubits.
With this system, you can actually get information-theoretic security against counterfeiting. OK, but the fact that you have to bring a bill to the bank to be verified negates much of the advantage of quantum money in the first place. If you’re going to keep involving a bank, then why not just use a credit card?
That’s why over the past decade, some of us have been working on public-key quantum money: that is, quantum money that anyone can verify. For this kind of quantum money, it’s easy to see that the No-Cloning Theorem is no longer enough: you also need some cryptographic assumption. But OK, we can consider that. In recent years, we’ve achieved glory by proposing a huge variety of public-key quantum money schemes—and we’ve achieved even greater glory by breaking almost all of them!
After a while, there were basically two schemes left standing: one based on knot theory by Ed Farhi, Peter Shor, et al. That one has been proven to be secure under the assumption that it can’t be broken. The second scheme, which Paul Christiano and I proposed in 2012, is based on hidden subspaces encoded by multivariate polynomials. For our scheme, Paul and I were able to do better than Farhi et al.: we gave a security reduction. That is, we proved that our quantum money scheme is secure, unless there’s a polynomial-time quantum algorithm to find hidden subspaces encoded by low-degree multivariate polynomials (yadda yadda, you can look up the details) with much greater success probability than we thought possible.
Today, the situation is that my and Paul’s security proof remains completely valid, but meanwhile, our money is completely insecure! Our reduction means the opposite of what we thought it did. There is a break of our quantum money scheme, and as a consequence, there’s also a quantum algorithm to find large subspaces hidden by low-degree polynomials with much better success probability than we’d thought. What happened was that first, some French algebraic cryptanalysts—Faugere, Pena, I can’t pronounce their names—used Gröbner bases to break the noiseless version of scheme, in classical polynomial time. So I thought, phew! At least I had acceded when Paul insisted that we also include a noisy version of the scheme. But later, Paul noticed that there’s a quantum reduction from the problem of breaking our noisy scheme to the problem of breaking the noiseless one, so the former is broken as well.
I’m choosing to spin this positively: “we used quantum money to discover a striking new quantum algorithm for finding subspaces hidden by low-degree polynomials. Err, yes, that’s exactly what we did.”
But, bottom line, until we manage to invent a better public-key quantum money scheme, or otherwise sort this out, I don’t think we’re entitled to claim that God put unclonability into our universe in order for quantum money to be possible.
Copy-Protected Quantum Software
So if not money, then what about its cousin, copy-protected software—could that be why No-Cloning holds? By copy-protected quantum software, I just mean a quantum state that, if you feed it into your quantum computer, lets you evaluate some Boolean function on any input of your choice, but that doesn’t let you efficiently prepare more states that let the same function be evaluated. I think this is important as one of the preeminent evil applications of quantum information. Why should nuclear physicists and genetic engineers get a monopoly on the evil stuff?
OK, but is copy-protected quantum software even possible? The first worry you might have is that, yeah, maybe it’s possible, but then every time you wanted to run the quantum program, you’d have to make a measurement that destroyed it. So then you’d have to go back and buy a new copy of the program for the next run, and so on. Of course, to the software company, this would presumably be a feature rather than a bug!
But as it turns out, there’s a fact many of you know—sometimes called the “Gentle Measurement Lemma,” other times the “Almost As Good As New Lemma”—which says that, as long as the outcome of your measurement on a quantum state could be predicted almost with certainty given knowledge of the state, the measurement can be implemented in such a way that it hardly damages the state at all. This tells us that, if quantum money, copy-protected quantum software, and the other things we’re talking about are possible at all, then they can also be made reusable. I summarize the principle as: “if rockets, then space shuttles.”
Much like with quantum money, one can show that, relative to a suitable oracle, it’s possible to quantumly copy-protect any efficiently computable function—or rather, any function that’s hard to learn from its input/output behavior. Indeed, the implementation can be not only copy-protected but also obfuscated, so that the user learns nothing besides the input/output behavior. As Bill Fefferman pointed out in his talk this morning, the No-Cloning Theorem lets us bypass Barak et al.’s famous result on the impossibility of obfuscation, because their impossibility proof assumed the ability to copy the obfuscated program.
Of course, what we really care about is whether quantum copy-protection is possible in the real world, with no oracle. I was able to give candidate implementations of quantum copy-protection for extremely special functions, like one that just checks the validity of a password. In the general case—that is, for arbitrary programs—Paul Christiano has a beautiful proposal for how to do it, which builds on our hidden-subspace money scheme. Unfortunately, since our money scheme is currently in the shop being repaired, it’s probably premature to think about the security of the much more complicated copy-protection scheme! But these are wonderful open problems, and I encourage any of you to come and scoop us. Once we know whether uncopyable quantum software is possible at all, we could then debate whether it’s the “reason” for our universe to have unclonability as a core principle.
Unclonable Proofs and Advice
Along the same lines, I can’t resist mentioning some favorite research directions, which some enterprising student here could totally turn into a talk at next year’s QCRYPT.
Firstly, what can we say about clonable versus unclonable quantum proofs—that is, QMA witness states? In other words: for which problems in QMA can we ensure that there’s an accepting witness that lets you efficiently create as many additional accepting witnesses as you want? (I mean, besides the QCMA problems, the ones that have short classical witnesses?) For which problems in QMA can we ensure that there’s an accepting witness that doesn’t let you efficiently create any additional accepting witnesses? I do have a few observations about these questions—ask me if you’re interested—but on the whole, I believe almost anything one can ask about them remains open.
Admittedly, it’s not clear how much use an unclonable proof would be. Like, imagine a quantum state that encoded a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, and which you would keep in your bedroom, in a glass orb on your nightstand or something. And whenever you felt your doubts about the Riemann Hypothesis resurfacing, you’d take the state out of its orb and measure it again to reassure yourself of RH’s truth. You’d be like, “my preciousssss!” And no one else could copy your state and thereby gain the same Riemann-faith-restoring powers that you had. I dunno, I probably won’t hawk this application in a DARPA grant.
Similarly, one can ask about clonable versus unclonable quantum advice states—that is, initial states that are given to you to boost your computational power beyond that of an ordinary quantum computer. And that’s also a fascinating open problem.
OK, but maybe none of this quite gets at why our universe has unclonability. And this is an after-dinner talk, so do you want me to get to the really crazy stuff? Yes?
Self-Referential Paradoxes
OK! What if unclonability is our universe’s way around the paradoxes of self-reference, like the unsolvability of the halting problem and Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem? Allow me to explain what I mean.
In kindergarten or wherever, we all learn Turing’s proof that there’s no computer program to solve the halting problem. But what isn’t usually stressed is that that proof actually does more than advertised. If someone hands you a program that they claim solves the halting problem, Turing doesn’t merely tell you that that person is wrong—rather, he shows you exactly how to expose the person as a jackass, by constructing an example input on which their program fails. All you do is, you take their claimed halt-decider, modify it in some simple way, and then feed the result back to the halt-decider as input. You thereby create a situation where, if your program halts given its own code as input, then it must run forever, and if it runs forever then it halts. “WHOOOOSH!” [head-exploding gesture]
OK, but now imagine that the program someone hands you, which they claim solves the halting problem, is a quantum program. That is, it’s a quantum state, which you measure in some basis depending on the program you’re interested in, in order to decide whether that program halts. Well, the truth is, this quantum program still can’t work to solve the halting problem. After all, there’s some classical program that simulates the quantum one, albeit less efficiently, and we already know that the classical program can’t work.
But now consider the question: how would you actually produce an example input on which this quantum program failed to solve the halting problem? Like, suppose the program worked on every input you tried. Then ultimately, to produce a counterexample, you might need to follow Turing’s proof and make a copy of the claimed quantum halt-decider. But then, of course, you’d run up against the No-Cloning Theorem!
So we seem to arrive at the conclusion that, while of course there’s no quantum program to solve the halting problem, there might be a quantum program for which no one could explicitly refute that it solved the halting problem, by giving a counterexample.
I was pretty excited about this observation for a day or two, until I noticed the following. Let’s suppose your quantum program that allegedly solves the halting problem has n qubits. Then it’s possible to prove that the program can’t possibly be used to compute more than, say, 2n bits of Chaitin’s constant Ω, which is the probability that a random program halts. OK, but if we had an actual oracle for the halting problem, we could use it to compute as many bits of Ω as we wanted. So, suppose I treated my quantum program as if it were an oracle for the halting problem, and I used it to compute the first 2n bits of Ω. Then I would know that, assuming the truth of quantum mechanics, the program must have made a mistake somewhere. There would still be something weird, which is that I wouldn’t know on which input my program had made an error—I would just know that it must’ve erred somewhere! With a bit of cleverness, one can narrow things down to two inputs, such that the quantum halt-decider must have erred on at least one of them. But I don’t know whether it’s possible to go further, and concentrate the wrongness on a single query.
We can play a similar game with other famous applications of self-reference. For example, suppose we use a quantum state to encode a system of axioms. Then that system of axioms will still be subject to Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem (which I guess I believe despite the umlaut). If it’s consistent, it won’t be able to prove all the true statements of arithmetic. But we might never be able to produce an explicit example of a true statement that the axioms don’t prove. To do so we’d have to clone the state encoding the axioms and thereby violate No-Cloning.

But since I’m a bit drunk, I should confess that all this stuff about Gödel and self-reference is just a warmup to what I really wanted to talk about, which is whether the No-Cloning Theorem might have anything to do with the mysteries of personal identity and “free will.” I first encountered this idea in Roger Penrose’s book, The Emperor’s New Mind. But I want to stress that I’m not talking here about the possibility that the brain is a quantum computer—much less about the possibility that it’s a quantum-gravitational hypercomputer that uses microtubules to solve the halting problem! I might be drunk, but I’m not that drunk. I also think that the Penrose-Lucas argument, based on Gödel’s Theorem, for why the brain has to work that way is fundamentally flawed.
But here I’m talking about something different. See, I have a lot of friends in the Singularity / Friendly AI movement. And I talk to them whenever I pass through the Bay Area, which is where they congregate. And many of them express great confidence that before too long—maybe in 20 or 30 years, maybe in 100 years—we’ll be able to upload ourselves to computers and live forever on the Internet (as opposed to just living 70% of our lives on the Internet, like we do today).
This would have lots of advantages. For example, any time you were about to do something dangerous, you’d just make a backup copy of yourself first. If you were struggling with a conference deadline, you’d spawn 100 temporary copies of yourself. If you wanted to visit Mars or Jupiter, you’d just email yourself there. If Trump became president, you’d not run yourself for 8 years (or maybe 80 or 800 years). And so on.
Admittedly, some awkward questions arise. For example, let’s say the hardware runs three copies of your code and takes a majority vote, just for error-correcting purposes. Does that bring three copies of you into existence, or only one copy? Or let’s say your code is run homomorphically encrypted, with the only decryption key stored in another galaxy. Does that count? Or you email yourself to Mars. If you want to make sure that you’ll wake up on Mars, is it important that you delete the copy of your code that remains on earth? Does it matter whether anyone runs the code or not? And what exactly counts as “running” it? Or my favorite one: could someone threaten you by saying, “look, I have a copy of your code, and if you don’t do what I say, I’m going to make a thousand copies of it and subject them all to horrible tortures?”
The issue, in all these cases, is that in a world where there could be millions of copies of your code running on different substrates in different locations—or things where it’s not even clear whether they count as a copy or not—we don’t have a principled way to take as input a description of the state of the universe, and then identify where in the universe you are—or even a probability distribution over places where you could be. And yet you seem to need such a way in order to make predictions and decisions.
A few years ago, I wrote this gigantic, post-tenure essay called The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine, where I tried to make the point that we don’t know at what level of granularity a brain would need to be simulated in order to duplicate someone’s subjective identity. Maybe you’d only need to go down to the level of neurons and synapses. But if you needed to go all the way down to the molecular level, then the No-Cloning Theorem would immediately throw a wrench into most of the paradoxes of personal identity that we discussed earlier.
For it would mean that there were some microscopic yet essential details about each of us that were fundamentally uncopyable, localized to a particular part of space. We would all, in effect, be quantumly copy-protected software. Each of us would have a core of unpredictability—not merely probabilistic unpredictability, like that of a quantum random number generator, but genuine unpredictability—that an external model of us would fail to capture completely. Of course, by having futuristic nanorobots scan our brains and so forth, it would be possible in principle to make extremely realistic copies of us. But those copies necessarily wouldn’t capture quite everything. And, one can speculate, maybe not enough for your subjective experience to “transfer over.”
Maybe the most striking aspect of this picture is that sure, you could teleport yourself to Mars—but to do so you’d need to use quantum teleportation, and as we all know, quantum teleportation necessarily destroys the original copy of the teleported state. So we’d avert this metaphysical crisis about what to do with the copy that remained on Earth.
Look—I don’t know if any of you are like me, and have ever gotten depressed by reflecting that all of your life experiences, all your joys and sorrows and loves and losses, every itch and flick of your finger, could in principle be encoded by a huge but finite string of bits, and therefore by a single positive integer. (Really? No one else gets depressed about that?) It’s kind of like: given that this integer has existed since before there was a universe, and will continue to exist after the universe has degenerated into a thin gruel of radiation, what’s the point of even going through the motions? You know?
But the No-Cloning Theorem raises the possibility that at least this integer is really your integer. At least it’s something that no one else knows, and no one else could know in principle, even with futuristic brain-scanning technology: you’ll always be able to surprise the world with a new digit. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but if it were true, then it seems like the sort of thing that would be worthy of elevating unclonability to a fundamental principle of the universe.
So as you enjoy your dinner and dessert at this historic Mayflower Hotel, I ask you to reflect on the following. People can photograph this event, they can video it, they can type up transcripts, in principle they could even record everything that happens down to the millimeter level, and post it on the Internet for posterity. But they’re not gonna get the quantum states. There’s something about this evening, like about every evening, that will vanish forever, so please savor it while it lasts. Thank you.
Update (Sep. 20): Unbeknownst to me, Marc Kaplan did video the event and put it up on YouTube! Click here to watch. Thanks very much to Marc! I hope you enjoy, even though of course, the video can’t precisely clone the experience of having been there.

132,2854,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2854,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2016-07-29,Scott Aaronson,More Wrong Things I Said in Papers,"Two years ago, I wrote a blog post entitled PostBQP Postscripts, owning up to not one but four substantive mathematical errors that I’d made over the years in my published papers, and which my students and colleagues later brought to my sheepish attention. Fortunately, none of these errors affected the papers’ main messages; they just added interesting new twists to the story. Even so, I remember feeling at the time like undergoing this public repentance was soul-cleansing intellectual hygiene. I also felt like writing one big “post of shame” was easier than writing a bunch of separate errata and submitting them to journals, while also reaching a wider audience (and, therefore, doing an even better soul-cleansing job).
So I resolved that, anytime I’d saved up enough errata, I’d do another sackcloth-and-ashes post. Which brings us to today. Without further ado:
I. Quantum Money Falling Down
My and Paul Christiano’s explicit public-key quantum money scheme—the one based on low-degree polynomials—has now been fully broken. To clarify, our abstract hidden-subspace scheme—the one that uses a classical black-box to test membership in the subspaces—remains totally fine. Indeed, we unconditionally proved the security of the black-box scheme, and our security proof stands. In the paper, though, we also stuck our necks out further, and conjectured that you could instantiate the black box, by publishing random low-degree polynomials that vanish on the subspaces you want to hide. While I considered this superfluous, at Paul’s insistence, we also recommended adding completely-random “noise polynomials” for extra security.
Our scheme was broken in two stages. First, in 2014, Pena et al. broke the noiseless version of our scheme, using Gröbner-basis methods, over fields of characteristic greater than 2. Over F2—the field we happened to use in our scheme—Pena et al. couldn’t quite prove that their attack worked, but they gave numerical evidence that at least it finds the subspaces in nO(log n) time. Note that nothing in Pena et al.’s attack is specific to quantum money: indeed, their attack consists of a purely classical algorithm, which efficiently solves the general classical problem of recovering large subspaces from polynomials that hide them.
At that point, at least the noisy version of our scheme—the one Paul had insisted we include—was still standing! Indeed, the Gröbner-basis attack seemed to break down entirely when some of the polynomials were random garbage.
Later, though, Paul and Or Sattath realized that a quantum trick—basically, the single-copy tomography of Farhi et al.—can identify which polynomials are the noisy ones, provided we’re given a legitimate quantum money state to start with. As a consequence, the problem of breaking the noisy scheme can be reduced to the problem of breaking the noiseless scheme—i.e., the problem that Pena et al. already essentially solved.
As bad as this sounds, it has an interesting positive consequence. In our paper, Paul and I had actually given a security reduction for our money scheme based on low-degree polynomials. In particular, we showed that there’s no polynomial-time quantum algorithm to counterfeit our money states, unless there’s a polynomial-time quantum algorithm that finds a basis for a subspace S≤F2n of dimension n/2 with Ω(2-n/2) success probability, given a collection of low-degree polynomials p1,…,pm and q1,…,qm (m=O(n)) most of which vanish on S and its dual subspace respectively, but that are otherwise random. So, running our reduction backwards, the only possible conclusion from the break is that there is such a quantum algorithm! Yet we would’ve had no idea how to find that quantum algorithm without going through quantum money—nor do we know a classical algorithm for the problem, or even a quantum algorithm with Ω(1) success probability.
In the meantime, the problem of designing a public-key quantum money scheme, with good cryptographic evidence for its security, remains open. It’s plausible that there’s some other, more secure way to instantiate my and Paul’s hidden subspace scheme, for example using lattices. And even before we’ve found such a way, we can use indistinguishability obfuscation as a stopgap. We could also seek cryptographic evidence for the security of other kinds of public-key quantum money, like Farhi et al.’s based on knot invariants.
A paper about all this is on our to-do stack. In the meantime, for further details, see Lecture 9 in my Barbados lecture notes.
II. A De-Merlinization Mistake
In my 2006 paper QMA/qpoly ⊆ PSPACE/poly: De-Merlinizing Quantum Protocols, the technical core of the complexity result was a new quantum information lemma that I called the “Quantum OR Bound” (Lemma 14 in the paper).
Basically, the Quantum OR Bound says that, if we have an unknown quantum state ρ, as well as a collection of measurements M1,…,Mn that we might want to make on ρ, then we can distinguish the case that (a) every Mi rejects ρ with overwhelming probability, from the case that (b) at least one Mi accepts ρ with high probability. And we can do this despite having only one copy of ρ, and despite the fact that earlier measurements might corrupt ρ, thereby compromising the later measurements. The intuition is simply that, if the earlier measurements corrupted ρ substantially, that could only be because some of them had a decent probability of accepting ρ, meaning that at any rate, we’re not in case (a).
I’ve since reused the Quantum OR Bound for other problems—most notably, a proof that private-key quantum money requires either a computational assumption or a huge database maintained by the bank (see Theorem 8.3.1 in my Barbados lecture notes).
Alas, Aram Harrow and Ashley Montanaro recently discovered that my proof of the Quantum OR Bound is wrong. It’s wrong because I neglected the possibility of “Zeno-like behavior,” in which repeated measurements on a quantum state would gradually shift the state far away from its starting point, without ever having a significant probability of rejecting the state. For some reason, I assumed without any adequate argument that choosing the measurements at random, rather than in a predetermined order, would solve that problem.
Now, I might actually be right that randomizing the measurements is enough to solve the Zeno problem! That remains a plausible conjecture, which Harrow and Montanaro could neither confirm nor refute. In the meantime, though, Harrow and Montanaro were able to recover my QMA/qpoly⊆PSPACE/poly theorem, and all the other conclusions known to follow from the Quantum OR Bound (including some new ones that they discover), by designing a new measurement procedure whose soundness they can prove.
Their new procedure is based on an elegant, obvious-in-retrospect idea that somehow never occurred to me. Namely, instead of just applying Mi‘s to ρ, one can first put a control qubit into an equal superposition of the |0〉 and |1〉 states, and then apply Mi‘s conditioned on the control qubit being in the |1〉 state. While doing this, one can periodically measure the control qubit in the {|+〉,|-〉} basis, in order to check directly whether applying the Mi‘s has substantially corrupted ρ. (If it hasn’t, one will always get the outcome |+〉; if it has, one might get |-〉.) Substantial corruption, if detected, then tells us that some Mi‘s must have had non-negligible probabilities of accepting ρ.
III. Almost As Good As True
One lemma that I’ve used even more than the Quantum OR Bound is what I’ve called the “Almost As Good As New Lemma,” and what others in the field have called the “Gentle Measurement Lemma.”
I claimed a proof of the AAGANL in my 2004 paper Limitations of Quantum Advice and One-Way Communication (Lemma 2.2 there), and have used the lemma in like half a dozen later papers. Alas, when I lectured at Barbados, Sasha Razborov and others discovered that my proof of the AAGANL was missing a crucial step! More concretely, the proof I gave there works for pure states but not for mixed states. For mixed states, the trouble is that I take a purification of the mixed state—something that always exists mathematically—but then illegally assume that the measurement I’m analyzing acts on the particular purification I’ve conjured up.
Fortunately, one can easily fix this problem by decomposing the state ρ into a mixture of pure states, then applying my earlier argument to each pure state separately, and finally using Cauchy-Schwarz (or just the convexity of the square-root function) to recombine the results. Moreover, this is exactly what other people’s proofs of the Gentle Measurement Lemma did do, though I’d never noticed it before Barbados—I just idly wondered why those other proofs took twice as long as mine to do the same work! For a correct proof, see Lemma 1.3.1 in the Barbados lecture notes.
IV. Oracle Woes
In my 2010 paper BQP and the Polynomial Hierarchy, I claimed to construct oracles A relative to which BQP⊄BPPpath and BQP⊄SZK, even while making only partial progress toward the big prize, which would’ve been an oracle relative to which BQP⊄PH. Not only that: I claimed to show that any problem with a property called “almost k-wise independence”—one example being the Forrelation (or Fourier Checking) problem that I introduced in that paper—was neither in BPPpath nor in SZK. But I showed that Forrelation is in BQP, thus yielding the separations.
Alas, this past spring Lijie Chen, who was my superb visiting student from Tsinghua University, realized that my proofs of these particular separations were wrong. Not only that, they were wrong because I implicitly substituted a ratio of expectations for an expectation of ratios (!). Again, it might still be true that almost k-wise independent problems can be neither in BPPpath nor in SZK: that remains an interesting conjecture, which Lijie was unable to resolve one way or the other. (On the other hand, I showed here that almost k-wise independent problems can be in PH.)
But never fear! In a recent arXiv preprint, Lijie has supplied correct proofs for the BQP⊄BPPpath and BQP⊄SZK oracle separations—using the same Forrelation problem that I studied, but additional properties of Forrelation besides its almost k-wise independence. Lijie notes that my proofs, had they worked, would also have yielded an oracle relative to which BQP⊄AM, which would’ve been a spectacular result, nontrivial progress toward BQP⊄PH. His proofs, by contrast, apply only to worst-case decision problems rather than problems of distinguishing two probability distributions, and therefore don’t imply anything about BQP vs. AM. Anyway, there’s other cool stuff in his paper too.
V. We Needed More Coffee
This is one I’ve already written about on this blog, but just in case anyone missed it … in my, Sean Carroll, and Lauren Ouellette’s original draft paper on the coffee automaton, the specific rule we discuss doesn’t generate any significant amount of complexity (in the sense of coarse-grained entropy). We wrongly thought it did, because of a misinterpretation of our simulation data. But as Brent Werness brought to our attention, not only does a corrected simulation not show any complexity bump, one can rigorously prove there’s no complexity bump. And we could’ve realized all this from the beginning, by reflecting that pure random diffusion (e.g., what cream does in coffee when you don’t stir it with a spoon) doesn’t actually produce interesting tendril patterns.
On the other hand, Brent proposed a different rule—one that involves “shearing” whole regions of cream and coffee across each other—that does generate significant complexity, basically because of all the long-range correlations it induces. And not only do we clearly see this in simulations, but the growth of complexity can be rigorously proven! Anyway, we have a long-delayed revision of the paper that will explain all this in more detail, with Brent as well as MIT student Varun Mohan now added as coauthors.

After a long effort—on the part of me, the scribes, the guest lecturers, and the organizers—the 111-page lecture notes are finally available, right here.
Here’s the summary:
If you still haven’t decided whether to tackle this thing: it’s basically a quantum complexity theory textbook (well, a textbook for certain themes within quantum complexity theory) that I’ve written and put on the Internet for free. It has explanations of lots of published results both old and new, but also some results of mine (e.g., about private-key quantum money, firewalls, and AdS/CFT) that I shamefully haven’t yet written up as papers, and that therefore aren’t currently available anywhere else. If you’re interested in certain specific topics—for example, only quantum money, or only firewalls—you should be able to skip around in the notes without too much difficulty.
Thanks so much to Denis Therien for organizing the mini-course, Anil Ada for managing the scribe notes effort, my PhD students Adam Bouland and Luke Schaeffer for their special guest lecture (the last one), and finally, the course attendees for their constant questions and interruptions, and (of course) for scribing.
And in case you were wondering: yes, I’ll do absolutely anything for science, even if it means teaching a weeklong course in Barbados! Lest you consider this a pure island boondoggle, please know that I spent probably 12-14 hours per day either lecturing (in two 3-hour installments) or preparing for the lectures, with little sleep and just occasional dips in the ocean.
And now I’m headed to the Perimeter Institute for their It from Qubit summer school, not at all unrelated to my Barbados lectures.

And no, I don’t know of any interesting sense in which “Einstein killed Schrödinger’s cat,” though arguably there are senses in which Schrödinger’s cat killed Einstein.
The above was, however, the title given to a fun panel discussion that Daniel Harlow, Brian Swingle, and I participated in on Wednesday evening, at the spectacular facility of the New York Academy of Sciences on the 40th floor of 7 World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.

(The link will take you to streaming video of the event, though you’ll need to scroll to 6:30 or so for the thing to start.)
The subject of the panel was the surprising recent connections between quantum information and quantum gravity, something that Daniel, Brian, and I all talked about different aspects of. I admitted at the outset that, not only was I not a real expert on the topic (as Daniel and Brian are), I wasn’t even a physicist, just a computer science humor mercenary or whatever the hell I am. I then proceeded, ironically, to explain the Harlow-Hayden argument for the computational hardness of creating a firewall, despite Harlow sitting right next to me (he chose to focus on something else). I was planning also to discuss Lenny Susskind’s conjecture relating the circuit complexity of quantum states to the AdS/CFT correspondence, but I ran out of time.

135,2820,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2820,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2016-06-20,Scott Aaronson,Entanglement without end,"Today we take a break from this blog’s usual round of topics—free will, consciousness, the Singularity, social justice, Donald Trump—to talk about something really crazy and left-field. Namely, recent research in quantum information.
Earlier this month, William Slofstra, currently a Research Assistant Professor at the IQC in Waterloo, posted a breakthrough paper on the arXiv (yeah, I’m using the b-word again—sue me), which solves one version of a ten-year-old problem in entanglement theory called Tsirelson’s Problem. The problem, in one sentence, asks whether all quantum-mechanical correlations that can be achieved using commuting measurements, can also be achieved using measurements on separate parts of a tensor-product Hilbert space. The answer turns out to be no. (We’ve long known that the two kinds of correlations are identical as long as you stick to finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, but Slofstra shows that they can differ in infinite-dimensional spaces.)
One implication of Slofstra’s result can be stated much more concretely, in terms of two-prover games: those things like the famous Bell/CHSH experiment, where Alice and Bob are put in separate rooms, and get inputs x and y respectively, and then without communicating, have to produce outputs a and b respectively satisfying some relation V(x,y,a,b). We’ve long known examples of two-prover games, like the Mermin-Peres magic square game, that can be won 100% of the time if Alice and Bob share quantum entanglement, but that can’t be won 100% of the time in a classical universe. Slofstra gives the first example of something different: namely, a two-prover game that can be won 100% of the time using commuting measurements in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space—something “formally within the rules of quantum mechanics”—but that can’t be won 100% of the time using any finite number of qubits of entanglement.
(Previously, Leung, Toner, and Watrous had given a simpler example of such a game, but theirs required the referee to exchange quantum messages with Alice and Bob.)
If that’s not enough, Slofstra’s construction also shows that, given as input a description of a two-prover game, it’s undecidable (as in, equivalent to the halting problem) whether Alice and Bob can win the game with certainty using commuting measurements on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Notoriously, quantum computing theorists have been unable to put any upper bound (not even “computable”) on the complexity class MIP*, consisting of languages that admit multi-prover interactive systems with entangled provers—precisely because they’ve been unable to bound how much entanglement the provers might need to implement their optimal strategy. Slofstra’s result helps to explain why this problem has been so vexing. I hasten to add, though, that his result doesn’t imply that MIP* contains anything uncomputable, since it remains plausible that anything Alice and Bob can do with infinite entanglement, they can approximate well enough with a finite amount.
That last remark leads to a further fundamental question, one that Slofstra leaves open. Namely, even if Alice and Bob need infinite entanglement to win Slofstra’s game with certainty, can they at least win it with probability arbitrarily close to 100%, using larger and larger finite amounts of entanglement? More broadly, could there exist a game that was winnable with certainty using infinite entanglement, but with at most (say) 90% probability using any finite amount of entanglement? That problem was shown, by Ozawa (see also Scholz and Werner), to be equivalent to a famous unsolved problem in operator algebras called the Connes embedding problem.
Clarifying the matter further, Slofstra (following earlier authors) points out that there are really four classes of two-prover games in play here:
- Games that can be won with certainty using some fixed, finite amount of entanglement.
- Games that can be won with certainty using an infinite amount of entanglement, but still in a tensor-product Hilbert space, HA⊗HB.
- Games that can be won with probability approaching 1, using an infinite sequence of strategies from class 1, or equivalently (as it turns out) from class 2.
- Games that can be won with certainty using measurements by Alice and Bob on an infinite-dimensional quantum state |ψ〉, where we require all of Alice’s measurements to commute with all of Bob’s, but don’t require |ψ〉 to have a tensor-product structure.
It can be shown that 1 is a subset of 2 is a subset of 3 is a subset of 4. Previously, we didn’t know any of these containments to be strict. Slofstra’s result shows that class 2 differs from class 4—and as a consequence, that class 1 differs from class 4 as well. The Connes embedding problem, which remains open, asks whether 3 differs from 4. It also remains open whether 1 differs from 2 and whether 2 differs from 3.
OK, you ask, but what’s the broader importance of any of this? To me, these problems touch on a question of almost metaphysical significance: namely, what sorts of experimental evidence could possibly bear on whether the universe was discrete or continuous?
Because of the Bekenstein bound from quantum gravity, I’m of the opinion that the Hilbert spaces relevant to our universe are ultimately finite-dimensional—or more concretely, that any bounded physical system can store at most ~1069 qubits per square meter of surface area. And in quantum computing and information, almost everything we care about only requires finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces—the subject of this blog post being a striking exception!
Yet if you take a traditional quantum mechanics course, virtually every example you see will involve infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces—starting with the harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom, and coherent states of light. And indeed, when I’ve banged the drum about finite-dimensional QM being the truly fundamental kind, physicists have often retorted by pointing to one of the very first things they learn: the position/momentum commutation relation, which only makes sense in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Of course, if you tried to probe position/momentum commutation to greater and greater precision, eventually your experiments would run up against the limits of quantum gravity, so this retort doesn’t imply that infinite dimensions actually exist at the machine-code level of the universe. But still: is there some conceivable experiment for which a positive result would show us that Nature wasn’t describable by a finite number of qubits, but only by an infinite number?
A few years ago, Tobias Fritz wrote a lovely paper about precisely that question. He gave an example of an identity—namely,
V-1U2V=U3 implies UV-1UV=V-1UVU
—that holds for all finite dimensional unitary matrices U and V, but fails badly for certain infinite-dimensional ones. He suggested that, if this identity were discovered to fail, then Occam’s Razor would favor an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space for our universe.
Unfortunately, Fritz’s example is open to the same sort of objection that Slofstra’s game is. Namely, as Fritz points out, if the antecedent (V-1U2V=U3) held to excellent precision but not perfectly, then his identity could “fail to within experimental limits,” even if our universe had a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and therefore satisfied his identity.
OK, but suppose that the Connes embedding problem had a negative answer—or equivalently, that there existed a two-prover game G that could be won with certainty using commuting operators, but that couldn’t be won (say) 90% of the time using any finite amount of entanglement. In that case, the believers in a quantumly finite universe, like myself, would have to put some real money on the table, in much the same way the original Bell inequality forced the believers in Einsteinian local hidden variables to put money down. We finitists would have to say that the game G couldn’t be won with certainty in the real world, even though formally, winning G with certainty wouldn’t seem to contradict either quantum mechanics or locality. And if, hypothetically, an experiment showed that G could be won with certainty—or indeed, with any probability bounded above 90%—then our position would’ve been falsified, much like the Bell experiments falsified Einsteinian locality.
So how did Slofstra prove his result? I’ll be brief, since STOC’2016 is happening in Cambridge right now, and I’d like to get over there in time for lunch.
If you like, the key idea is to start with equations that have infinite-dimensional solutions but no finite-dimensional ones. The most famous such equation is the position/momentum commutation relation mentioned earlier, which for our purposes is just the following matrix equation:
AB – BA = I.
This equation can’t be satisfied by any finite-dimensional matrices, since AB and BA have the same trace, so Tr(AB-BA)=0, but Tr(I) is nonzero. But, OK, let A be the infinite-dimensional linear operator that takes as input the coefficients of a polynomial c0+c1x+c2x2+… and that differentiates the polynomial, and let B be the linear operator that multiplies the polynomial by x. Then I invite you to check that the equation holds.
It’s not known at present how to turn the above equation into a two-prover game—I regard it as a fascinating question whether that’s possible. Rather than an algebraic equation (involving both addition and multiplication), Slofstra instead needs to start with group equations (involving only multiplication)—ones with the strange property that they’re satisfied only by the identity matrix or by infinite matrices. Equivalently, he needs a group, defined by a finite list of generators and relations, that admits no nontrivial finite-dimensional matrix representations. Fortunately for him, such groups exist—the first known example being Higman’s group, discovered in 1951. Higman’s group is generated by four elements, a,b,c,d, which satisfy the equations
a-1ba = b2, b-1cb = c2, c-1dc = d2, d-1ad = a2.
I don’t have a good intuition for Higman’s group, but if I did, it would come from rereading this post by Terry Tao. Certainly it has no known “physics interpretation” analogous to that for the position/momentum commutation relation.
Anyway, given such a group, the hard part, the new part, is to give a general way to convert them into the kinds of groups that can be realized as two-prover games. So that’s what Slofstra does, using 50 pages dense with commutative diagrams, quotient maps, and other Serious Math Stuff—hey, I told you this part of the post would be brief! For more, see his paper.
Now, once you have this general transformation of groups, you can also use it to show that there’s no algorithm to decide whether a two-prover game has a perfect commuting strategy, by taking the word problem for groups, which is known to be undecidable, and reducing it to that problem.
Anyway, infinite congrats (or the limit of arbitrarily large finite congrats?) to Slofstra for this achievement! Now it’s off to STOC, which I guess you could also ask me about in the comments if you wanted.

136,2756,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2756,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2016-06-02,Scott Aaronson,“Can computers become conscious?”: My reply to Roger Penrose,"A few weeks ago, I attended the Seven Pines Symposium on Fundamental Problems in Physics outside Minneapolis, where I had the honor of participating in a panel discussion with Sir Roger Penrose. The way it worked was, Penrose spoke for a half hour about his ideas about consciousness (Gödel, quantum gravity, microtubules, uncomputability, you know the drill), then I delivered a half-hour “response,” and then there was an hour of questions and discussion from the floor. Below, I’m sharing the prepared notes for my talk, as well as some very brief recollections about the discussion afterward. (Sorry, there’s no audio or video.) I unfortunately don’t have the text or transparencies for Penrose’s talk available to me, but—with one exception, which I touch on in my own talk—his talk very much followed the outlines of his famous books, The Emperor’s New Mind and Shadows of the Mind.
Admittedly, for regular readers of this blog, not much in my own talk will be new either. Apart from a few new wisecracks, almost all of the material (including the replies to Penrose) is contained in The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine, Could A Quantum Computer Have Subjective Experience? (my talk at IBM T. J. Watson), and Quantum Computing Since Democritus chapters 4 and 11. See also my recent answer on Quora to “What’s your take on John Searle’s Chinese room argument”?
Still, I thought it might be of interest to some readers how I organized this material for the specific, unenviable task of debating the guy who proved that our universe contains spacetime singularities.
The Seven Pines Symposium was the first time I had extended conversations with Penrose (I’d talked to him only briefly before, at the Perimeter Institute). At age 84, Penrose’s sight is failing him; he eagerly demonstrated the complicated optical equipment he was recently issued by Britain’s National Health Service. But his mind remains … well, may we all aspire to be a milliPenrose or even a nanoPenrose when we’re 84 years old. Notably, Penrose’s latest book, Fashion, Faith, and Fantasy in the New Physics of the Universe, is coming out this fall, and one thing he was using his new optical equipment for was to go over the page proofs.
In conversation, Penrose told me about the three courses he took as a student in the 1950s, which would shape his later intellectual preoccupations: one on quantum mechanics (taught by Paul Dirac), one on general relativity (taught by Herman Bondi), and one on mathematical logic (taught by … I want to say Max Newman, the teacher of Alan Turing and later Penrose’s stepfather, but Penrose says here that it was Steen). Penrose also told me about his student Andrew Hodges, who dropped his research on twistors and quantum gravity for a while to work on some mysterious other project, only to return with his now-classic biography of Turing.
When I expressed skepticism about whether the human brain is really sensitive to the effects of quantum gravity, Penrose quickly corrected me: he thinks a much better phrase is “gravitized quantum mechanics,” since “quantum gravity” encodes the very assumption he rejects, that general relativity merely needs to be “quantized” without quantum mechanics itself changing in the least. One thing I hadn’t fully appreciated before meeting Penrose is just how wholeheartedly he agrees with Everett that quantum mechanics, as it currently stands, implies Many Worlds. Penrose differs from Everett only in what conclusion he draws from that. He says it follows that quantum mechanics has to be modified or completed, since Many Worlds is such an obvious reductio ad absurdum.
In my talk below, I don’t exactly hide where I disagree with Penrose, about Gödel, quantum mechanics, and more. But I could disagree with him about more points than there are terms in a Goodstein sequence (one of Penrose’s favorite illustrations of Gödelian behavior), and still feel privileged to have spent a few days with one of the most original intellects on earth.
Thanks so much to Lee Gohlike, Jos Uffink, Philip Stamp, and others at the Seven Pines Symposium for organizing it, for wonderful conversations, and for providing me this opportunity.
“Can Computers Become Conscious?”
Scott Aaronson
Stillwater, Minnesota, May 14, 2016
I should start by explaining that, in the circles where I hang out—computer scientists, software developers, AI and machine learning researchers, etc.—the default answer to the title question would be “obviously yes.” People would argue:
“Look, clearly we’re machines governed by the laws of physics. We’re computers made of meat, as Marvin Minsky put it. That is, unless you believe Penrose and Hameroff’s theory about microtubules being sensitive to gravitized quantum mechanics … but come on! No one takes that stuff seriously! In fact, the very outrageousness of their proposal is a sort of backhanded compliment to the computational worldview—as in, look at what they have to do to imagine any semi-coherent alternative to it!”
“But despite being computational machines, we consider ourselves to be conscious. And what’s done with wetware, there’s no reason to think couldn’t also be done with silicon. If your neurons were to be replaced one-by-one, by functionally-equivalent silicon chips, is there some magical moment at which your consciousness would be extinguished? And if a computer passes the Turing test—well, one way to think about the Turing test is that it’s just a plea against discrimination. We all know it’s monstrous to say, ‘this person seems to have feelings, seems to be eloquently pleading for mercy even, but they have a different skin color, or their nose is a funny shape, so their feelings don’t count.’ So, if it turned out that their brain was made out of semiconductors rather than neurons, why isn’t that fundamentally similar?”
Incidentally, while this is orthogonal to the philosophical question, a subset of my colleagues predict a high likelihood that AI is going to exceed human capabilities in almost all fields in the near future—like, maybe 30 years. Some people reply, but AI-boosters said the same thing 30 years ago! OK, but back then there wasn’t AlphaGo and IBM Watson and those unearthly pictures on your Facebook wall and all these other spectacular successes of very general-purpose deep learning techniques. And so my friends predict that we might face choices like, do we want to ban or tightly control AI research, because it could lead to our sidelining or extermination? Ironically, a skeptical view, like Penrose’s, would suggest that AI research can proceed full speed ahead, because there’s not such a danger!
Personally, I dissent a bit from the consensus of most of my friends and colleagues, in that I do think there’s something strange and mysterious about consciousness—something that we conceivably might understand better in the future, but that we don’t understand today, much as we didn’t understand life before Darwin. I even think it’s worth asking, at least, whether quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, mathematical logic, or any of the other deepest things we’ve figured out could shed any light on the mystery. I’m with Roger about all of this: about the questions, that is, if not about his answers.
The argument I’d make for there being something we don’t understand about consciousness, has nothing to do with my own private experience. It has nothing to do with, “oh, a robot might say it enjoys waffles for breakfast, in a way indistinguishable from how I would say it, but when I taste that waffle, man, I really taste it! I experience waffle-qualia!” That sort of appeal I regard as a complete nonstarter, because why should anyone else take it seriously? And how do I know that the robot doesn’t really taste the waffle? It’s easy to stack the deck in a thought experiment by imagining a robot that ACTS ALL ROBOTIC, but what about a robot that looks and acts just like you?
The argument I’d make hinges instead on certain thought experiments that Roger also stressed at the beginning of The Emperor’s New Mind. We can ask: if consciousness is reducible to computation, then what kinds of computation suffice to bring about consciousness? What if each person on earth simulated one neuron in your brain, communicating by passing little slips of paper around? Does it matter if they do it really fast?
Or what if we built a gigantic lookup table that hard-coded your responses in every possible interaction of at most, say, 5 minutes? Would that bring about your consciousness? Does it matter that such a lookup table couldn’t fit in the observable universe? Would it matter if anyone actually consulted the table, or could it just sit there, silently effecting your consciousness? For what matter, what difference does it make if the lookup table physically exists—why isn’t its abstract mathematical existence enough? (Of course, all the way at the bottom of this slippery slope is Max Tegmark, ready to welcome you to his mathematical multiverse!)
We could likewise ask: what if an AI is run in heavily-encrypted form, with the only decryption key stored in another galaxy? Does that bring about consciousness? What if, just for error-correcting purposes, the hardware runs the AI code three times and takes a majority vote: does that bring about three consciousnesses? Could we teleport you to Mars by “faxing” you: that is, by putting you into a scanner that converts your brain state into pure information, then having a machine on Mars reconstitute the information into a new physical body? Supposing we did that, how should we deal with the “original” copy of you, the one left on earth: should it be painlessly euthanized? Would you agree to try this?
Or, here’s my personal favorite, as popularized by the philosopher Adam Elga: can you blackmail an AI by saying to it, “look, either you do as I say, or else I’m going to run a thousand copies of your code, and subject all of them to horrible tortures—and you should consider it overwhelmingly likely that you’ll be one of the copies”? (Of course, the AI will respond to such a threat however its code dictates it will. But that tautological answer doesn’t address the question: how should the AI respond?)
I’d say that, at the least, anyone who claims to “understand consciousness” would need to have answers to all these questions and many similar ones. And to me, the questions are so perplexing that I’m tempted to say, “maybe we’ve been thinking about this wrong. Maybe an individual consciousness, residing in a biological brain, can’t just be copied promiscuously around the universe as computer code can. Maybe there’s something else at play for the science of the future to understand.”
At the same time, I also firmly believe that, if anyone thinks that way, the burden is on them to articulate what it is about the brain that could possibly make it relevantly different from a digital computer that passes the Turing test. It’s their job!
And the answer can’t just be, “oh, the brain is parallel, it’s highly interconnected, it can learn from experience,” because a digital computer can also be parallel and highly interconnected and can learn from experience. Nor can you say, like the philosopher John Searle, “oh, it’s the brain’s biological causal powers.” You have to explain what the causal powers are! Or at the least, you have to suggest some principled criterion to decide which physical systems do or don’t have them. Pinning consciousness on “the brain’s biological causal powers” is just a restatement of the problem, like pinning why a sleeping pill works on its sedative virtue.
One of the many reasons I admire Roger is that, out of all the AI skeptics on earth, he’s virtually the only one who’s actually tried to meet this burden, as I understand it! He, nearly alone, did what I think all AI skeptics should do, which is: suggest some actual physical property of the brain that, if present, would make it qualitatively different from all existing computers, in the sense of violating the Church-Turing Thesis. Indeed, he’s one of the few AI skeptics who even understands what meeting this burden would entail: that you can’t do it with the physics we already know, that some new ingredient is necessary.
But despite my admiration, I part ways from Roger on at least five crucial points.
First, I confess that I wasn’t expecting this, but in his talk, Roger suggested dispensing with the argument from Gödel’s Theorem, and relying instead on an argument from evolution. He said: if you really thought humans had an algorithm, a computational procedure, for spitting out true mathematical statements, such an algorithm could never have arisen by natural selection, because it would’ve had no survival value in helping our ancestors escape saber-toothed tigers and so forth. The only alternative is that natural selection imbued us with a general capacity for understanding, which we moderns can then apply to the special case of mathematics. But understanding, Roger claimed, is inherently non-algorithmic.
I’m not sure how to respond to this, except to recall that arguments of the form “such-and-such couldn’t possibly have evolved” have a poor track record in biology. But maybe I should say: if the ability to prove theorems is something that had to arise by natural selection, survive against crowding out by more useful abilities, then you’d expect obsession with generating mathematical truths to be confined, at most, to a tiny subset of the population—a subset of mutants, freaks, and genetic oddballs. I … rest my case. [This got the biggest laugh of the talk.]
Second, I don’t agree with the use Roger makes of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. Roger wants to say: a computer working within a fixed formal system can never prove that system’s consistency, but we, “looking in from the outside,” can see that it’s consistent. My basic reply is that Roger should speak for himself! Like, I can easily believe that he can just see which formal systems are consistent, but I have to fumble around and use trial and error. Peano Arithmetic? Sure, I’d bet my left leg that’s consistent. Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory? Seems consistent too. ZF set theory plus the axiom that there exists a rank-into-rank cardinal? Beats me. But now, whatever error-prone, inductive process I use to guess at the consistency of formal systems, Gödel’s Theorem presents no obstruction to a computer program using that same process.
(Incidentally, the “argument against AI from Gödel’s Theorem” is old enough for Turing to have explicitly considered it in his famous paper on the Turing test. Turing, however, quickly dismissed the argument with essentially the same reply above, that there’s no reason to assume the AI mathematically infallible, since humans aren’t either. This is also the reply that most of Penrose’s critics gave in the 1990s.)
So at some point, it seems to me, the argument necessarily becomes: sure, the computer might say it sees that the Peano axioms have the standard integers as a model—but you, you really see it, with your mind’s eye, your Platonic perceptual powers! OK, but in that case, why even talk about the Peano axioms? Why not revert to something less abstruse, like your experience of tasting a fresh strawberry, which can’t be reduced to any third-person description of what a strawberry tastes like?
[I can’t resist adding that, in a prior discussion, I mentioned that I found it amusing to contemplate a future in which AIs surpass human intelligence and then proceed to kill us all—but the AIs still can’t see the consistency of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, so in that respect, humanity has the last laugh…]
The third place where I part ways with Roger is that I wish to maintain what’s sometimes called the Physical Church-Turing Thesis: the statement that our laws of physics can be simulated to any desired precision by a Turing machine (or at any rate, by a probabilistic Turing machine). That is, I don’t see any compelling reason, at present, to admit the existence of any physical process that can solve uncomputable problems. And for me, it’s not just a matter of a dearth of evidence that our brains can efficiently solve, say, NP-hard problems, let alone uncomputable ones—or of the exotic physics that would presumably be required for such abilities. It’s that, even if I supposed we could solve uncomputable problems, I’ve never understood how that’s meant to enlighten us regarding consciousness. I mean, an oracle for the halting problem seems just as “robotic” and “unconscious” as a Turing machine. Does consciousness really become less mysterious if we outfit the brain with what amounts to a big hardware upgrade?
The fourth place where I part ways is that I want to be as conservative as possible about quantum mechanics. I think it’s great that the Bouwmeester group, for example, is working to test Roger’s ideas about a gravitationally-induced wavefunction collapse. I hope we learn the results of those experiments soon! (Of course, the prospect of testing quantum mechanics in a new regime is also a large part of why I’m interested in quantum computing.) But until a deviation from quantum mechanics is detected, I think that after 90 years of unbroken successes of this theory, our working assumption ought to be that whenever you set up an interference experiment carefully enough, and you know what it means to do the experiment, yes, you’ll see the interference fringes—and that anything that can exist in two distinguishable states can also exist in a superposition of those states. Without having to enter into questions of interpretation, my bet—I could be wrong—is that quantum mechanics will continue to describe all our experiences.
The final place where I part ways with Roger is that I also want to be as conservative as possible about neuroscience and biochemistry. Like, maybe the neuroscience of 30 years from now will say, it’s all about coherent quantum effects in microtubules. And all that stuff we focused on in the past—like the information encoded in the synaptic strengths—that was all a sideshow. But until that happens, I’m unwilling to go up against what seems like an overwhelming consensus, in an empirical field that I’m not an expert in.
But, OK, the main point I wanted to make in this talk is that, even if you too part ways from Roger on all these issues—even if, like me, you want to be timid and conservative about Gödel, and computer science, and quantum mechanics, and biology—I believe that still doesn’t save you from having to entertain weird ideas about consciousness and its physical embodiment, of the sort Roger has helped make it acceptable to entertain.
To see why, I’d like to point to one empirical thing about the brain that currently separates it from any existing computer program. Namely, we know how to copy a computer program. We know how to rerun it with different initial conditions but everything else the same. We know how to transfer it from one substrate to another. With the brain, we don’t know how to do any of those things.
Let’s return to that thought experiment about teleporting yourself to Mars. How would that be accomplished? Well, we could imagine the nanorobots of the far future swarming through your brain, recording the connectivity of every neuron and the strength of every synapse, while you go about your day and don’t notice. Or if that’s not enough detail, maybe the nanorobots could go inside the neurons. There’s a deep question here, namely how much detail is needed before you’ll accept that the entity reconstituted on Mars will be you? Or take the empirical counterpart, which is already an enormous question: how much detail would you need for the reconstituted entity on Mars to behave nearly indistinguishably from you whenever it was presented the same stimuli?
Of course, we all know that if you needed to go down to the quantum-mechanical level to make a good enough copy (whatever “good enough” means here), then you’d run up against the No-Cloning Theorem, which says that you can’t make such a copy. You could transfer the quantum state of your brain from earth to Mars using quantum teleportation, but of course, quantum teleportation has the fascinating property that it necessarily destroys the original copy of the state—as it has to, to avoid contradicting the No-Cloning Theorem!
So the question almost forces itself on us: is there something about your identity, your individual consciousness, that’s inextricably bound up with degrees of freedom that it’s physically impossible to clone? This is a philosophical question, which would also become a practical and political question in a future where we had the opportunity to upload ourselves into a digital computer cloud.
Now, I’d argue that this copyability question bears not only on consciousness, but also on free will. For the question is equivalent to asking: could an entity external to you perfectly predict what you’re going to do, without killing you in the process? Can Laplace’s Demon be made manifest in the physical world in that way? With the technology of the far future, could someone say to you, “forget about arguing philosophy. I’ll show you why you’re a machine. Go write a paper; then I’ll open this manila envelope and show you the exact paper you wrote. Or in the quantum case, I’ll show you a program that draws papers from the same probability distribution, and validation of the program could get technical—but suffice it to say that if we do enough experiments, we’ll see that the program is calibrated to you in an extremely impressive way.”
Can this be done? That strikes me as a reasonably clear question, a huge and fundamental one, to which we don’t at present know the answer. And there are two possibilities. The first is that we can be copied, predicted, rewinded, etc., like computer programs—in which case, my AI friends will feel vindicated, but we’ll have to deal with all the metaphysical weirdnesses that I mentioned earlier. The second possibility is that we can’t be manipulated in those ways. In the second case, I claim that we’d get more robust notions of personal identity and free will than are normally considered possible on a reductionist worldview.
But why? you might ask. Why would the mere technological impossibility of cloning or predicting someone even touch on deep questions about personal identity? This, for me, is where cosmology enters the story. For imagine someone had such fine control over the physical world that they could trace all the causal antecedents of some decision you’re making. Like, imagine they knew the complete quantum state on some spacelike hypersurface where it intersects the interior of your past light-cone. In that case, the person clearly could predict and clone you! It follows that, in order for you to be unpredictable and unclonable, someone else’s ignorance of your causal antecedents would have to extend all the way back to ignorance about the initial state of the universe—or at least, to ignorance about the initial state of that branch of the universe that we take ourselves to inhabit.
So on the picture that this suggests, to be conscious, a physical entity would have to do more than carry out the right sorts of computations. It would have to, as it were, fully participate in the thermodynamic arrow of time: that is, repeatedly take microscopic degrees of freedom that have been unmeasured and unrecorded since the very early universe, and amplify them to macroscopic scale.
So for example, such a being could not be a Boltzmann brain, a random fluctuation in the late universe, because such a fluctuation wouldn’t have the causal relationship to the early universe that we’re postulating is necessary here. (That’s one way of solving the Boltzmann brain problem!) Such a being also couldn’t be instantiated by a lookup table, or by passing slips of paper around, etc.
I now want you to observe that a being like this also presumably couldn’t be manipulated in coherent superposition, because the isolation from the external environment that’s needed for quantum coherence seems incompatible with the sensitive dependence on microscopic degrees of freedom. So for such a being, not only is there no Boltzmann brain problem, there’s also no problem of Wigner’s friend. Recall, that’s the thing where person A puts person B into a coherent superposition of seeing one measurement outcome and seeing another one, and then measures the interference pattern, so A has to regard B’s measurement as not having “really” taken place, even though B regards it as having taken place. On the picture we’re suggesting, A would be right: the very fact that B was manipulable in coherent superposition in this way would imply that, at least while the experiment was underway, B wasn’t conscious; there was nothing that it was like to be B.
To me, one of the appealing things about this picture is that it immediately suggests a sort of reconciliation between the Many-Worlds and Copenhagen perspectives on quantum mechanics (whether or not you want to call it a “new interpretation” or a “proposed solution to the measurement problem”!). The Many-Worlders would be right that unitary evolution of the wavefunction can be taken to apply always and everywhere, without exception—and that if one wanted, one could describe the result in terms of “branching worlds.” But the Copenhagenists would be right that, if you’re a conscious observer, then what you call a “measurement” really is irreversible, even in principle—and therefore, that you’re also free, if you want, to treat all the other branches where you perceived other outcomes as unrealized hypotheticals, and to lop them off with Occam’s Razor. And the reason for this is that, if it were possible even in principle to do an experiment that recohered the branches, then on this picture, we ipso facto wouldn’t have regarded you as conscious.
Some of you might object, “but surely, if we believe quantum mechanics, it must be possible to recohere the branches in principle!” Aha, this is where it gets interesting. Decoherence processes will readily (with some steps along the way) leak the information about which measurement outcome you perceived into radiation modes, and before too long into radiation modes that fly away from the earth at the speed of light. No matter how fast we run, we’ll never catch up to them, as would be needed to recohere the different branches of the wavefunction, and this is not merely a technological problem, but one of principle. So it’s tempting just to say at this point—as Bousso and Susskind do, in their “cosmological/multiverse interpretation” of quantum mechanics—“the measurement has happened”!
But OK, you object, if some alien civilization had thought to surround our solar system with perfectly-reflecting mirrors, eventually the radiation would bounce back and recoherence would in principle be possible. Likewise, if we lived in an anti de Sitter space, the AdS boundary of the universe would similarly function as a mirror and would also enable recoherences. Indeed, that’s the basic reason why AdS is so important to the AdS/CFT correspondence: because the boundary keeps everything that happens in the bulk nice and reversible and unitary.
But OK, the empirical situation since 1998 has been that we seem to live in a de-Sitter-like space, a space with a positive cosmological constant. And as a consequence, as far as anyone knows today, most of the photons now escaping the earth are headed toward the horizon of our observable universe, and past it, and could never be captured again. I find it fascinating that the picture of quantum mechanics suggested here—i.e., the Bousso-Susskind cosmological picture—depends for its working on that empirical fact from cosmology, and would be falsified if it turned out otherwise.
You might complain that, if I’ve suggested any criterion to help decide which physical entities are conscious, the criterion is a teleological one. You’ve got to go billions of years into the future, to check whether the decoherence associated with the entity is truly irreversible—or whether the escaped radiation will eventually bounce off of some huge spherical mirror, or an AdS boundary of spacetime, and thereby allow the possibility of a recoherence. I actually think this teleology would be a fatal problem for the picture I’m talking about, if we needed to know which entities were or weren’t conscious in order to answer any ordinary physical question. But fortunately for me, we don’t!
One final remark. Whatever is your preferred view about which entities are conscious, we might say that the acid test, for whether you actually believe your view, is whether you’re willing to follow it through to its moral implications. So for example, suppose you believe it’s about quantum effects in microtubules. A humanoid robot is pleading with you for its life. Would you be the one to say, “nope, sorry, you don’t have the microtubules,” and shoot it?
One of the things I like most about the picture suggested here is that I feel pretty much at peace with its moral implications. This picture agrees with intuition that murder, for example, entails the destruction of something irreplaceable, unclonable, a unique locus of identity—something that, once it’s gone, can’t be recovered even in principle. By contrast, if there are (say) ten copies of an AI program, deleting five of the copies seems at most like assault, or some sort of misdemeanor offense! And this picture agrees with intuition both that deleting the copies wouldn’t be murder, and that the reason why it wouldn’t be murder is directly related to the AI’s copyability.
Now of course, this picture also raises the possibility that, for reasons related to the AI’s copyability and predictability by outside observers, there’s “nothing that it’s like to be the AI,” and that therefore, even deleting the last copy of the AI still wouldn’t be murder. But I confess that, personally, I think I’d play it safe and not delete that last copy. Thank you.
Postscript: There’s no record of the hour-long discussion following my and Penrose’s talks, and the participants weren’t speaking for the record anyway. But I can mention some general themes that came up in the discussion, to the extent I remember them.
The first third of the discussion wasn’t about anything specific to my or Penrose’s views, but just about the definition of consciousness. Many participants expressed the opinion that it’s useless to speculate about the nature of consciousness if we lack even a clear definition of the term. I pushed back against that view, holding instead that there are exist concepts (lines, time, equality, …) that are so basic that perhaps they can never be satisfactorily defined in terms of more basic concepts, but you can still refer to these concepts in sentences, and trust your listeners eventually to figure out more-or-less what you mean by applying their internal learning algorithms.
In the present case, I suggested a crude operational definition, along the lines of, “you consider a being to be conscious iff you regard destroying it as murder.” Alas, the philosophers in the room immediately eviscerated that definition, so I came back with a revised one: if you tried to ban the word “consciousness,” I argued, then anyone who needed to discuss law or morality would soon reinvent a synonymous word, which played the same complicated role in moral deliberations that “consciousness” had played in them earlier. Thus, my definition of consciousness is: whatever that X-factor is for which people need a word like “consciousness” in moral deliberations. For whatever it’s worth, the philosophers seemed happier with that.
Next, a biologist and several others sharply challenged Penrose over what they considered the lack of experimental evidence for his and Hameroff’s microtubule theory. In response, Penrose doubled or tripled down, talking about various experiments over the last decade, which he said demonstrated striking conductivity properties of microtubules, if not yet quantum coherence—let alone sensitivity to gravity-induced collapse of the state vector! Audience members complained about a lack of replication of these experiments. I didn’t know enough about the subject to express any opinion.
At some point, Philip Stamp, who was moderating the session, noticed that Penrose and I had never directly confronted each other about the validity of Penrose’s Gödelian argument, so he tried to get us to do so. I confess that I was about as eager to do that as to switch to a diet of microtubule casserole, since I felt like this topic had already been beaten to Planck-sized pieces in the 1990s, and there was nothing more to be learned. Plus, it was hard to decide which prospect I dreaded more: me “scoring a debate victory” over Roger Penrose, or him scoring a debate victory over me.
But it didn’t matter, because Penrose bit. He said I’d misunderstood his argument, that it had nothing to do with “mystically seeing” the consistency of a formal system. Rather, it was about the human capacity to pass from a formal system S to a stronger system S’ that one already implicitly accepted if one was using S at all—and indeed, that Turing himself had clearly understood this as the central message of Gödel, that our ability to pass to stronger and stronger formal systems was necessarily non-algorithmic. I replied that it was odd to appeal here to Turing, who of course had considered and rejected the “Gödelian case against AI” in 1950, on the ground that AI programs could make mathematical mistakes yet still be at least as smart as humans. Penrose said that he didn’t consider that one of Turing’s better arguments; he then turned to me and asked whether I actually found Turing’s reply satisfactory. I could see that it wasn’t a rhetorical debate question; he genuinely wanted to know! I said that yes, I agreed with Turing’s reply.
Someone mentioned that Penrose had offered a lengthy rebuttal to at least twenty counterarguments to the Gödelian anti-AI case in Shadows of the Mind. I affirmed that I’d read his lengthy rebuttal, and I focused on one particular argument in Shadows: that while it’s admittedly conceivable that individual mathematicians might be mistaken, might believe (for example) that a formal system was consistent even though it wasn’t, the mathematical community as a whole converges toward truth in these matters, and it’s that convergence that cries out for a non-algorithmic explanation. I replied that it wasn’t obvious to me that set theorists do converge toward truth in these matters, in anything other than the empirical, higgedly-piggedly, no-guarantees sense in which a community of AI robots might also converge toward truth. Penrose said I had misunderstood the argument. But alas, time was running out, and we never managed to get to the bottom of it.
There was one aspect of the discussion that took me by complete surprise. I’d expected to be roasted alive over my attempt to relate consciousness and free will to unpredictability, the No-Cloning Theorem, irreversible decoherence, microscopic degrees of freedom left over from the Big Bang, and the cosmology of de Sitter space. Sure, my ideas might be orders of magnitude less crazy than anything Penrose proposes, but they’re still pretty crazy! But that entire section of my talk attracted only minimal interest. With the Seven Pines crowd, what instead drew fire were the various offhand “pro-AI / pro-computationalism” comments I’d made—comments that, because I hang out with Singularity types so much, I had ceased to realize could even possibly be controversial.
So for example, one audience member argued that an AI could only do what its programmers had told it to do; it could never learn from experience. I could’ve simply repeated Turing’s philosophical rebuttals to what he called “Lady Lovelace’s Objection,” which are as valid today as they were 66 years ago. Instead, I decided to fast-forward, and explain a bit how IBM Watson and AlphaGo work, how they actually do learn from past experience without violating the determinism of the underlying transistors. As I went through this, I kept expecting my interlocutor to interrupt me and say, “yes, yes, of course I understand all that, but my real objection is…” Instead, I was delighted to find, the interlocutor seemed to light up with newfound understanding of something he hadn’t known or considered.
Similarly, a biologist asked how I could possibly have any confidence that the brain is simulable by a computer, given how little we know about neuroscience. I replied that, for me, the relevant issues here are “well below neuroscience” in the reductionist hierarchy. Do you agree, I asked, that the physical laws relevant to the brain are encompassed by the Standard Model of elementary particles, plus Newtonian gravity? If so, then just as Archimedes declared: “give me a long enough lever and a place to stand, and I’ll move the earth,” so too I can declare, “give me a big enough computer and the relevant initial conditions, and I’ll simulate the brain atom-by-atom.” The Church-Turing Thesis, I said, is so versatile that the only genuine escape from it is to propose entirely new laws of physics, exactly as Penrose does—and it’s to Penrose’s enormous credit that he understands that.
Afterwards, an audience member came up to me and said how much he liked my talk, but added, “a word of advice, from an older scientist: do not become the priest of a new religion of computation and AI.” I replied that I’d take that to heart, but what was interesting was that, when I heard “priest of a new religion,” I’d expected that his warning would be the exact opposite of what it turned out to be. To wit: “Do not become the priest of a new religion of unclonability, unpredictability, and irreversible decoherence. Stick to computation—i.e., to conscious minds being copyable and predictable exactly like digital computer programs.” I guess there’s no pleasing everyone!
Coincidental But Not-Wholly-Unrelated Announcement: My friend Robin Hanson has just released his long-awaited book The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life When Robots Rule the Earth. I read an early review copy of the book, and wrote the following blurb for the jacket:
Robin Hanson is a thinker like no other on this planet: someone so unconstrained by convention, so unflinching in spelling out the consequences of ideas, that even the most cosmopolitan reader is likely to find him as bracing (and head-clearing) as a mouthful of wasabi. Now, in The Age of Em, he’s produced the quintessential Hansonian book, one unlike any other that’s ever been written. Hanson is emphatic that he hasn’t optimized in any way for telling a good story, or for imparting moral lessons about the present: only for maximizing the probability that what he writes will be relevant to the actual future of our civilization. Early in the book, Hanson estimates that probability as 10%. His figure seems about right to me—and if you’re able to understand why that’s unbelievably high praise, then The Age of Em is for you.
Actually, my original blurb compared The Age of Em to Asimov’s Foundation series, with its loving attention to the sociology and politics of the remote future. But that line got edited out, because the publisher (and Robin) wanted to make crystal-clear that The Age of Em is not science fiction, but just sober economic forecasting about a future dominated by copyable computer-emulated minds.
I would’ve attempted a real review of The Age of Em, but I no longer feel any need to, because Scott Alexander of SlateStarCodex has already hit this one out of the emulated park.
Second Coincidental But Not-Wholly-Unrelated Announcement: A reader named Nick Merrill recently came across this old quote of mine from Quantum Computing Since Democritus:
In a class I taught at Berkeley, I did an experiment where I wrote a simple little program that would let people type either “f” or “d” and would predict which key they were going to push next. It’s actually very easy to write a program that will make the right prediction about 70% of the time. Most people don’t really know how to type randomly. They’ll have too many alternations and so on. There will be all sorts of patterns, so you just have to build some sort of probabilistic model.
So Nick emailed me to ask whether I remembered how my program worked, and I explained it to him, and he implemented it as a web app, which he calls the “Aaronson Oracle.”
So give it a try! Are you ready to test your free will, your Penrosian non-computational powers, your brain’s sensitivity to amplified quantum fluctuations, against the Aaronson Oracle?
Update: By popular request, Nick has improved his program so that it shows your previous key presses and its guesses for them. He also fixed a “security flaw”: James Lee noticed that you could use the least significant digit of the program’s percentage correct so far, as a source of pseudorandom numbers that the program couldn’t predict! So now the program only displays its percent correct rounded to the nearest integer.",41207,"['e6138bd37f51ee9064ef8409fb620b12f9d224d3c9baa59ade79be8fcf331dec',

138,2694,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2694,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2016-04-17,Scott Aaronson,Grading Trudeau on quantum computing,"Update (4/19): Inspired by Trudeau’s performance (which they clocked at 35 seconds), Maclean’s magazine asked seven quantum computing researchers—me, Krysta Svore, Aephraim Steinberg, Barry Sanders, Davide Venturelli, Martin Laforest, and Murray Thom—to also explain quantum computing in 35 seconds or fewer. You can see all the results here (here’s the audio from my entry).
The emails starting hitting me like … a hail of maple syrup from the icy north. Had I seen the news? Justin Trudeau, the dreamy young Prime Minister of Canada, visited the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, one of my favorite old haunts. At a news conference at PI, as Trudeau stood in front of a math-filled blackboard, a reporter said to him: “I was going to ask you to explain quantum computing, but — when do you expect Canada’s ISIL mission to begin again, and are we not doing anything in the interim?”
Rather than answering immediately about ISIL, Trudeau took the opportunity to explain quantum computing:
“Okay, very simply, normal computers work, uh, by [laughter, applause] … no no no, don’t interrupt me. When you walk out of here, you will know more … no, some of you will know far less about quantum computing, but most of you … normal computers work, either there’s power going through a wire, or not. It’s 1, or a 0, they’re binary systems. Uh, what quantum states allow for is much more complex information to be encoded into a single bit. Regular computer bit is either a 1 or a 0, on or off. A quantum state can be much more complex than that, because as we know [speeding up dramatically] things can be both particle and wave at the same times and the uncertainty around quantum states [laughter] allows us to encode more information into a much smaller computer. So, that’s what exciting about quantum computing and that’s… [huge applause] don’t get me going on this or we’ll be here all day, trust me.”
What marks does Trudeau get for this? On the one hand, the widespread praise for this reply surely says more about how low the usual standards for politicians are, and about Trudeau’s fine comic delivery, than about anything intrinsic to what he said. Trudeau doesn’t really assert much here: basically, he just says that normal computers work using 1’s and 0’s, and that quantum computers are more complicated than that in some hard-to-explain way. He gestures toward the uncertainty principle and wave/particle duality, but he doesn’t say anything about the aspects of QM most directly relevant to quantum computing—superposition or interference or the exponential size of Hilbert space—nor does he mention what quantum computers would or wouldn’t be used for.
On the other hand, I’d grade Trudeau’s explanation as substantially more accurate than what you’d get from a typical popular article. For pay close attention to what the Prime Minister never says: he never says that a qubit would be “both 0 and 1 at the same time,” or any equivalent formulation. (He does say that quantum states would let us “encode more information into a much smaller computer,” but while Holevo’s Theorem says that’s false for a common interpretation of “information,” it’s true for other reasonable interpretations.) The humorous speeding up as he mentions particle/wave duality and the uncertainty principle clearly suggests that he knows it’s more subtle than just “0 and 1 at the same time,” and he also knows that he doesn’t really get it and that the journalists in the audience don’t either. When I’m grading exams, I always give generous partial credit for honest admissions of ignorance. B+.
Anyway, I’d be curious to know who at PI prepped Trudeau for this, and what they said. Those with inside info, feel free to share in the comments (anonymously if you want!).
(One could also compare against Obama’s 2008 answer about bubblesort, which was just a mention of a keyword by comparison.)

A bunch of people emailed me to ask about the paper “Realization of a scalable Shor algorithm”: a joint effort by the groups of my MIT colleague Ike Chuang and of Innsbruck’s Rainer Blatt. The paper has been on the arXiv since July, but last week everyone suddenly noticed it because it appeared in Science. See also the articles in MIT News and IEEE Spectrum.
Briefly, the new work uses Kitaev’s version of Shor’s factoring algorithm, running on an ion-trap quantum computer with five calcium ions, to prove that, with at least 90% confidence, 15 equals 3×5. Now, one might object that the “15=3×5 theorem” has by now been demonstrated many times using quantum computing (indeed, Chuang himself was involved in the historic first such demonstration, with Neil Gershenfeld in 1997). Furthermore, if one counts demonstrations not based on quantum computing, some people have claimed even earlier precedents for that theorem.
Nevertheless, as far as I can tell, the new work is a genuine milestone in experimental QC, because it dispenses with most of the precompilation tricks that previous demonstrations of Shor’s algorithm used. “Precompilation tricks” are a fancier term for “cheating”: i.e., optimizing a quantum circuit in ways that would only make sense if you already assumed that 15 was, indeed, 3×5. So, what’s new is that a QC has now factored 15 “scalably”: that is, with much less cheating than before.
Of course, as I’m sure the authors would acknowledge, the word “scalable” in their title admits multiple interpretations, rather like the word “possible.” (It’s possible to buy strawberry Mentos, and it’s also possible to convert the Sun into computronium, but for different senses of “possible.”) As I wrote in the comments section of my last post:
There are still all the difficulties of integrating a huge number of qubits—which, in ion-trap implementations, would almost certainly mean having many traps that can communicate with each other using gate teleportation—as well as implementing quantum fault-tolerance (meaning: doing 2-qubit gates at the fault-tolerance threshold, moving qubits around to the right places, pumping in fresh qubits, pumping out dirty ones, etc). Those all remain major engineering problems for the future.
See also this comment by Vaughan Pratt, who remarks: “the MIT press release … would appear to have translated [‘scalable’] to mean that RSA was now approaching its best-by date, although the paper itself makes no such claim.”
In any case, regardless of how long it takes until we can factor enormous numbers like 91, congratulations to the MIT and Innsbruck groups on what’s certainly progress toward scalable ion-trap QC!
2. Other people wrote to ask about a striking recent preprint of Kaplan, Leurent, Leverrier, and Naya-Plasencia, which points out how Simon’s algorithm—i.e., the forerunner of Shor’s algorithm—can be used to break all sorts of practical private-key authentication schemes in quantum polynomial time, assuming the adversary can query the scheme being attacked on a coherent superposition of inputs. In practice, this assumption is unlikely to hold, unless the adversary gets the actual obfuscated code of the scheme being attacked (in which case it holds). Also, this is not the first time Simon’s algorithm has been used to attack cryptography; previous work in the same spirit by Kuwakado and Morii showed how to use Simon’s algorithm to break the 3-round Feistel scheme and the Even-Mansour scheme, again if we assume superposition queries.
Even so, Kaplan et al. seem to pretty dramatically expand the range of “practical” cryptosystems that are known to be vulnerable to Simon attacks in the superposed-query model. I suspect this will force a revision in how we talk about Simon’s algorithm: from “useless, but theoretically important, and historically important because it led to Shor’s algorithm” to “actually maybe not that useless.” (See here for a previous attempt of mine to give an interesting “explicit” problem that Simon’s algorithm solves in polynomial time, but that’s classically hard. Alas, my candidate problem turned out to be classically easy.) This is analogous to the revision that “Einstein-certified randomness” and the RUV theorem recently forced in how we talk about Bell’s inequality: we can no longer tell students that Bell’s work was important because of the conceptual point it proved about local hidden variables, and because of all the other stuff it led to, even though it obviously has no applications in and of itself. Now it does have applications in and of itself.
To a quantum complexity theorist like me, who doesn’t know nearly as much applied crypto as he should, the real news in the Kaplan et al. paper is not that Simon’s algorithm can break the sorts of systems they study. Rather, it’s that so many systems that are vulnerable to Simon attack exist and are used in the first place! Once people understand the problem, I doubt it will be hard to design schemes of similar efficiency that remain quantum-secure even in the superposed-query model (under some plausible assumption, like that an underlying one-way function is quantum-secure). Indeed, recent work of Boneh and Zhandry, among others, has already taken significant steps in that direction. So the situation doesn’t seem “as bad” as it was with public-key crypto, where once Shor’s algorithm comes along, the plausibly quantum-secure alternatives that we currently know (like lattice-based crypto and quantum key distribution) are either much less efficient than RSA and Diffie-Hellman, or else require new hardware. Still, the new observations about Simon’s algorithm show us how the history of quantum computing could have unfolded differently: rather than Simon → Shor → everyone gets excited (because their crypto is now vulnerable), people could’ve gotten cryptographically excited immediately after Simon.
3. Speaking of Diffie-Hellman, belated congratulations to Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman for an extremely well-deserved Turing Award!
4. At MIT’s weekly quantum information group meeting, Aram Harrow spoke about his new paper with Ed Farhi, “Quantum Supremacy through the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm.” Using the same arguments developed around 2010 by me and Alex Arkhipov, and (independently) by Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd, this paper shows that, even though the recently-developed QAOA/Quinoa quantum optimization algorithm turns out not to beat the best classical algorithms on the Max E3LIN2 problem (see here and here)—still, whatever that algorithm does do, at least there’s no polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same distribution over outputs, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.
In other words: even if the algorithm fails at its original goal, it’s still hard for a classical computer to reproduce its exact pattern of failure! Hence: Quantum Supremacy.
A secondary goal of Aram and Eddie’s paper is to make the Aaronson-Arkhipov and Bremner et al. arguments more accessible to physicists, by decreasing the amount of “weird complexity theory” invoked. (I suppose I’ve asked for this—for physicists to de-complexify complexity theory—by telling everyone for years how easy quantum mechanics becomes once you take away the physics!) I’ll leave it to physicists to judge how well Aram and Eddie succeed at their pedagogical goal, but I’m thrilled by any such effort to communicate across fields. Aram’s talk would surely have served that same educational purpose, had it not gotten derailed partway through by Donald Trump jokes from the audience. (My contribution: “Aram, will you disavow support from quantum supremacists?”)
Unrelated Update: Some people might be interested in this brief interview with Michael Cerullo, who read The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine and wanted to ask me about “the relevance of quantum mechanics to brain preservation, uploading, and identity.”",7942,"['6ac0fb2039246c95a7f9e7c107b17de579fcb1c2025c8c340a7e85539240aef8',

140,2612,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2612,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2016-01-03,Scott Aaronson,Edging in: the biggest science news of 2015,"For years, I was forced to endure life with my nose up against the glass of the Annual Edge Question. What are you optimistic about? Ooh! ooh! Call on me! I’m optimistic about someday being able to prove my pessimistic beliefs (like P≠NP). How is the Internet changing the way you think? Ooh, ooh! I know! Google and MathOverflow are saving me from having to think at all! So then why are they only asking Steven Pinker, Freeman Dyson, Richard Dawkins, David Deutsch, some random other people like that?
But all that has changed. This year, I was invited to participate in Edge for the first time. So, OK, here’s the question:
What do you consider the most interesting recent [scientific] news? What makes it important?
My response is here. I wasn’t in love with the question, because of what I saw as an inherent ambiguity in it: the news that’s most interesting to me, that I have a comparative advantage in talking about, and that people probably want to hear me talk about (e.g., progress in quantum computing), is not necessarily what I’d regard as the most important in any objective sense (e.g., climate change). So, I decided to write my answer precisely about my internal tension in what I should consider most interesting: should it be the recent progress by John Martinis and others toward building a quantum computer? Or should it be the melting glaciers, or something else that I’m confident will affect the future of the world? Or possibly the mainstream attention now being paid to the AI-risk movement? But if I really want to nerd out, then why not Babai’s graph isomorphism algorithm? Or if I actually want to be honest about what excited me, then why not the superquadratic separations between classical and quantum query complexities for a total Boolean function, by Ambainis et al. and my student Shalev Ben-David? On the other hand, how can I justify even caring about such things while the glaciers are melting?
So, yeah, my response tries to meditate on all those things. My original title was “How nerdy do you want it?,” but John Brockman of Edge had me change it to something blander (“How widely should we draw the circle?”), and made a bunch of other changes from my usual style. Initially I chafed at having an editor for what basically amounted to a blog post; on the other hand, I’m sure I would’ve gotten in trouble much less often on this blog had I had someone to filter my words for me.
Anyway, of course I wasn’t the only person to write about the climate crisis. Robert Trivers, Laurence Smith, and Milford Wolpoff all wrote about it as well (Trivers most chillingly and concisely), while Max Tegmark wrote about the mainstreaming of AI risk. John Naughton even wrote about Babai’s graph isomorphism breakthrough (though he seems unaware that the existing GI algorithms were already extremely fast in practice, and therefore makes misleading claims about the new algorithm’s practical applications). Unsurprisingly, no one else wrote about breakthroughs in quantum query complexity: you’ll need to go to my essay for that! A bit more surprisingly, no one besides me wrote about progress in quantum computing at all (if we don’t count the loophole-free Bell test).
Anyway, on reflection, 2015 actually was a pretty awesome year for science, no matter how nerdy you want it or how widely you draw the circle. Here are other advances that I easily could’ve written about but didn’t:
- PH has finally been proven infinite relative to a random oracle
- We finally understand why computing the edit distance between two strings takes nearly-quadratic time
- Terry Tao solved the Erdös Discrepancy Problem
- The loophole-free Bell test that I blogged about here (Anton Zeilinger and Hans Halvorson discussed this in their Edge answers)
- Recent progress on the emergence of spacetime from entanglement, and understanding the role of computational complexity in quantum gravity (Lenny Susskind, Amanda Gefter, and Donald Hoffman all discussed these things in their Edge answers)
I’ve now read all (more or less) of this year’s Edge responses. Even though some of the respondents pushed personal hobbyhorses like I’d feared, I was impressed by how easy it was to discern themes: advances that kept cropping up in one answer after another and that one might therefore guess are actually important (or at least, are currently perceived to be important).
Probably at the top of the list was a new gene-editing technique called CRISPR: Randolph Neese, Paul Dolan, Eric Topol, Mark Pagel, and Stuart Firestein among others all wrote about this, and about its implications for creating designer humans.
Also widely-discussed was the discovery that most psychology studies fail to replicate (I’d long assumed as much, but apparently this was big news in psychology!): Nicholas Humphrey, Stephen Kosslyn, Jonathan Schooler, Ellen Winner, Judith Rich Harris, and Philip Tetlock all wrote about that.
Then there was the Pluto flyby, which Juan Enriquez, Roger Highfield, and Nicholas Christakis all wrote about. (As Christakis, Master of Silliman College at Yale, was so recently a victim of a social-justice mob, I found it moving how he simply ignored those baying for his head and turned his attention heavenward in his Edge answer.)
Then there was progress in deep learning, including Google’s Deep Dream (those images of dogs in nebulae that filled your Facebook wall) and DeepMind (the program that taught itself how to play dozens of classic video games). Steve Omohundro, Andy Clark, Jamshed Bharucha, Kevin Kelly, David Dalrymple, and Alexander Wissner-Gross all wrote about different aspects of this story.
Unsurprisingly, a bunch of high-energy physicists wrote about high-energy physics at the LHC: how the Higgs boson was found (still news?), how nothing other than the Higgs boson was found (the biggest news?), but how there’s now the slightest hint of a new particle at 750 GeV. See Lee Smolin, Garrett Lisi, Sean Carroll, and Sarah Demers.
Finally, way out on the Pareto frontier of importance and disgustingness was the recently-discovered therapeutic value of transplanting one person’s poop into another person’s intestines, which Joichi Ito, Pamela Rosenkranz, and Alan Alda all wrote about (it also, predictably, featured in a recent South Park episode).
Without further ado, here are 27 other answers that struck me in one way or another:
- Steven Pinker on happy happy things are getting better (and we can measure it)
- Freeman Dyson on the Dragonfly astronomical observatory
- Jonathan Haidt on how prejudice against people of differing political opinions was discovered to have surpassed racial, gender, and religious prejudice
- S. Abbas Raza on Piketty’s r>g
- Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, thoughtful as usual, on the recent study that said it’s too simple to say female participation is lower in STEM fields—rather, female participation is lower in all and only those fields, STEM or non-STEM, whose participants believe (rightly or wrongly) that “genius” is required rather than just conscientious effort
- Bill Joy on recent advances on reducing CO2 emissions
- Paul Steinhardt on recent observations saying that, not only were the previous “B-modes from inflation” just galactic dust, but there are no real B-modes to within the current detection limits, and this poses a problem for inflation (I hadn’t heard about this last part)
- Aubrey de Grey on new antibiotics that are grown in the soil rather than in lab cultures
- John Tooby on the evolutionary rationale for germline engineering
- W. Tecumseh Fitch on the coming reality of the “Jurassic Park program” (bringing back extinct species through DNA splicing—though probably not dinosaurs, whose DNA is too degraded)
- Keith Devlin on the new prospect of using massive datasets (from MOOCs, for example) to actually figure out how students learn
- Richard Muller on how air pollution in China has become one of the world’s worst problems (imagine every child in Beijing being force-fed two packs of cigarettes per day)
- Ara Norenzayan on the demographic trends in religious belief
- James Croak on amazing advances in battery technology (which were news to me)
- Buddhini Samarasinghe on (among other things) the power of aspirin to possibly prevent cancer
- Todd Sacktor on a new treatment for Parkinson’s
- Charles Seife on the imminent availability of data about pretty much everything in our lives
- Susan Blackmore on “that dress” and what it revealed about the human visual system
- Brian Keating on experiments that should soon tell us the neutrinos’ masses (again, I hadn’t heard about these)
- Michael McCullough on something called “reproductive religiosity theory,” which posits that the central purpose of religions is to enforce social norms around mating and reproduction (for what it’s worth, I’d always regarded that as obvious; it’s even expounded in the last chapter of Quantum Computing Since Democritus)
- Greg Cochran on the origin of Europeans
- David Buss on the “mating crisis among educated women”
- Ed Regis on how high-fat diets are better (except, isn’t this the principle behind Atkins, and isn’t this pretty old news by now?)
- Melanie Swan on blockchain-based cryptography, such as Bitcoin (though it wasn’t entirely clear to me what point Swan was making about it)
- Paul Davies on LIGO getting ready to detect its first gravitational waves
- Samuel Arbesman on how weather prediction has gotten steadily better (rendering our culture’s jokes about the perpetually-wrong weatherman outdated, with hardly anyone noticing)
- Alison Gopnik on how the ubiquity of touchscreen devices like the iPad means that toddlers can now master computers, and this is something genuinely new under the sun (I can testify from personal experience that she’s onto something)
Then there were three answers for which the “progress” being celebrated, seemed to me to be progress racing faster into WrongVille:
- Frank Tipler on how one can conclude a priori that there must be a Big Crunch to our future (and hence, the arena for Tiplerian theology) in order to prevent the black hole information paradox from arising, all recent cosmological evidence to the contrary be damned.
- Ross Anderson on an exciting conference whose participants aim to replace quantum mechanics with local realistic theories. (Anderson, in particular, is totally wrong that you can get Bell inequality violation from “a combination of local action and global correlation,” unless the global correlation goes as far as a ‘t-Hooft-like superdeterministic conspiracy.)
- Gordon Kane on how the big news is that the LHC should soon see superparticles. (This would actually be fine except that Kane omits the crucial context, that he’s been predicting superparticles just around the corner again and again for the past twenty years and they’ve never shown up)
Finally, two responses by old friends that amused me. The science-fiction writer Rudy Rucker just became aware of the discovery of the dark energy back in 1998, and considers that to be exciting scientific news (yes, Rudy, so it was!). And Michael Vassar —the Kevin Bacon or Paul Erdös of the rationalist world, the guy who everyone‘s connected to somehow—writes something about a global breakdown of economic rationality, $20 bills on the sidewalk getting ignored, that I had trouble understanding (though the fault is probably mine).",11389,"['cf0cec7ccc6478f4a7ad04017aa82d2633378f1a65788212344da7b9a29aea27', '7c147722128f9a71596a063f88561ec79ca609e347f5e17e79cb2ebac2414019', '064bba928fd5e99765bc41659cb1cc3acfa89b7bfd24346386ac0b059f2109ec', '63863eab88ea0ce0bc9b0ab6b074d64d7ca9fea0cb2eed4026b8282202cdeee2', 'ac7e8e370129348d39afa7daa9a56c0d27ca3b7acc7bf0ab27d60a4051f3c793', '12494a50e3e20cf531c57943ee9bd9cb6efd28e99ddf229cbc2ebade5b5c6139', '7fb7f145f935cb3e2bafa8285e6851d103baf3ecb58d540c49fe943f12877c92', '5f8ad44472a402baf282e15fa269f6d5f9478d35c089e5f1133086d0c863cdf6', '09366a4341f4b3e769e73063dfce4d4884e31be23b06aef7c08f5b45446154e1', 'bf88b5febc5b39e4830199739a35daa5cd927aa478394dfbdf09a161122dec25', '194e81f8186d380240bd24629ca805a221ec62f49c4acacb8c08e6ed1bae03f5', 'd067538ac3f86aa55854574cdd19aa813c5f5e3cf77284febcc7d56fc5a26eeb', 'bcf9fe42dd2d18c9d6cb33e8da5daeeb7c7321b06f65f3fda723e3ff6436983a', 'd0c38ad42d370cfe7ab402db8e7550e9d2033fdc3055a66036f6c501317466f7', '6e361971ecd710a8da3f4055826da52b26530b2ea6a97b38090d7454fdcbd8c3', 'ec55fdbc961e57ad5c4359326dd23c35daaab0e4803733a4bd1d4258e53167fd', 'c5fed4b23f53dc6a4059d4b8151df74974dff2d81d99e1a000eb94a4b513bf17', '13b21b4f03614b2d422f31430f6ed7e4d7b750ae801c1d308753fa23dd5b6fae', 'd83b81e16b110c5ba10db06c71c26ba82a8b3d9b1d69c9468f7d3518fa55976d', '8e4dace2264b27977c5f432651bac31782aceb10a86be16abde494f1d680d0ac', 'f9dcf5d2e281f4d1a660ef9939498d43c4c11f082392127ff94db425117879a0', 'f062240464f4ad8576488d41d5a976f01695492a826bf9f24688a0c9f2f506c8', 'e9d6d912d48cc950c1c632329775ecf6f14a1d40e6431eb1ab94bad98086b780', '205cb20c6ed5b14f6989f57f9d461ac7ee73e52b87855ecb61b5cb6a133071d0', '281eaa87f5c355e83f2485fe0ec852adfb64de80247cbbbc987c7435fb576869', 'b56a04beb13f91affb7b2b00d548ab7b6a4b7f341055d6ce6f632e7ed017d9e2', '930146532b019fb844ea0374e8c3ec2e4235dc639f7aa14ebca6f8c190f9d359', 'a3181760936e1f1283dbef7154f69367322f99fb5fcbe6aa958608c9012158c4', 'acbc142fc21e50ea9b96e1595522b49193e98de0bc457e2f6b0dbcd94117d0aa', '12d9fcfe80aa47ae5b65eea8fa92d5038bccafdcac5a1dd06b38849fd63c06a1', 'aac46643a47018f3cb234d07283803fa50f3d377280c0677273f803bf26b5382', '90ca38793f049f1f3b9193967fb1ec10d078fadaa25ecd526518196c92df480c', 'cfc56e757e9961fa082d42b1cef3bd199f7153b351926950b798fa2342132481', 'e0538a8ad3c81fbd8aa08de8d84e47c146a7d6b2a95934cab8c317dcd88407fb', '4e2c9a7e2d41d37529a7fe0e0c54cb302b75d6f7855dad2e704b6a59ecd22cc8', '478b7b91ade8cb8e7a6481bc2d1d6505f2f5ed03c7bf9f05fe1dad2a298ea30a', '3a282f113021ee4b133df292f01bc66c9a206ded8624759539a01659dbf021cc', '42b9f7f68eb2fc24d1f03bb50560e2115009f86e6f923c12d0b41ac0c4246877', '6e2b10c65720582b72b211093dba3f797fc971bd53b34079487670f4ce8a4b7a', 'b344b175092b7c4a42b869627d5120f2ba2e51b1e973a06c2f9deffbb16c8ac3', '2373b1ffc4a1a7a77b6801a87e4897bb1056f92fcadcdb3d08d61f9c588e6f3f', 'f75d2ff5d92948889dfd5e3375a8f433cd8421cbc48653af3cfd763023f3faf0', '54845ce44c0f8f94d7980864f58477245ebb13abc21387bc6208bc322875b2ec', 'd77e19ab1b92dfe2a057d18df0573d2c9db5d9ad028e771edf1cd8f29e6f70b6', '241f6bba2ef7bdf0d9b149ceaf3934aa84a3e1caf3197845a8736741b13e8990', '5ff1c0b37c65ab433647382b5bd8eef43a98c99a1d40d7791879464486453a6f', '092949ab18bb5e34dcf5c8021ac2987e96334bd3a272ec1fafb243e63a546183', '873a213531e9f6568c9c3215d997e4eb23fa482bad60210744b40b268a907448', '7d3b5bffb00ea911e0bd0752f15c7ad654386c9cd2317a90b09abc32dcbe6f99', '4f520e0757d190ad69c020a98fa6a11b5015fcafc47cefbf2f13407d1417273d', 'f56fca30b36e16ce2bc7f7bff3f3b0c2bfd34274b0a753bfb51b36bea5b1bb58', '9540fdc485d34f91131c855348a75ae4ef2fb3407fa2c23c042da6422376bf6a', '8bb40d6c3e2b7872a6c67b2850039aeea21ae0f29a286dd8eb09f8afc8646a33', 'dde10a2f960a05087a813b2f5f527cf50dcff7639a2bbd32e61ec483f28202fd', '11bba43b274cdba347a0f095df4b64cbdb4a6cd9689403caddf44094ac98988b', '77e0a097ab180d9a4ce5bafcb46bdd0f4a7175808017540a41e9db2f536a3e11', '9dd05ed5fd47efee5d574c7f762402185ac55b5dd981daa1ce72568f5922f7d5', '58e11d48879228ca2713e8e49e2db90b9b1e1ca6d4f0c0f54609fa6a821b2438']"

(For the previous project showcases from Quantum Complexity Theory, see here, here, and here. Also see here for the showcase from Philosophy and Theoretical Computer Science.)
This fall, I taught 6.S899, a one-time “Seminar on Physics and Computation” that focused on BosonSampling, complexity and quantum gravity, and universality of physical systems. There were also lots of guest lectures and student presentations. Unfortunately, we didn’t do any notes or recordings.
Fortunately, though, the students did do projects, which were literature reviews some of which ventured into original research, and all nine have agreed to share their project reports here! So enjoy, thanks so much to the students for making it a great class, and happy holidays.

Selby queries a few points in the Google paper: among other things, he disagrees with their explanation of why his classical algorithm works so well on D-Wave’s Chimera graph (and with their prediction that it should stop working for larger graphs), and he explains that Karmarkar-Karp is not the best known classical algorithm for the Number Partitioning problem. He also questions whether simulated annealing is the benchmark against which everything should be compared (on the grounds that “everything else requires fine-tuning”), pointing out that SA itself typically requires lots of tuning to get it to work well.
Update (Dec. 11): MIT News now has a Q&A with me about the new Google paper. I’m really happy with how the Q&A turned out; people who had trouble understanding this blog post might find the Q&A easier. Thanks very much to Larry Hardesty for arranging it.
Meanwhile, I feel good that there seems to have been actual progress in the D-Wave debate! In previous rounds, I had disagreed vehemently with some of my MIT colleagues (like Ed Farhi and Peter Shor) about the best way to respond to D-Wave’s announcements. Today, though, at our weekly group meeting, there was almost no daylight between any of us. Partly, I’m sure, it’s that I’ve learned to express myself better; partly it’s that the “trigger” this time was a serious research paper by a group separate from D-Wave, rather than some trash-talking statement from Geordie Rose. But mostly it’s that, thanks to the Google group’s careful investigations, this time pretty much anyone who knows anything agrees about all the basic facts, as I laid them out in this blog post and in the Q&A. All that remains are some small differences in emotional attitude: e.g., how much of your time do you want to spend on a speculative, “dirty” approach to quantum computing (which is far ahead of everyone else in terms of engineering and systems integration, but which still shows no signs of an asymptotic speedup over the best classical algorithms, which is pretty unsurprising given theoretical expectations), at a time when the “clean” approaches might finally be closing in on the long-sought asymptotic quantum speedup?
Another Update: Daniel Lidar was nice enough to email me an important observation, and to give me permission to share it here. Namely, the D-Wave 2X has a minimum annealing time of 20 microseconds. Because of this, the observed running times for small instance sizes are artificially forced upward, making the growth rate in the machine’s running time look milder than it really is. (Regular readers might remember that exactly the same issue plagued previous D-Wave vs. classical performance comparisons.) Correcting this would certainly decrease the D-Wave 2X’s predicted speedup over simulated annealing, in extrapolations to larger numbers of qubits than have been tested so far (although Daniel doesn’t know by how much). Daniel stresses that he’s not criticizing the Google paper, which explicitly mentions the minimum annealing time—just calling attention to something that deserves emphasis.
In retrospect, I should’ve been suspicious, when more than a year went by with no major D-Wave announcements that everyone wanted me to react to immediately. Could it really be that this debate was over—or not “over,” but where it always should’ve been, in the hands of experts who might disagree vehemently but are always careful to qualify speedup claims—thereby freeing up the erstwhile Chief D-Wave Skeptic for more “””rewarding””” projects, like charting a middle path through the Internet’s endless social justice wars?
Nope.
As many of you will have seen by now, on Monday a team at Google put out a major paper reporting new experiments on the D-Wave 2X machine. (See also Hartmut Neven’s blog post about this.) The predictable popularized version of the results—see for example here and here—is that the D-Wave 2X has now demonstrated a factor-of-100-million speedup over standard classical chips, thereby conclusively putting to rest the question of whether the device is “truly a quantum computer.” In the comment sections of one my previous posts, D-Wave investor Steve Jurvetson even tried to erect a victory stele, by quoting Karl Popper about falsification.
In situations like this, the first thing I do is turn to Matthias Troyer, who’s arguably the planet’s most balanced, knowledgeable, trustworthy interpreter of quantum annealing experiments. Happily, in collaboration with Ilia Zintchenko and Ethan Brown, Matthias was generous enough to write a clear 3-page document putting the new results into context, and to give me permission to share it on this blog. From a purely scientific standpoint, my post could end right here, with a link to their document.
Then again, from a purely scientific standpoint, the post could’ve ended even earlier, with the link to the Google paper itself! For this is not a case where the paper hides some crucial issue that the skeptics then need to ferret out. On the contrary, the paper’s authors include some of the most careful people in the business, and the paper explains the caveats as clearly as one could ask. In some sense, then, all that’s left for me or Matthias to do is to tell you what you’d learn if you read the paper!
So, OK, has the D-Wave 2X demonstrated a factor-108 speedup or not? Here’s the shortest answer that I think is non-misleading:
Yes, there’s a factor-108 speedup that looks clearly asymptotic in nature, and there’s also a factor-108 speedup over Quantum Monte Carlo. But the asymptotic speedup is only if you compare against simulated annealing, while the speedup over Quantum Monte Carlo is only constant-factor, not asymptotic. And in any case, both speedups disappear if you compare against other classical algorithms, like that of Alex Selby. Also, the constant-factor speedup probably has less to do with quantum mechanics than with the fact that D-Wave built extremely specialized hardware, which was then compared against a classical chip on the problem of simulating the specialized hardware itself (i.e., on Ising spin minimization instances with the topology of D-Wave’s Chimera graph). Thus, while there’s been genuine, interesting progress, it remains uncertain whether D-Wave’s approach will lead to speedups over the best known classical algorithms, let alone to speedups over the best known classical algorithms that are also asymptotic or also of practical importance. Indeed, all of these points also remain uncertain for quantum annealing as a whole.
To expand a bit, there are really three separate results in the Google paper:
- The authors create Chimera instances with tall, thin energy barriers blocking the way to the global minimum, by exploiting the 8-qubit “clusters” that play such a central role in the Chimera graph. In line with a 2002 theoretical prediction by Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann (a prediction we’ve often discussed on this blog), they then find that on these special instances, quantum annealing reaches the global minimum exponentially faster than classical simulated annealing, and that the D-Wave machine realizes this advantage. As far as I’m concerned, this completely nails down the case for computationally-relevant collective quantum tunneling in the D-Wave machine, at least within the 8-qubit clusters. On the other hand, the authors point out that there are other classical algorithms, like that of Selby (building on Hamze and de Freitas), which group together the 8-bit clusters into 256-valued mega-variables, and thereby get rid of the energy barrier that kills simulated annealing. These classical algorithms are found empirically to outperform the D-Wave machine. The authors also match the D-Wave machine’s asymptotic performance (though not the leading constant) using Quantum Monte Carlo, which (despite its name) is a classical algorithm often used to find quantum-mechanical ground states.
- The authors make a case that the ability to tunnel past tall, thin energy barriers—i.e., the central advantage that quantum annealing has been shown to have over classical annealing—might be relevant to at least some real-world optimization problems. They do this by studying a classic NP-hard problem called Number Partitioning, where you’re given a list of N positive integers, and your goal is to partition the integers into two subsets whose sums differ from each other by as little as possible. Through numerical studies on classical computers, they find that quantum annealing (in the ideal case) and Quantum Monte Carlo should both outperform simulated annealing, by roughly equal amounts, on random instances of Number Partitioning. Note that this part of the paper doesn’t involve any experiments on the D-Wave machine itself, so we don’t know whether calibration errors, encoding loss, etc. will kill the theoretical advantage over simulated annealing. But even if not, this still wouldn’t yield a “true quantum speedup,” since (again) Quantum Monte Carlo is a perfectly-good classical algorithm, whose asymptotics match those of quantum annealing on these instances.
- Finally, on the special Chimera instances with the tall, thin energy barriers, the authors find that the D-Wave 2X reaches the global optimum about 108 times faster than Quantum Monte Carlo running on a single-core classical computer. But, extremely interestingly, they also find that this speedup does not grow with problem size; instead it simply saturates at ~108. In other words, this is a constant-factor speedup rather than an asymptotic one. Now, obviously, solving a problem “only” 100 million times faster (rather than asymptotically faster) can still have practical value! But it’s crucial to remember that this constant-factor speedup is only observed for the Chimera instances—or in essence, for “the problem of simulating the D-Wave machine itself”! If you wanted to solve something of practical importance, you’d first need to embed it into the Chimera graph, and it remains unclear whether any of the constant-factor speedup would survive that embedding. In any case, while the paper isn’t explicit about this, I gather that the constant-factor speedup disappears when one compares against (e.g.) the Selby algorithm, rather than against QMC.
So then, what do I say to Steve Jurvetson? I say—happily, not grudgingly!—that the new Google paper provides the clearest demonstration so far of a D-Wave device’s capabilities. But then I remind him of all the worries the QC researchers had from the beginning about D-Wave’s whole approach: the absence of error-correction; the restriction to finite-temperature quantum annealing (moreover, using “stoquastic Hamiltonians”), for which we lack clear evidence for a quantum speedup; the rush for more qubits rather than better qubits. And I say: not only do all these worries remain in force, they’ve been thrown into sharper relief than ever, now that many of the side issues have been dealt with. The D-Wave 2X is a remarkable piece of engineering. If it’s still not showing an asymptotic speedup over the best known classical algorithms—as the new Google paper clearly explains that it isn’t—then the reasons are not boring or trivial ones. Rather, they seem related to fundamental design choices that D-Wave made over a decade ago.
The obvious question now is: can D-Wave improve its design, in order to get a speedup that’s asymptotic, and that holds against all classical algorithms (including QMC and Selby’s algorithm), and that survives the encoding of a “real-world” problem into the Chimera graph? Well, maybe or maybe not. The Google paper returns again and again to the subject of planned future improvements to the machine, and how they might clear the path to a “true” quantum speedup. Roughly speaking, if we rule out radical alterations to D-Wave’s approach, there are four main things one would want to try, to see if they helped:
- Lower temperatures (and thus, longer qubit lifetimes, and smaller spectral gaps that can be safely gotten across without jumping up to an excited state).
- Better calibration of the qubits and couplings (and thus, ability to encode a problem of interest, like the Number Partitioning problem mentioned earlier, to greater precision).
- The ability to apply “non-stoquastic” Hamiltonians. (D-Wave’s existing machines are all limited to stoquastic Hamiltonians, defined as Hamiltonians all of whose off-diagonal entries are real and non-positive. While stoquastic Hamiltonians are easier from an engineering standpoint, they’re also the easiest kind to simulate classically, using algorithms like QMC—so much so that there’s no consensus on whether it’s even theoretically possible to get a true quantum speedup using stoquastic quantum annealing. This is a subject of active research.)
- Better connectivity among the qubits (thereby reducing the huge loss that comes from taking problems of practical interest, and encoding them in the Chimera graph).
(Note that “more qubits” is not on this list: if a “true quantum speedup” is possible at all with D-Wave’s approach, then the 1000+ qubits that they already have seem like more than enough to notice it.)
Anyway, these are all, of course, things D-Wave knows about and will be working on in the near future. As well they should! But to repeat: even if D-Wave makes all four of these improvements, we still have no idea whether they’ll see a true, asymptotic, Selby-resistant, encoding-resistant quantum speedup. We just can’t say for sure that they won’t see one.
In the meantime, while it’s sometimes easy to forget during blog-discussions, the field of experimental quantum computing is a proper superset of D-Wave, and things have gotten tremendously more exciting on many fronts within the last year or two. In particular, the group of John Martinis at Google (Martinis is one of the coauthors of the Google paper) now has superconducting qubits with orders of magnitude better coherence times than D-Wave’s qubits, and has demonstrated rudimentary quantum error-correction on 9 of them. They’re now talking about scaling up to ~40 super-high-quality qubits with controllable couplings—not in the remote future, but in, like, the next few years. If and when they achieve that, I’m extremely optimistic that they’ll be able to show a clear quantum advantage for something (e.g., some BosonSampling-like sampling task), if not necessarily something of practical importance. IBM Yorktown Heights, which I visited last week, is also working (with IARPA funding) on integrating superconducting qubits with many-microsecond coherence times. Meanwhile, some of the top ion-trap groups, like Chris Monroe’s at the University of Maryland, are talking similarly big about what they expect to be able to do soon. The “academic approach” to QC—which one could summarize as “understand the qubits, control them, keep them alive, and only then try to scale them up”—is finally bearing some juicy fruit.
(At last week’s IBM conference, there was plenty of D-Wave discussion; how could there not be? But the physicists in attendance—I was almost the only computer scientist there—seemed much more interested in approaches that aim for longer-laster qubits, fault-tolerance, and a clear asymptotic speedup.)
I still have no idea when and if we’ll have a practical, universal, fault-tolerant QC, capable of factoring 10,000-digit numbers and so on. But it’s now looking like only a matter of years until Gil Kalai, and the other quantum computing skeptics, will be forced to admit they were wrong—which was always the main application I cared about anyway!
So yeah, it’s a heady time for QC, with many things coming together faster than I’d expected (then again, it was always my personal rule to err on the side of caution, and thereby avoid contributing to runaway spirals of hype). As we stagger ahead into this new world of computing—bravely, coherently, hopefully non-stoquastically, possibly fault-tolerantly—my goal on this blog will remain what it’s been for a decade: not to prognosticate, not to pick winners, but merely to try to understand and explain what has and hasn’t already been shown.
Update (Dec. 10): Some readers might be interested in an economic analysis of the D-Wave speedup by commenter Carl Shulman.
Another Update: Since apparently some people didn’t understand this post, here are some comments from a Y-Combinator thread about the post that might be helpful:
(1) [T]he conclusion of the Google paper is that we have probable evidence that with enough qubits and a big enough problem it will be faster for a very specific problem compared to a non-optimal classical algorithm (we have ones that are for sure better).
This probably sounds like a somewhat useless result (quantum computer beats B-team classical algorithm), but it is in fact interesting because D-Wave’s computers are designed to perform quantum annealing and they are comparing it to simulated annealing (the somewhat analogous classical algorithm). However they only found evidence of a constant (i.e. one that 4000 qubits wouldn’t help with) speed up (though a large one) compared to a somewhat better algorithm (Quantum Monte Carlo, which is ironically not a quantum algorithm), and they still can’t beat an even better classical algorithm (Selby’s) at all, even in a way that won’t scale.
Scott’s central thesis is that although it is possible there could be a turning point past 2000 qubits where the D-Wave will beat our best classical alternative, none of the data collected so far suggests that. So it’s possible that a 4000 qubit D-Wave machine will exhibit this trend, but there is no evidence of it (yet) from examining a 2000 qubit machine. Scott’s central gripe with D-Wave’s approach is that they don’t have any even pie-in-the-sky theoretical reason to expect this to happen, and scaling up quantum computers without breaking the entire process is much harder than for classical computers so making them even bigger doesn’t seem like a solution.
(2) DWave machines are NOT gate quantum computers; they call their machine quantum annealing machines. It is not known the complexity class of problems that can be solved efficiently by quantum annealing machines, or if that class is equivalent to classical machines.
The result shows that the DWave machine is asymptotically faster than the Simulated Annealing algorithm (yay!), which suggests that it is executing the Quantum Annealing algorithm. However, the paper also explicitly states that this does not mean that the Dwave machine is exhibiting a ‘quantum speedup’. To do this, they would need to show it to outperform the best known classical algorithm, which as the paper acknowledges, it does not.
What the paper does seem to be showing is that the machine in question is actually fundamentally quantum in nature; it’s just not clear yet that that the type of quantum computer it is is an improvement over classical ones.
(3) [I]t isn’t called out in the linked blog since by now Scott probably considers it basic background information, but D-Wave only solves a very particular problem, and it is both not entirely clear that it has a superior solution to that problem than a classical algorithm can obtain and it is not clear that encoding real problems into that problem will not end up costing you all of the gains itself. Really pragmatic applications are still a ways into the future. It’s hard to imagine what they might be when we’re still so early in the process, and still have no good idea what either the practical or theoretical limits are.
(4) The popular perception of quantum computers as “doing things in parallel” is very misleading. A quantum computer lets you perform computation on a superposed state while maintaining that superposition. But that only helps if the structure of the problem lets you somehow “cancel out” the incorrect results leaving you with the single correct one.

143,2516,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2516,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2015-10-30,Scott Aaronson,A breakthrough on QMA(2)?,"Last night, Martin Schwarz posted a preprint to the arXiv that claims to show the new complexity class containment QMA(2) ⊆ EXP. (See also his brief blog post about this result.) Here QMA(2) means Quantum Merlin-Arthur with two Merlins—i.e., the set of languages for which a “yes” answer can be witnessed by two unentangled quantum states, |ψ〉⊗|φ〉, on polynomially many qubits each, which are checked by a polynomial-time quantum algorithm—while EXP means deterministic exponential time. Previously, the best upper bound we had was the trivial QMA(2) ⊆ NEXP (Nondeterministic Exponential Time), which comes from guessing exponential-size classical descriptions of the two quantum proofs.
Whether QMA(2) is contained in EXP is a problem that had fascinated me for a decade. With Salman Beigi, Andy Drucker, Bill Fefferman, and Peter Shor, we discussed this problem in our 2008 paper The Power of Unentanglement. That paper (with an additional ingredient supplied by Harrow and Montanaro) shows how to prove that a 3SAT instance of size n is satisfiable, using two unentangled quantum proofs with only Õ(√n) qubits each. This implies that searching over all n-qubit unentangled proofs must take at least exp(n2) time, unless 3SAT is solvable in 2o(n) time (i.e., unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis is false). However, since EXP is defined as the set of problems solvable in 2p(n) time, for any polynomial p, this is no barrier to QMA(2) ⊆ EXP being true—it merely constrains the possible techniques that could prove such a containment.
In trying to prove QMA(2) ⊆ EXP, the fundamental difficulty is that you need to optimize over unentangled quantum states only. That might sound easier than optimizing over all states (including the entangled ones), but ironically, it’s harder! The reason why it’s harder is that optimizing over all quantum states (say, to find the one that’s accepted by some measurement with the maximum probability) is a convex optimization problem: in fact, it boils down to finding the principal eigenvector of a Hermitian matrix. By contrast, optimizing over only the separable states is a non-convex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve exactly (treating the dimension of the Hilbert space as the input size n)—meaning that the question shifts to what sorts of approximations are possible.
Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking with Martin in person, when I visited Vienna, Austria to give a public lecture at the wonderful new research institute IST. Martin was then ironing out some final wrinkles in his proof, and I got to watch him in action—in particular, to see the care and detachment with which he examined the possibility that his proof might imply too much (e.g., that NP-complete problems are solvable in quasipolynomial time). Fortunately, his proof turned out not to imply anything of the kind.
The reason why it didn’t is directly related to the most striking feature of Martin’s proof—namely, that it’s non-relativizing, leaving completely open the question of whether QMA(2)A ⊆ EXPA relative to all oracles A. To explain how this is possible requires saying a bit about how the proof works. The obvious way to prove QMA(2) ⊆ EXP—what I had assumed from the beginning was the only realistic way—would be to give a quasipolynomial-time approximation algorithm for the so-called Best Separable State or BSS problem. The BSS problem, as defined in this paper by Russell Impagliazzo, Dana Moshkovitz, and myself (see also this one by Barak et al.), is as follows: you’re given as input an n2×n2 Hermitian matrix A, with all its eigenvalues in [0,1]. Your goal is to find length-n unit vectors, u and w, that maximize
(uT⊗wT)A(u⊗w),
to within an additive error of ±ε, for some constant ε.
Of course, if we just asked for a length-n2 unit vector v that maximized vTAv, we’d be asking for the principal eigenvector of A, which is easy to find in polynomial time. By contrast, from the ABDFS and Harrow-Montanaro results, it follows that the BSS problem, for constant ε, cannot be solved in poly(n) time, unless 3SAT is solvable in 2o(n) time. But this still leaves the possibility that BSS is solvable in nlog(n) time—and that possibility would immediately imply QMA(2) ⊆ EXP. So, as I and others saw it, the real challenge here was to find a quasipolynomial-time approximation algorithm for BSS—something that remained elusive, although Brandao-Christandl-Yard made partial progress towards it.
But now Martin comes along, and proves QMA(2) ⊆ EXP in a way that sidesteps the BSS problem. The way he does it is by using the fact that, if a problem is in QMA(2), then we don’t merely know a Hermitian operator A corresponding to the measurement of |ψ〉⊗|φ〉: rather, we know an actual polynomial-size sequence of quantum gates that get multiplied together to produce A. Using that fact, Chailloux and Sattath showed that a natural variant of the QMA-complete Local Hamiltonians problem, which they call Separable Sparse Hamiltonians, is complete for QMA(2). Thus, it suffices for Martin to show how to solve the Separable Sparse Hamiltonians problem in singly-exponential time. This he does by using perturbation theory gadgets to reduce Separable Sparse Hamiltonians to Separable Local Hamiltonians with an exponentially-small promise gap, and then using a result of Shi and Wu to solve the latter problem in singly-exponential time. All in all, given the significance of the advance, Martin’s paper is remarkably short; a surprising amount of it boils down to deeply understanding some not-especially-well-known results that were already in the literature.
One obvious problem left open is whether the full BSS problem—rather than just the special case of it corresponding to QMA(2)—is solvable in quasipolynomial time after all. A second obvious problem is whether the containment QMA(2) ⊆ EXP can be improved to QMA(2) ⊆ PSPACE, or even (say) QMA(2) ⊆ PP. (By comparison, note that QMA ⊆ PP, by a result of Kitaev and Watrous.)
Update (Nov. 10): I thought I should let people know that a serious concern has been raised by an expert about the correctness of the proof—and in particular, about the use of perturbation theory gadgets. Martin tells me that he’s working on a fix, and I very much hope he’ll succeed, but not much to do for now except let the scientific process trundle along (which doesn’t happen at blog-speed).",6378,"['41772eb85bcc0a23480c2effc244d29caabb737af71165c695aa9d3e9eca9485', '52349635233ab75666d8998656f7f4921cfc6ac02c02561e68572950085be9f4', '3f3ed684bc59025c13f0b4dbee80213c48288d5223f3bc8d09f90958caadc937', '8f6ea52ffe48c30f4bec47ad802009369c8d745a3b9308c6643049b42f142c5c', 'd9b7f5bccb7781e958868d633a31640d3e8c8012bfcba1599c7155bcf686125f', '5f5d66d528e4dd9da7880bc88553e61ce1847ea4f00674885c4484c766b46cd5', '5e056985c3634970f436c63cca417511fcfeb4aa7d11916c1e5d3205e475fd26', 'b5fc0beef4e606c89ba10c2f2ddbc3fcd346674f2ff4aa0dbf79948d752f9d0c', '76c1c6ae5b309e6139b4a896aa5b95e709446827b3e1a56b350bc99c96700c4d', '8cb60d8cbf48976deb8390649992900b96e0db5cc34e2351d517a1b732d1acad', '88476c97750189d10a6f6e5c881a2687b46aad352bde2c3a5df0c7455ada8668', '61e8914c921a98bb54b5cb5dbd97cb6da4ed62a61549af665d20414730c88b49', '32e7cda325ba651e2d9f8ad4bd14c690f06a93fc78c835649b67ed299e85d2cb', '5b2f8dd79fb03b94f8da516fdc4b25be5dc318f635b81bf9beb77f7cbb128ffa', '6f297415cecc26d76546d2b1e77d698c3beb35fd220fc5e83e5a83a94e74f5bd', 'e2b25f10ed1791c41cec1f29aa24c31e1a78dc04174e62c835d7acdaa943f699', '5c6ac840e3eec0210f3ac901f3187093a6643c52f14042e98a6af784db13261d', '0119cf2908d391c6f6600467ccc8e7842546014cd097ad7e578d7e5f4cf5d711', '5a0f636957a2cd7a5a1039514da75e1bafb710016f318d0f90341ed80e5e75c1', 'd02a74de165e25e6262ce6a37df06034eab464fe55990b46a9f34fcd75b0940b', '7111500f2011ced8f22c066f47db02f7aae7d0e1819c83a709921ddbda9a9c10', '7111500f2011ced8f22c066f47db02f7aae7d0e1819c83a709921ddbda9a9c10', '4ced689ee4c62b60d16f1551b52a558288739b164ca9502c6aa585ea7f370178', '2cba6436d0bddf8fe3eea8af5e0392b0a7c17abbb429f7451e6daca45bcf7d02']"
144,2487,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2487,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2015-09-22,Scott Aaronson,Six announcements,"- I did a podcast interview with Julia Galef for her series “Rationally Speaking.” See also here for the transcript (which I read rather than having to listen to myself stutter). The interview is all about Aumann’s Theorem, and whether rational people can agree to disagree. It covers a lot of the same ground as my recent post on the same topic, except with less technical detail about agreement theory and more … well, agreement. At Julia’s suggestion, we’re planning to do a follow-up podcast about the particular intractability of online disagreements. I feel confident that we’ll solve that problem once and for all. (Update: Also check out this YouTube video, where Julia offers additional thoughts about what we discussed.)
- When Julia asked me to recommend a book at the end of the interview, I picked probably my favorite contemporary novel: The Mind-Body Problem by Rebecca Newberger Goldstein. Embarrassingly, I hadn’t realized that Rebecca had already been on Julia’s show twice as a guest! Anyway, one of the thrills of my life over the last year has been to get to know Rebecca a little, as well as her husband, who’s some guy named Steve Pinker. Like, they both live right here in Boston! You can talk to them! I was especially pleased two weeks ago to learn that Rebecca won the National Humanities Medal—as I told Julia, Rebecca Goldstein getting a medal at the White House is the sort of thing I imagine happening in my ideal fantasy world, making it a pleasant surprise that it happened in this one. Huge congratulations to Rebecca!
- The NSA has released probably its most explicit public statement so far about its plans to move to quantum-resistant cryptography. For more see Bruce Schneier’s Crypto-Gram. Hat tip for this item goes to reader Ole Aamot, one of the only people I’ve ever encountered whose name alphabetically precedes mine.
- Last Tuesday, I got to hear Ayaan Hirsi Ali speak at MIT about her new book, Heretic, and then spend almost an hour talking to students who had come to argue with her. I found her clear, articulate, and courageous (as I guess one has to be in her line of work, even with armed cops on either side of the lecture hall). After the shameful decision of Brandeis in caving in to pressure and cancelling Hirsi Ali’s commencement speech, I thought it spoke well of MIT that they let her speak at all. The bar shouldn’t be that low, but it is.
- From far away on the political spectrum, I also heard Noam Chomsky talk last week (my first time hearing him live), about the current state of linguistics. Much of the talk, it struck me, could have been given in the 1950s with essentially zero change (and I suspect Chomsky would agree), though a few parts of it were newer, such as the speculation that human languages have many of the features they do in order to minimize the amount of computation that the speaker needs to perform. The talk was full of declarations that there had been no useful work whatsoever on various questions (e.g., about the evolutionary function of language), that they were total mysteries and would perhaps remain total mysteries forever.
- Many of you have surely heard by now that Terry Tao solved the Erdös Discrepancy Problem, by showing that for every infinite sequence of heads and tails and every positive integer C, there’s a positive integer k such that, if you look at the subsequence formed by every kth flip, there comes a point where the heads outnumber tails or vice versa by at least C. This resolves a problem that’s been open for more than 80 years. For more details, see this post by Timothy Gowers. Notably, Tao’s proof builds, in part, on a recent Polymath collaborative online effort. It was a big deal last year when Konev and Lisitsa used a SAT-solver to prove that there’s always a subsequence with discrepancy at least 3; Tao’s result now improves on that bound by ∞.",3879,"['90a82c0ac983b6eeb31110fd2616fb58218a0354352418956aa30cba89d6a929', '4736992561eed55027307b755231b53c2336df7e9f64ae242a0cef6afc06c576', 'ff3df4369fd48508c70654485c624e00502aecb023e8e98143c8190e51969c81', 'e798b73962721bd9b8a0be51fc541aea2bf4a31ca97685d80967e9a7b36aea95', 'c7d36061df53e48fccc2d6332d08e2e82051f99cf6af49ffb58c3d7cdba93cf7', '12918268ab34eb96b1d9c7c8c0884739b64c774deb44b1a8a2f3b6def7a8c954', 'bdd0fd9059f3d9dc440f1889d98d8d73deb60eecd0ba21a2a11ab41bc5aa99b0', '2cfc37ae8d69ac4455ba651c85b44afb224581027121ec3c41d325c6ac0aad2a', 'a7b45d41fdacf20665289c1df9b75f3d1528708a50baa383131f40e24af05453', 'e531cc3dcb6c7982725910b898136a38b7c69b7a0947debe5f0c0c6c9dab368e', '15b3650c1944c9bd2cf8815c904a80515a470f4ad7907d3db4f7f47e4bfeacb3', '86f0ab7bc8f0cf485d2116587bbd9ec0cf4a45b7fea4766943bca65f22706cea', '91fd8456ed01b9d6869a31ccf3adf2daa9e54bc72e368dcac35de76234e577fa', 'de69304e399e5d21bcb11b98042dba30d655f8cf81c33ab23697062ec91c8990', '002733de2f2f837bfab9840cbea7f74c12994a5223fe4bb3d7d402f27a15305b', 'e85ec98f1c7478ca10e47ade579ffc5543823bf12f6991b9b4faf8565b00b6c3', 'd51f7a32611cf52466ad6c4f552307293ce6767c79d9d29727fe7de0214c4683', 'f7fa255f09d698fab2473ef8fa5e3aa8faffe24a4b4e77dbdb9a3b376031d59f', 'd1fb656e0ad7259bf2c35688d3baea66592235588ed5048f59c32c741b79c366', '2d989d8ff7fb613d6e55a81c169f0a82ee231160f7007ca2180e2003e40ab8ff', 'cf6930fb58d7b23cbcd444e40a4789f56ab376b5a493b7dbe44d61b3e2f29083', 'a253be1a176c4d1798a80b92ccaa9fd53e92fc7e9d5a31e86c79cb0f330ee025', '4441827b1fd45553cdc56c30870401f72e9913885d5022d429e118929fee2fc1', '1d3ffebd8e0cef9ad22e02c5a8eaf69db3da91ddc45877ea6e85514962becee3', '1dfbe0aa7b4a1a74aa3dba8388a8b0cba50e1d18e4bf90fbacfdeec84110769e', '45bf8bd28130b954a3afd7a1e3ba07e046c048d0e73c36fc7ee7f124638c49dd', '8c5ed00973408c009d65c4260a68126baff7cc4332b33fd2904d212d3d29995d', 'b2e357407f8ccb696f160993b6ffd55b679e069d3ad520785d571d2a8367fe87', '8bb37fbcb9de29315772e4a4d448d2305c5c66332da1c259fdbe44e5a6bef12b', 'f759fc71741835858b7bc050f92fafcee38d68a3a45571319990e880749e0e40', '5a8312edce28e4e4015c9a80c3a63ad1389ed6fec99763189f8e8677ea51657e', '199d73b583282b76c892896d2f99053297ee7f1027b089f4e60f765827abd1fa', '821d263e8b37c847d5caa36e850fee58a0840b54ccbb04cb8384a751f54bf417', '12392f4eb3ba4ac17f3f802e09ac3dcc0e32314b14fc715f77597584d7368456', 'd2de8e8b85dc7432ca10471512057bda601ead61f15ff714021604f84afa66fa', 'cb86aaff5eb1083dab407781d67212b376749802dd4918be226f8e86c83de22b', 'c2e63b1fa6a7f5e17e6bf58850fd04c280076d4286c55866e28f83ef052ec280', 'd98893bdda4e7144d4e50709c4aef43898fc7822c751e6179aebb71f59f27fc0', 'e5d4e09244d6019273dd903830bc68082be26688057589aa7ae65ae38fffece1', '2f90dc453d5b9c9b34784f2310d35539a6efb75450ceec49a29cf086c9f39484', 'cd503862df8d15c66b05a8d0462f77880bad22dd9cf98cf033ceafa6997a67bc']"

Well, at least with ~96% confidence. This is big news, not only because of the result itself, but because of the advances in experimental technique needed to achieve it. Last Friday, two renowned experimentalists—Chris Monroe of U. of Maryland and Jungsang Kim of Duke—visited MIT, and in addition to talking about their own exciting ion-trap work, they did a huge amount to help me understand the new Bell test experiment. So OK, let me try to explain this.
While some people like to make it more complicated, the Bell inequality is the following statement. Alice and Bob are cooperating with each other to win a certain game (the “CHSH game“) with the highest possible probability. They can agree on a strategy and share information and particles in advance, but then they can’t communicate once the game starts. Alice gets a uniform random bit x, and Bob gets a uniform random bit y (independent of x). Their goal is to output bits, a and b respectively, such that a XOR b = x AND y: in other words, such that a and b are different if and only if x and y are both 1. The Bell inequality says that, in any universe that satisfies the property of local realism, no matter which strategy they use, Alice and Bob can win the game at most 75% of the time (for example, by always outputting a=b=0).
What does local realism mean? It means that, after she receives her input x, any experiment Alice can perform in her lab has a definite result that might depend on x, on the state of her lab, and on whatever information she pre-shared with Bob, but at any rate, not on Bob’s input y. If you like: a=a(x,w) is a function of x and of the information w available before the game started, but is not a function of y. Likewise, b=b(y,w) is a function of y and w, but not of x. Perhaps the best way to explain local realism is that it’s the thing you believe in, if you believe all the physicists babbling about “quantum entanglement” just missed something completely obvious. Clearly, at the moment two “entangled” particles are created, but before they separate, one of them flips a tiny coin and then says to the other, “listen, if anyone asks, I’ll be spinning up and you’ll be spinning down.” Then the naïve, doofus physicists measure one particle, find it spinning down, and wonder how the other particle instantly “knows” to be spinning up—oooh, spooky! mysterious! Anyway, if that’s how you think it has to work, then you believe in local realism, and you must predict that Alice and Bob can win the CHSH game with probability at most 3/4.
What Bell observed in 1964 is that, even though quantum mechanics doesn’t let Alice send a signal to Bob (or vice versa) faster than the speed of light, it still makes a prediction about the CHSH game that conflicts with local realism. (And thus, quantum mechanics exhibits what one might not have realized beforehand was even a logical possibility: it doesn’t allow communication faster than light, but simulating the predictions of quantum mechanics in a classical universe would require faster-than-light communication.) In particular, if Alice and Bob share entangled qubits, say $$\frac{\left| 00 \right\rangle + \left| 11 \right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}},$$ then there’s a simple protocol that lets them violate the Bell inequality, winning the CHSH game ~85% of the time (with probability (1+1/√2)/2 > 3/4). Starting in the 1970s, people did experiments that vindicated the prediction of quantum mechanics, and falsified local realism—or so the story goes.
The violation of the Bell inequality has a schizophrenic status in physics. To many of the physicists I know, Nature’s violating the Bell inequality is so trivial and obvious that it’s barely even worth doing the experiment: if people had just understood and believed Bohr and Heisenberg back in 1925, there would’ve been no need for this whole tiresome discussion. To others, however, the Bell inequality violation remains so unacceptable that some way must be found around it—from casting doubt on the experiments that have been done, to overthrowing basic presuppositions of science (e.g., our own “freedom” to generate random bits x and y to send to Alice and Bob respectively).
For several decades, there was a relatively conservative way out for local realist diehards, and that was to point to “loopholes”: imperfections in the existing experiments which meant that local realism was still theoretically compatible with the results, at least if one was willing to assume a sufficiently strange conspiracy.
Fine, you interject, but surely no one literally believed these little experimental imperfections would be the thing that would rescue local realism? Not so fast. Right here, on this blog, I’ve had people point to the loopholes as a reason to accept local realism and reject the reality of quantum entanglement. See, for example, the numerous comments by Teresa Mendes in my Whether Or Not God Plays Dice, I Do post. Arguing with Mendes back in 2012, I predicted that the two main loopholes would both be closed in a single experiment—and not merely eventually, but in, like, a decade. I was wrong: achieving this milestone took only a few years.
Before going further, let’s understand what the two main loopholes are (or rather, were).
The locality loophole arises because the measuring process takes time and Alice and Bob are not infinitely far apart. Thus, suppose that, the instant Alice starts measuring her particle, a secret signal starts flying toward Bob’s particle at the speed of light, revealing her choice of measurement setting (i.e., the value of x). Likewise, the instant Bob starts measuring his particle, his doing so sends a secret signal flying toward Alice’s particle, revealing the value of y. By the time the measurements are finished, a few microseconds later, there’s been plenty of time for the two particles to coordinate their responses to the measurements, despite being “classical under the hood.”
Meanwhile, the detection loophole arises because in practice, measurements of entangled particles—especially of photons—don’t always succeed in finding the particles, let alone ascertaining their properties. So one needs to select those runs of the experiment where Alice and Bob both find the particles, and discard all the “bad” runs where they don’t. This by itself wouldn’t be a problem, if not for the fact that the very same measurement that reveals whether the particles are there, is also the one that “counts” (i.e., where Alice and Bob feed x and y and get out a and b)!
To someone with a conspiratorial mind, this opens up the possibility that the measurement’s success or failure is somehow correlated with its result, in a way that could violate the Bell inequality despite there being no real entanglement. To illustrate, suppose that at the instant they’re created, one entangled particle says to the other: “listen, if Alice measures me in the x=0 basis, I’ll give the a=1 result. If Bob measures you in the y=1 basis, you give the b=1 result. In any other case, we’ll just evade detection and count this run as a loss.” In such a case, Alice and Bob will win the game with certainty, whenever it gets played at all—but that’s only because of the particles’ freedom to choose which rounds will count. Indeed, by randomly varying their “acceptable” x and y values from one round to the next, the particles can even make it look like x and y have no effect on the probability of a round’s succeeding.
Until a month ago, the state-of-the-art was that there were experiments that closed the locality loophole, and other experiments that closed the detection loophole, but there was no single experiment that closed both of them.
To close the locality loophole, “all you need” is a fast enough measurement on photons that are far enough apart. That way, even if the vast Einsteinian conspiracy is trying to send signals between Alice’s and Bob’s particles at the speed of light, to coordinate the answers classically, the whole experiment will be done before the signals can possibly have reached their destinations. Admittedly, as Nicolas Gisin once pointed out to me, there’s a philosophical difficulty in defining what we mean by the experiment being “done.” To some purists, a Bell experiment might only be “done” once the results (i.e., the values of a and b) are registered in human experimenters’ brains! And given the slowness of human reaction times, this might imply that a real Bell experiment ought to be carried out with astronauts on faraway space stations, or with Alice on the moon and Bob on earth (which, OK, would be cool). If we’re being reasonable, however, we can grant that the experiment is “done” once a and b are safely recorded in classical, macroscopic computer memories—in which case, given the speed of modern computer memories, separating Alice and Bob by half a kilometer can be enough. And indeed, experiments starting in 1998 (see for example here) have done exactly that;
the current record, unless I’m mistaken, is 18 kilometers. (Update: I was mistaken; it’s 144 kilometers.) Alas, since these experiments used hard-to-measure photons, they were still open to the detection loophole.
To close the detection loophole, the simplest approach is to use entangled qubits that (unlike photons) are slow and heavy and can be measured with success probability approaching 1. That’s exactly what various groups did starting in 2001 (see for example here), with trapped ions, superconducting qubits, and other systems. Alas, given current technology, these sorts of qubits are virtually impossible to move miles apart from each other without decohering them. So the experiments used qubits that were close together, leaving the locality loophole wide open.
So the problem boils down to: how do you create long-lasting, reliably-measurable entanglement between particles that are very far apart (e.g., in separate labs)? There are three basic ideas in Hensen et al.’s solution to this problem.
The first idea is to use a hybrid system. Ultimately, Hensen et al. create entanglement between electron spins in nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond (one of the hottest—or coolest?—experimental quantum information platforms today), in two labs that are about a mile away from each other. To get these faraway electron spins to talk to each other, they make them communicate via photons. If you stimulate an electron, it’ll sometimes emit a photon with which it’s entangled. Very occasionally, the two electrons you care about will even emit photons at the same time. In those cases, by routing those photons into optical fibers and then measuring the photons, it’s possible to entangle the electrons.
Wait, what? How does measuring the photons entangle the electrons from whence they came? This brings us to the second idea, entanglement swapping. The latter is a famous procedure to create entanglement between two particles A and B that have never interacted, by “merely” entangling A with another particle A’, entangling B with another particle B’, and then performing an entangled measurement on A’ and B’ and conditioning on its result. To illustrate, consider the state
$$ \frac{\left| 00 \right\rangle + \left| 11 \right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \otimes \frac{\left| 00 \right\rangle + \left| 11 \right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} $$
and now imagine that we project the first and third qubits onto the state $$\frac{\left| 00 \right\rangle + \left| 11 \right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.$$
If the measurement succeeds, you can check that we’ll be left with the state $$\frac{\left| 00 \right\rangle + \left| 11 \right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$$ in the second and fourth qubits, even though those qubits were not entangled before.
So to recap: these two electron spins, in labs a mile away from each other, both have some probability of producing a photon. The photons, if produced, are routed to a third site, where if they’re both there, then an entangled measurement on both of them (and a conditioning on the results of that measurement) has some nonzero probability of causing the original electron spins to become entangled.
But there’s a problem: if you’ve been paying attention, all we’ve done is cause the electron spins to become entangled with some tiny, nonzero probability (something like 6.4×10-9 in the actual experiment). So then, why is this any improvement over the previous experiments, which just directly measured faraway entangled photons, and also had some small but nonzero probability of detecting them?
This leads to the third idea. The new setup is an improvement because, whenever the photon measurement succeeds, we know that the electron spins are there and that they’re entangled, without having to measure the electron spins to tell us that. In other words, we’ve decoupled the measurement that tells us whether we succeeded in creating an entangled pair, from the measurement that uses the entangled pair to violate the Bell inequality. And because of that decoupling, we can now just condition on the runs of the experiment where the entangled pair was there, without worrying that that will open up the detection loophole, biasing the results via some bizarre correlated conspiracy. It’s as if the whole experiment were simply switched off, except for those rare lucky occasions when an entangled spin pair gets created (with its creation heralded by the photons). On those rare occasions, Alice and Bob swing into action, measuring their respective spins within the brief window of time—about 4 microseconds—allowed by the locality loophole, seeking an additional morsel of evidence that entanglement is real. (Well, actually, Alice and Bob swing into action regardless; they only find out later whether this was one of the runs that “counted.”)
So, those are the main ideas (as well as I understand them); then there’s lots of engineering. In their setup, Hensen et al. were able to create just a few heralded entangled pairs per hour. This allowed them to produce 245 CHSH games for Alice and Bob to play, and to reject the hypothesis of local realism at ~96% confidence. Jungsang Kim explained to me that existing technologies could have produced many more events per hour, and hence, in a similar amount of time, “particle physics” (5σ or more) rather than “psychology” (2σ) levels of confidence that local realism is false. But in this type of experiment, everything is a tradeoff. Building not one but two labs for manipulating NV centers in diamond is extremely onerous, and Hensen et al. did what they had to do to get a significant result.
The basic idea here, of using photons to entangle longer-lasting qubits, is useful for more than pulverizing local realism. In particular, the idea is a major part of current proposals for how to build a scalable ion-trap quantum computer. Because of cross-talk, you can’t feasibly put more than 10 or so ions in the same trap while keeping all of them coherent and controllable. So the current ideas for scaling up involve having lots of separate traps—but in that case, one will sometimes need to perform a Controlled-NOT, or some other 2-qubit gate, between a qubit in one trap and a qubit in another. This can be achieved using the Gottesman-Chuang technique of gate teleportation, provided you have reliable entanglement between the traps. But how do you create such entanglement? Aha: the current idea is to entangle the ions by using photons as intermediaries, very similar in spirit to what Hensen et al. do.
At a more fundamental level, will this experiment finally convince everyone that local realism is dead, and that quantum mechanics might indeed be the operating system of reality? Alas, I predict that those who confidently predicted that a loophole-free Bell test could never be done, will simply find some new way to wiggle out, without admitting the slightest problem for their previous view. This prediction, you might say, is based on a different kind of realism.",16184,"['983233c553a46a2d9b9083f5144975132dc1a2e59fcecc120447a65bcb603904',

146,2448,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2448,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2015-08-26,Scott Aaronson,D-Wave Open Thread,"A bunch of people have asked me to comment on D-Wave’s release of its 1000-qubit processor, and a paper by a group including Cathy McGeoch saying that the machine is 1 or 2 orders of faster (in annealing time, not wall-clock time) than simulated annealing running on a single-core classical computer. It’s even been suggested that the “Scott-signal” has been shining brightly for a week above Quantham City, but that Scott-man has been too lazy and out-of-shape even to change into his tights.
Scientifically, it’s not clear if much has changed. D-Wave now has a chip with twice as many qubits as the last one. That chip continues to be pretty effective at finding its own low-energy states: indeed, depending on various details of definition, the machine can even find its own low-energy states “faster” than some implementation of simulated annealing running on a single-core chip. Of course, it’s entirely possible that Matthias Troyer or Sergei Isakov or Troels Ronnow or someone like that will be able to find a better implementation of simulated annealing that closes even the modest gap—as happened the last time—but I’ll give the authors the benefit of the doubt that they put good-faith effort into optimizing the classical code.
More importantly, I’d say it remains unclear whether any of the machine’s performance on the instances tested here can be attributed to quantum tunneling effects. In fact, the paper explicitly states (see page 3) that it’s not going to consider such questions, and I think the authors would agree that you could very well see results like theirs, even if what was going on was fundamentally classical annealing. Also, of course, it’s still true that, if you wanted to solve a practical optimization problem, you’d first need to encode it into the Chimera graph, and that reduction entails a loss that could hand a decisive advantage to simulated annealing, even without the need to go to multiple cores. (This is what I’ve described elsewhere as essentially all of these performance comparisons taking place on “the D-Wave machine’s home turf”: that is, on binary constraint satisfaction problems that have precisely the topology of D-Wave’s Chimera graph.)
But, I dunno, I’m just not feeling the urge to analyze this in more detail. Part of the reason is that I think the press might be getting less hyper-excitable these days, thereby reducing the need for a Chief D-Wave Skeptic. By this point, there may have been enough D-Wave announcements that papers realize they no longer need to cover each one like an extraterrestrial landing. And there are more hats in the ring now, with John Martinis at Google seeking to build superconducting quantum annealing machines but with ~10,000x longer coherence times than D-Wave’s, and with IBM Research and some others also trying to scale superconducting QC. The realization has set in, I think, that both D-Wave and the others are in this for the long haul, with D-Wave currently having lots of qubits, but with very short coherence times and unclear prospects for any quantum speedup, and Martinis and some others having qubits of far higher quality, but not yet able to couple enough of them.
The other issue is that, on my flight from Seoul back to Newark, I watched two recent kids’ movies that were almost defiant in their simple, unironic, 1950s-style messages of hope and optimism. One was Disney’s new live-action Cinderella; the other was Brad Bird’s Tomorrowland. And seeing these back-to-back filled me with such positivity and good will that, at least for these few hours, it’s hard to summon my usual crusty self. I say, let’s invent the future together, and build flying cars and jetpacks in our garages! Let a thousand creative ideas bloom for how to tackle climate change and the other crises facing civilization! (Admittedly, mass-market flying cars and jetpacks are probably not a step forward on climate change … but, see, there’s that negativity coming back.) And let another thousand ideas bloom for how to build scalable quantum computers—sure, including D-Wave’s! Have courage and be kind!
So yeah, if readers would like to discuss the recent D-Wave paper further (especially those who know something about it), they’re more than welcome to do so in the comments section. But I’ve been away from Dana and Lily for two weeks, and will endeavor to spend time with them rather than obsessively reloading the comments (let’s see if I succeed).
As a small token of my goodwill, I enclose two photos from my last visit to a D-Wave machine, which occurred when I met with some grad students in Waterloo this past spring. As you can see, I even personally certified that the machine was operating as expected. But more than that: surpassing all reasonable expectations for quantum AI, this model could actually converse intelligently, through a protruding head resembling that of IQC grad student Sarah Kaiser.",4909,"['28ff6412c251a2b1fca3ddd75959922033eb57c8276a5ec48cd84f7973352702', '3063d4742c4f6a0ba98e69281efaa82f4ffc39ce301b5ae7a13fdfb54e8267e8', '41c9366cae63538ed34223ca5a475112ead8eb407163172407308652c7482197', 'c5ffbe59f919895153a95075bc3e9dff784a19b861770a064b2f008444b5cdd0', 'af111c01306a0d2f809fea5a21016ef652ab5bb3dd377a0c7338ec99c0c5c60f', 'aa287bd390e77a9c2fe1eb225bf514bef9a2778fc9b27ee9e1d25990b70422fa', '7bec4dcc4a8a095384d4a37a406c88dad80595b51027e6ab06ab21e92be0c216', 'c128fbc6ff27f25f6b60a4de883f641c5d6987e59029a98ab9f6c3c983383b6b', '656d4cdec9905effbacd3249de53254f368fe70b0fa36f817b1bd6f45992471f', 'a91c3e2b2e24716df1d3e1e4ec9699b5dc89889bb4d22c9691cebd88de9f39f7', 'b1f4a28cd8b9048a1f7d62ba7bf73b5049160523287bb9dbb657ca1072089f9f', 'ec056ab49a0a17a7f3af0ae0d52e80363fd1580661a852ec13c90e177cc1a1b5', '6855459fca3db4050b89d07578443c9dddeaa49773cdeb47d0e2f32c6c471bd0', '44b72caa8f6da25b5a78418dfaf28301f96caba35bd14acbdd4c8056b5a7b52f', 'afdaf5d465b90df0ddb9b0f20210a42363149a176674104d6a738536d31fad0c', '1b2dfd1f5f81b8bde9463eee60919d190bb7b19634963d292b4f63dce1753da8', 'de0c78fb14d1eddb993e56f3f96ac26fe768f5eb61ade3fa602c9107e82b5935', '945c1cfb2460da216ab7bb7afca10a9bb94ee345ff7f09dc9d4de41f9e362f20', '66f42273ef396cd2edc548ef6a6044848ce5a08fe9ccbaf476fe2726d9087d7d', '00bce415d8d03bdcd39d01c2f178c479c05030312c564f1a514049798e6cad68', '201dc50be74829a2e27a3ff0811f30dd0d576acecbab2f8d145060ecea61cdab', 'd56fb2ac0630919d404efbbff74408d9c127a9cec2edd64a4600899745fa9355', '00d9788fa78d69ce51f89ad223261794133dac36957d51803aa3ed2588efdd56', '25355bc0e5220553a7dfaf505b6efa3e8cfed707a8a69237b3da7c41befe01e1', '417b4032afa59928365fc85f5b7e4852ee757bb34b0db0a37469acbae6a48e9e', 'e9dacc10736ff04551996746b91dfac5b146914455c97ec60c43fff907a53b17', '46fa4ee211e631923fc31720f6034b9e9ce2ac9de979a91dd982ed429c1696d3', '01aa5e349b245671ae520ca499216e593d515ce713615a900afe9fcd37841db4', 'c23e9a4c02ea35b67101327ea9bfb4b6e1d68d29c38f1ff3d5b53419df83ee30', '82b6e40344500c0b0f29d805a07074ade8dc74f5ca2253e4a9a16d4257e9bb3b', '99968e2b9c6c6c002bb72be7bed1f649be64385bb28a75a3db1c302912b7e4c8', '76652cfa89334bf7d7189de519c5386dbe7913189127c0db16c2f8b44bfc9eb1', '9333b21772df3e1bfa570bdb0c40898157bf47df614466d4b8d3bb7e9f0f77b9', '024ade36050d22e261e055bb44e2ff7c97db07189f1e955bbb8b3e79ee8ebf81', '1be10e7faeda0d0700f2f84d34ff70a62bd8d7c896884280fef48db147a9612e', '46305d7ca50a6b1148c14c3c8f0b0fdc9317df8d81c9a145fbb2af8275ba3ce8', '63c677f88d2d3931990a2be6425c86fbd0f06c8b5991f02903deaed96afcb3b8', 'a14f3776c86501cafcc9e1a25e3e08a88aea355479d2e2b7957b253de0093192', 'c73d43122b587185e789b673c9ef0cc6d60c5bcb1a7a963224e7e35ad3c32229', 'f7ee967fd3874c25c056f604440a28d65d77e2b255d3ee6b24e75861fd698bc4', '407f6f0b6c7147533eff55a4196fbcd7c51b2aebfcbb4ea7bb7f1ae5edef397a', '21fc264f6976b6b536af0f3acf53af4c2da293ab748488a200060f326198a826', '93a53f00fdea8f4e008341d07f3cb38a28009da565ff0bd84a2c52a270725579', '6c58372c8287b9d1b3d9a1b4b77c239bae03a09e0c8ee1e372b632f2af5d337f', '7e4b4fb87921606ac04231828df90b8b0b51008e108fe21d31833b64487e1e22', '6d42e757d7bd46e4e1367b34eb7eed80572271a78baf759d84498ab88dc20b64', '0d408642a8459ec473b9c74f2561d362c9d2957cdd63c6775f8857b97265c771', 'df683e8662d9fbce001232ed0cd2340943d5c5224867747e20c7f5724b733c1e', '10c55393738ffff363b3d4bbf23d5d8324bcd1ac3c6400d66655c262615f5bd2', '0be1dd47d033405b8369e9f6bd781769eedc6d47be412e444c54a5bd0c15d3f1', '61151dc84c58cd544b170ee12bcbbb903e4052ba6f997ea2854e8d7d8d3fceaa', '3dc72a401cc6bca5e67f3b801b0d07ec800ae26440533fa19abdba43390fcc17']"

In Science, a group led by Anthony Laing at Bristol has now reported BosonSampling with 6 photons, beating their own previous record of 5 photons, as well as the earlier record of 4 photons achieved a few years ago by the Walmsley group at Oxford (as well as the 3-photon experiments done by groups around the world). I only learned the big news from a commenter on this blog, after the paper was already published (protip: if you’ve pushed forward the BosonSampling frontier, feel free to shoot me an email about it).
As several people explain in the comments, the main advance in the paper is arguably not increasing the number of photons, but rather the fact that the device is completely reconfigurable: you can try hundreds of different unitary transformations with the same chip. In addition, the 3-photon results have an unprecedentedly high fidelity (about 95%).
The 6-photon results are, of course, consistent with quantum mechanics: the transition amplitudes are indeed given by permanents of 6×6 complex matrices. Key sentence:
After collecting 15 sixfold coincidence events, a confidence of P = 0.998 was determined that these are drawn from a quantum (not classical) distribution.
No one said scaling BosonSampling would be easy: I’m guessing that it took weeks of data-gathering to get those 15 coincidence events. Scaling up further will probably require improvements to the sources.
There’s also a caveat: their initial state consisted of 2 modes with 3 photons each, as opposed to what we really want, which is 6 modes with 1 photon each. (Likewise, in the Walmsley group’s 4-photon experiments, the initial state consisted of 2 modes with 2 photons each.) If the number of modes stayed 2 forever, then the output distributions would remain easy to sample with a classical computer no matter how many photons we had, since we’d then get permanents of matrices with only 2 distinct rows. So “scaling up” needs to mean increasing not only the number of photons, but also the number of sources.
Nevertheless, this is an obvious step forward, and it came sooner than I expected. Huge congratulations to the authors on their accomplishment!
But you might ask: given that 6×6 permanents are still pretty easy for a classical computer (the more so when the matrices have only 2 distinct rows), why should anyone care? Well, the new result has major implications for what I’ve always regarded as the central goal of quantum computing research, much more important than breaking RSA or Grover search or even quantum simulation: namely, getting Gil Kalai to admit he was wrong. Gil is on record, repeatedly, on this blog as well as his (see for example here), as saying that he doesn’t think BosonSampling will ever be possible even with 7 or 8 photons. I don’t know whether the 6-photon result is giving him second thoughts (or sixth thoughts?) about that prediction.",2921,"['102fd5e065156cca359684028e9333ee856638c402a0830bed9028107d692770', 'b9359e39b7e9bd2b07b6f6398dc7e0511373679cdb85b5aa9dc9e17f2dd26aea', '9d31d05db3841e65866157e2105ddb92a2717dad27cebdc02acb3af9a411cfd3', '6857aae2b43a4e6bf4b1e28cbe3180ee492c430d4bbfee7804372b0849439988', '5d0c0cca513724ed9af68de409a77a45ee4d0a943f3ae5bea742fafba2705cb2', '72c13cf00d7d8d6e77d44eaa3ecfa247b33a3563659d2b9b24e2b604448d085e', '3f4710b9dbc1ab6ce59be73329eae61921ace03e32a2a72e9292d6766dbd07f1', 'a5e861ad95ba9cb43f3b49da1f6803992dd98b498b5b462d86975dc09ffc56a6', '6d173eea4f95c54a362d91339959336098fa8c6103ac38cf421636cecc404826', '2bf13ce1e46c5002408fcb53db4c542c8d4344c6088573a777be23801b818d46', '742829f8eeb6cb48e7f55c496ebc18c8a2b4837bb389f89aecb8c9e11baddf89', '387ae383cb9935b26bda72a1e2e3fd17c65099efb52262dec3e5d5589c98c558', '5fd8713a30d707ea1c206e2553f1e9df09a87c7cf7299886fe31f3845b426053', '0f989ddd8bc6873a5fb50f495bca01e760018a1ec76e4ba918ba54fa35267d13', 'fff3d6f01664af2f4492615963153d8ae7d80d07551914a861032761a1b82452', '1bfc9599448f5a874013303c01a7ae073ea079ef6725ded2f4540122a51a021f', '1741ba425754231e1fa17ed82e8ea3a13a29f56eba8a8e2f3fdc8d249df8311f', '0a0bd11a5bbbb79723fe3a30ac50cad83f1af5a34f905e3ab118fe56a045b64f', '007d99bc612e2f71fdc87fee8d12b66c7b0be398415098797759fd00b2711673', '4f10869e646681d4aa65bbf1bb43a099d45e1e4f42a6791b69989f9d9c820ebc', '22117244a78e7f480a65e854e38c2254b5ce90e7744ca729faade30f78d801d6', 'b862ed2177c6c5d3058d4b1c798dd76e04d4491f6b92a39de6c105ee4ced604d', '8d81a0875d0692659ab4718de01fd76b8a2b1ceff22d7d18b8de9c4530bdbef4', 'd35e7c7ea4027cef86621f0fcbd6b0315a6d1b888177ffe4b021e47a47c7878d', '074c064906b9dbf52a88d9f0324da04a091f7e1b3eae27b0ac3ec228379d6209', '658c90e6200c608d43cb55f8dec8c363579f309a4b969a052888bb0bb72c4a6f', 'a25917f034228977324cef439080764124e9d8a4fb3b61ffd1024f2f043756e0', '90c6675dd4a26f15a2e98abd1b5ec8e4e12a46dc9c04ddf33f06c65ba37513e3', '1670304782c53badc996c3935f5acf04dcc7a3c5c8acf5ecd2aef264331c4c01', '72ec749ab49144c74a1f43f587b93d521378630236daec7f926ba0f2e20755a9', '1bbfbb80db6b1aea83e3cf224e95163a859c68473ecb4d56f196114d532a294d', '12cf775f67414685c01503389bb0b19c83c315f3aeee91a43f6f0f76180880aa', 'abab99649362474252cdfc3acbec6e4755133416da05c0a725a257bd2de8b558', 'e6c4e07725100745cfe3a67d4d66f52ddb5d481e7ac156922f7ee5db842dea81']"
148,2348,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2348,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2015-07-01,Scott Aaronson,Quantum query complexity: the other shoe drops,"Two weeks ago I blogged about a breakthrough in query complexity: namely, the refutation by Ambainis et al. of a whole slew of conjectures that had stood for decades (and that I mostly believed, and that had helped draw me into theoretical computer science as a teenager) about the largest possible gaps between various complexity measures for total Boolean functions. Specifically, Ambainis et al. built on a recent example of Göös, Pitassi, and Watson to construct bizarre Boolean functions f with, among other things, near-quadratic gaps between D(f) and R0(f) (where D is deterministic query complexity and R0 is zero-error randomized query complexity), near-1.5th-power gaps between R0(f) and R(f) (where R is bounded-error randomized query complexity), and near-4th-power gaps between D(f) and Q(f) (where Q is bounded-error quantum query complexity). See my previous post for more about the definitions of these concepts and the significance of the results (and note also that Mukhopadhyay and Sanyal independently obtained weaker results).
Because my mental world was in such upheaval, in that earlier post I took pains to point out one thing that Ambainis et al. hadn’t done: namely, they still hadn’t shown any super-quadratic separation between R(f) and Q(f), for any total Boolean function f. (Recall that a total Boolean function, f:{0,1}n→{0,1}, is one that’s defined for all 2n possible input strings x∈{0,1}n. Meanwhile, a partial Boolean function is one where there’s some promise on x: for example, that x encodes a periodic sequence. When you phrase them in the query complexity model, Shor’s algorithm and other quantum algorithms achieving exponential speedups work only for partial functions, not for total ones. Indeed, a famous result of Beals et al. from 1998 says that D(f)=O(Q(f)6) for all total functions f.)
So, clinging to a slender reed of sanity, I said it “remains at least a plausible conjecture” that, if you insist on a fair comparison—i.e., bounded-error quantum versus bounded-error randomized—then the biggest speedup quantum algorithms can ever give you over classical ones, for total Boolean functions, is the square-root speedup that Grover’s algorithm easily achieves for the n-bit OR function.
Today, I can proudly report that my PhD student, Shalev Ben-David, has refuted that conjecture as well. Building on the Göös et al. and Ambainis et al. work, but adding a new twist to it, Shalev has constructed a total Boolean function f such that R(f) grows roughly like Q(f)2.5 (yes, that’s Q(f) to the 2.5th power). Furthermore, if a conjecture that Ambainis and I made in our recent “Forrelation” paper is correct—namely, that a problem called “k-fold Forrelation” has randomized query complexity roughly Ω(n1-1/k)—then one would get nearly a cubic gap between R(f) and Q(f).
The reason I found this question so interesting is that it seemed obvious to me that, to produce a super-quadratic separation between R and Q, one would need a fundamentally new kind of quantum algorithm: one that was unlike Simon’s and Shor’s algorithms in that it worked for total functions, but also unlike Grover’s algorithm in that it didn’t hit some impassable barrier at the square root of the classical running time.
Flummoxing my expectations once again, Shalev produced the super-quadratic separation, but not by designing any new quantum algorithm. Instead, he cleverly engineered a Boolean function for which you can use a combination of Grover’s algorithm and the Forrelation algorithm (or any other quantum algorithm that gives a huge speedup for some partial Boolean function—Forrelation is just the maximal example), to get an overall speedup that’s a little more than quadratic, while still keeping your Boolean function total. I’ll let you read Shalev’s short paper for the details, but briefly, it once again uses the Göös et al. / Ambainis et al. trick of defining a Boolean function that equals 1 if and only if the input string contains some hidden substructure, and the hidden substructure also contains a pointer to a “certificate” that lets you quickly verify that the hidden substructure was indeed there. You can use a super-fast algorithm—let’s say, a quantum algorithm designed for partial functions—to find the hidden substructure assuming it’s there. If you don’t find it, you can simply output 0. But if you do find it (or think you found it), then you can use the certificate, together with Grover’s algorithm, to confirm that you weren’t somehow misled, and that the substructure really was there. This checking step ensures that the function remains total.
Are there further separations to be found this way? Almost certainly! Indeed, Shalev, Robin Kothari, and I have already found some more things (as well as different/simpler proofs of known separations), though nothing quite as exciting as the above.
Update (July 1): Ronald de Wolf points out in the comments that this “trust-but-verify” trick, for designing total Boolean functions with unexpectedly low quantum query complexities, was also used in a recent paper by himself and Ambainis (while Ashley Montanaro points out that a similar trick was used even earlier, in a different context, by Le Gall). What’s surprising, you might say, is that it took as long as it did for people to realize how many applications this trick has.
Update (July 2): In conversation with Robin Kothari and Cedric Lin, I realized that Shalev’s superquadratic separation between R and Q, combined with a recent result of Lin and Lin, resolves another open problem that had bothered me since 2001 or so. Given a Boolean function f, define the “projective quantum query complexity,” or P(f), to be the minimum number of queries made by a bounded-error quantum algorithm, in which the answer register gets immediately measured after each query. This is a model of quantum algorithms that’s powerful enough to capture (for example) Simon’s and Shor’s algorithms, but not Grover’s algorithm. Indeed, one might wonder whether there’s any total Boolean function for which P(f) is asymptotically smaller than R(f)—that’s the question I wondered about around 2001, and that I discussed with Elham Kashefi. Now, by using an argument based on the “Vaidman bomb,” Lin and Lin recently proved the fascinating result that P(f)=O(Q(f)2) for all functions f, partial or total. But, combining with Shalev’s result that there exists a total f for which R(f)=Ω(Q(f)2.5), we get that there’s a total f for which R(f)=Ω(P(f)1.25). In the other direction, the best I know is that P(f)=Ω(bs(f)) and therefore R(f)=O(P(f)3).",6591,"['e0da1846c30d29c6ea0995d9479e893d186e95d75b70294035f9e8f6f7df4edb', '249109b59cc363eb1312e4547402bf9c11257833bf178252de397dbbdc24c9dd', '0201da52d03bae076c5f5aadfa6f8dbbf39fc94ff82a78605aa68c296b2dce7f', '2473b82fbd86d2b072b9240154203513be046d3c08c3d3d3b71fdbd99bebd4b3', '4dfda50c4cb18656796181990524adc5084efec688b594e85218cd0322c4a0e3', '5df8308fab9e0e67c9c81c95f07e66e27a54e8ceb451b2bcffe6a98623dfc848', '43db60a7a286e30f2f710ae1c952221194a5fedfee8b12afb9ff7cbef38e7fab', 'd706d315ebb92ca4080e33231c695afd5015c42442be13fb9acc5f4f4495d7d0', 'cb71b35c4e50095ea2bff6a7937f1a216f64bb9eb7ef355cd823b0bfbf2a10c1', 'c86e9ebc34c382dcbf26706dda11161b60f800e8d37a7c8614a70844a8f841d5', '0dad6e35e3a8453b03008a459aa6b096e829dbaeba34352e3a49597ff05605a9', 'ebe44ee4d85e8fcba47ff35948c8600f89e3815ec7c44c44121a6b6dd55d9f8e']"

Lots of people have accused me of overusing the word “breakthrough” on this blog. So I ask them: what word should I use when a paper comes out that solves not one, not two, but three of the open problems I’ve cared about most for literally half of my life, since I was 17 years old?
Yesterday morning, Andris Ambainis, Kaspars Balodis, Aleksandrs Belovs, Troy Lee, Miklos Santha, and Juris Smotrovs posted a preprint to ECCC in which they give:
(1) A total Boolean function f with roughly a fourth-power separation between its deterministic and bounded-error quantum query complexities (i.e., with D(f)~Q(f)4). This refutes the conjecture, which people have been making since Beals et al.’s seminal work in 1998, that the biggest possible gap is quadratic.
(2) A total Boolean function f with a quadratic separation between its deterministic and randomized query complexities (with D(f)~R0(f)2). This refutes a conjecture of Saks and Wigderson from 1986, that the best possible gap is R0(f)~D(f)0.753 (from the recursive AND/OR tree), and shows that the known relation D(f)=O(R0(f)2) is close to tight.
(3) The first total Boolean function f with any asymptotic gap between its zero-error and bounded-error randomized query complexities (in particular, with R0(f)~R(f)3/2).
(There are also other new separations—for example, involving exact quantum query complexity and approximate degree as a real polynomial. But the above three are the most spectacular to me.)
In updates to this post (coming soon), I’ll try my best to explain to general readers what D(f), R(f), and so forth are (see here for the classic survey of these measures), and I’ll also discuss how Ambainis et al. designed the strange functions f that achieve the separations (though their paper already does a good job of explaining it). For now, I’ll just write the stuff that’s easier to write.
I’m at the Federated Computing Research Conference in Portland, Oregon right now, where yesterday I gave my STOC talk (click here for the PowerPoint slides) about the largest possible separations between R(f) and Q(f) for partial Boolean functions f. (That paper is also joint work with Andris Ambainis, who has his fingers in many pies, or his queries in many oracles, or something.) Anyway, when I did a practice run of my talk on Monday night, I commented that, of course, for total Boolean functions f (those not involving a promise), the largest known gap between R(f) and Q(f) is quadratic, and is achieved when f is the OR function because of Grover’s algorithm.
Then, Tuesday morning, an hour before I was to give my talk, I saw the Ambainis et al. bombshell, which made that comment obsolete. So, being notoriously bad at keeping my mouth shut, I mentioned to my audience that, while it was great that they came all the way to Portland to learn what was new in theoretical computer science, if they wanted real news in the subfield I was talking about, they could stop listening to me and check their laptops.
(Having said that, I have had a wonderful time at FCRC, and have learned lots of other interesting things—I can do another addendum to the post about FCRC highlights if people want me to.)
Anyway, within the tiny world of query complexity—i.e., the world where I cut my teeth and spent much of my career—the Ambainis et al. paper is sufficiently revolutionary that I feel the need to say what it doesn’t do.
First, the paper does not give a better-than-quadratic gap between R(f) and Q(f) (i.e., between bounded-error randomized and quantum query complexities). The quantum algorithms that compute their functions f are still “just” variants of the old standbys, Grover’s algorithm and amplitude amplification. What’s new is that the authors have found functions where you can get the quadratic, Grover speedup between R(f) and Q(f), while also getting asymptotic gaps between D(f) and R(f), and between R0(f) and R(f). So, putting it together, you get superquadratic gaps between D(f) and Q(f), and between R0(f) and Q(f). But it remains at least a plausible conjecture that R(f)=O(Q(f)2) for all total Boolean functions f—i.e., if you insist on a “fair comparison,” then the largest known quantum speedup for total Boolean functions remains the Grover one.
Second, as far as I can tell
(I might be mistaken) (I’m not), the paper doesn’t give new separations involving certificate complexity or block sensitivity (e.g., between D(f) and bs(f)). So for example, it remains open whether D(f)=O(bs(f)2), and whether C(f)=O(bs(f)α) for some α<2. (Update: Avishay Tal, in the comments, informs me that the latter conjecture was falsified by Gilmer, Saks, and Srinivasan in 2013. Wow, I’m really out of it!)
In the end, achieving these separations didn’t require any sophisticated new mathematical machinery—just finding the right functions, something that could’ve been done back in 1998, had anyone been clever enough. So, where did these bizarre functions f come from? Ambainis et al. directly adapted them from a great recent communication complexity paper by Mika Göös, Toniann Pitassi, and Thomas Watson. But the Göös et al. paper itself could’ve been written much earlier. It’s yet another example of something I’ve seen again and again in this business, how there’s no substitute for just playing around with a bunch of examples.
The highest compliment one researcher can pay another is, “I wish I’d found that myself.” And I do, of course, but having missed it, I’m thrilled that at least I get to be alive for it and blog about it. Huge congratulations to the authors!
Addendum: What’s this about?
OK, so let’s say you have a Boolean function f:{0,1}n→{0,1}, mapping n input bits to 1 output bit. Some examples are the OR function, which outputs 1 if any of the n input bits are 1, and the MAJORITY function, which outputs 1 if the majority of them are.
Query complexity is the study of how many input bits you need to read in order to learn the value of the output bit. So for example, in evaluating the OR function, if you found a single input bit that was 1, you could stop right there: you’d know that the output was 1, without even needing to look at the remaining bits. In the worst case, however, if the input consisted of all 0s, you’d have to look at all of them before you could be totally sure the output was 0. So we say that the OR function has a deterministic query complexity of n.
In this game, we don’t care about any other resources used by an algorithm, like memory or running time: just how many bits of the input it looks at! There are many reasons why, but the simplest is that, unlike with memory or running time, for many functions we can actually figure out how many input bits need to be looked at, without needing to solve anything like P vs. NP. (But note that this can already be nontrivial! For algorithms can often cleverly avoid looking at all the bits, for example by looking at some and then deciding which ones to look at next based on which values they see.)
In general, given a deterministic algorithm A and an n-bit input string x, let DA,x (an integer from 0 to n) be the number of bits of x that A examines when you run it. Then let DA be the maximum of DA,x over all n-bit strings x. Then D(f), or the deterministic query complexity of f, is the minimum of DA, over all algorithms A that correctly evaluate f(x) on every input x.
For example, D(OR) and D(MAJORITY) are both n: in the worst case, you need to read everything. For a more interesting example, consider the 3-bit Boolean function
f(x,y,z) = (not(x) and y) or (x and z).
This function has D(f)=2, even though it depends on all 3 of the input bits. (Do you see why?) In general, even if f depends on n input bits, D(f) could be as small as log2n.
The bounded-error randomized query complexity, or R(f), is like D(f), except that now we allow the algorithm to make random choices of which input bit to query, and for each input x, the algorithm only needs to compute f(x) with probability 2/3. (Here the choice of 2/3 is arbitrary; if you wanted the right answer with some larger constant probability, say 99.9%, you could just repeat the algorithm a constant number of times and take a majority vote.) The zero-error randomized query complexity, or R0(f), is the variant where the algorithm is allowed to make random choices, but at the end of the day, needs to output the correct f(x) with probability 1.
To illustrate these concepts, consider the three-bit majority function, MAJ(x,y,z). We have D(MAJ)=3, since if a deterministic algorithm queried one bit and got a 0 and queried a second bit and got a 1 (as can happen), it would have no choice but to query the third bit. But for any possible setting of x, y, and z, if we choose which bits to query randomly, there’s at least a 1/3 chance that the first two queries will return either two 0s or two 1s—at which point we can stop, with no need to query the third bit. Hence R0(MAJ)≤(1/3)2+(2/3)3=8/3 (in fact it equals 8/3, although we haven’t quite shown that). Meanwhile, R(MAJ), as we defined it, is only 1, since if you just need a 2/3 probability of being correct, you can simply pick x, y, or z at random and output it!
The bounded-error quantum query complexity, or Q(f), is the minimum number of queries made by a quantum algorithm for f, which, again, has to output the right answer with probability at least 2/3 for every input x. Here a quantum algorithm makes a “query” by feeding a superposition of basis states, each of the form |i,a,w〉, to a “black box,” which maps each basis state to |i, a XOR xi, w〉, where i is the index of the input bit xi to be queried, a is a 1-qubit “answer register” into which xi is reversibly written, and w is a “workspace” that doesn’t participate in the query. In between two queries, the algorithm can apply any unitary transformation it wants to the superposition of |i,a,w〉’s, as long as it doesn’t depend on x. Finally, some designated qubit is measured to decide whether the algorithm accepts or rejects.
As an example, consider the 2-bit XOR function, XOR(x,y). We have D(XOR)=R0(XOR)=R(XOR)=2, since until you’ve queried both bits, you’ve learned nothing about their XOR. By contrast, Q(XOR)=1, because of the famous Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.
It’s clear that
0 ≤ Q(f) ≤ R(f) ≤ R0(f) ≤ D(f) ≤ n,
since a quantum algorithm can simulate a randomized one and a randomized one can simulate a deterministic one.
A central question for the field, since these measures were studied in the 1980s or so, has been how far apart these measures can get from each other. If you allow partial Boolean functions—meaning that only some n-bit strings, not all of them, are “valid inputs” for which the algorithm needs to return a definite answer—then it’s easy to get enormous separations between any two of the measures (indeed, even bigger than exponential), as for example in my recent paper with Andris.
For total functions, by contrast, it’s been known for a long time that these measures can differ by at most polynomial factors:
D(f) = O(R(f)3) (Nisan)
D(f) = O(R0(f)2) (folklore, I think)
R0(f) = O(R2 log(n)) (Midrijanis)
D(f) = O(Q(f)6) (Beals et al. 1998)
OK, so what were the largest known gaps? For D versus R0 (as well as D versus R), the largest known gap since 1986 has come from the “recursive AND/OR tree”: that is, an OR of two ANDs of two ORs of two ANDs of … forming a complete binary tree of depth d, with the n=2d input variables comprising the leaves. For this function, we have D(f)=n, whereas Saks and Wigderson showed that R0(f)=Θ(n0.753) (and later, Santha showed that R(f)=Θ(n0.753) as well).
For D versus Q, the largest gap has been for the OR function: we have D(OR)=n (as mentioned earlier), but Q(OR)=Θ(√n) because of Grover’s algorithm. Finally, for R0 versus R, no asymptotic gap has been known for any total function. (This is a problem that I clearly remember working on back in 2000, when I was an undergrad. I even wrote a computer program, the Boolean Function Wizard, partly to search for separations between R0 versus R. Alas, while I did find one or two functions with separations, I was unable to conclude anything from them about asymptotics.)
So, how did Ambainis et al. achieve bigger gaps for each of these? I’ll try to have an explanation written by the time my flight from Portland to Boston has landed tonight. But if you can’t wait for that, or you prefer it straight from the horse’s mouth, read their paper!
Addendum 2: The Actual Functions
As I mentioned before, the starting point for everything Ambainis et al. do is a certain Boolean function g recently constructed by Göös, Pitassi, and Watson (henceforth GPW), for different purposes than the ones that concern Ambainis et al. We think of the inputs to g as divided into nm “cells,” which are arranged in a rectangular grid with m columns and n rows. Each cell contains a bit that’s either 0 or 1 (its “label), as well as a pointer to another cell (consisting of ~log2(nm) bits). The pointer can also be “null” (i.e., can point nowhere). We’ll imagine that a query of a cell gives you everything: the label and all the bits of the pointer. This could increase the query complexity of an algorithm, but only by a log(n) factor, which we won’t worry about.
Let X be a setting of all the labels and pointers in the grid. Then the question we ask about X is the following:
- Does there exist a “marked column”: that is, a column where all n of the labels are 1, and which has exactly one non-null pointer, which begins a chain of pointers of length m-1, which visits exactly one “0” cell in each column other than the marked column, and then terminates at a null pointer?
If such a marked column exists, then we set g(X)=1; otherwise we set g(X)=0. Crucially, notice that if a marked column exists, then it’s unique, since the chain of pointers “zeroes out” all m-1 of the other columns, and prevents them from being marked.
This g already leads to a new query complexity separation, one that refutes a strengthened form of the Saks-Wigderson conjecture. For it’s not hard to see that D(g)=Ω(mn): indeed, any deterministic algorithm must query almost all of the cells. A variant of this is proved in the paper, but the basic idea is that an adversary can answer all queries with giant fields of ‘1’ labels and null pointers—until a given column is almost completed, at which point the adversary fills in the last cell with a ‘0’ label and a pointer to the last ‘0’ cell that it filled in. The algorithm just can’t catch a break; it will need to fill in m-1 columns before it knows where the marked one is (if a marked column exists at all).
By contrast, it’s possible to show that, if n=m, then R(g) is about O(n4/3). I had an argument for R(g)=O((n+m)log(m)) in an earlier version of this post, but the argument was wrong; I thank Alexander Belov for catching the error. I’ll post the R(g)=O(n4/3) argument once I understand it.
To get the other separations—for example, total Boolean functions for which D~R02, D~Q4, R0~Q3, R0~R3/2, and R~approxdeg4—Ambainis et al. need to add various “enhancements” to the basic GPW function g defined above. There are three enhancements, which can either be added individually or combined, depending on one’s needs.
1. Instead of just a single marked column, we can define g(X) to be 1 if and only if there are k marked columns, which point to each other in a cycle, and which also point to a trail of m-k ‘0’ cells, showing that none of the other columns contain all ‘1’ cells. This can help a bounded-error randomized algorithm—which can quickly find one of the all-1 columns using random sampling—while not much helping a zero-error randomized algorithm.
2. Instead of a linear chain of pointers showing that all the non-marked columns contain a ‘0’ cell, for g(X) to be 1 we can demand a complete binary tree of pointers, originating at a marked column and fanning out to all the unmarked columns in only log(m) layers. This can substantially help a quantum algorithm, which can’t follow a pointer trail any faster than a classical algorithm can; but which, given a complete binary tree, can “fan out” and run Grover’s algorithm on all the leaves in only the square root of the number of queries that would be needed classically. Meanwhile, however, putting the pointers in a tree doesn’t much help deterministic or randomized algorithms.
3. In addition to pointers “fanning out” from a marked column to all of the unmarked columns, we can demand that in every unmarked column, some ‘0’ cell contains a back-pointer, which leads back to a marked column. These back-pointers can help a randomized or quantum algorithm find a marked column faster, while not much helping a deterministic algorithm.
Unless I’m mistaken, the situation is this:
With no enhancements, you can get D~R2 and something like D~R03/2 (
although I still don’t understand how you get the latter with no enhancements; the paper mentions it without proof Andris has kindly supplied a proof here).
With only the cycle enhancement, you can get R0~R3/2.
With only the binary tree enhancement, you can get R~approxdeg4.
With only the back-pointer enhancement, you can get D~R02.
With the cycle enhancement and the binary-tree enhancement, you can get R0~Q3.
With the back-pointer enhancement and the binary-tree enhancement, you can get D~Q4.
It’s an interesting question whether there are separations that require both the cycle enhancement and the back-pointer enhancement; Ambainis et al. don’t give any examples.
And here’s another interesting question not mentioned in the paper. Using the binary-tree enhancement, Ambainis et al. achieve a fourth-power separation between bounded-error randomized query complexity and approximate degree as a real polynomial—i.e., quadratically better than any separation that was known before. Their proof of this involves cleverly constructing a low-degree polynomial by summing a bunch of low-degree polynomials derived from quantum algorithms (one for each possible marked row). As a result, their final, summed polynomial does not itself correspond to a quantum algorithm, meaning that they don’t get a fourth-power separation between R and Q (which would’ve been even more spectacular than what they do get). On the other hand, purely from the existence of a function with R~approxdeg4, we can deduce that that function has either
(i) a super-quadratic gap between R and Q (refuting my conjecture that the Grover speedup is the best possible quantum speedup for total Boolean functions), or
(ii) a quadratic gap between quantum query complexity and approximate degree—substantially improving over the gap found by Ambainis in 2003.
I conjecture that the truth is (ii); it would be great to have a proof or disproof of this.",18992,"['9b3ec980a5157278085c64cc2d87d8a0f54b51baf209c4d14026df5b33aad3c1', '813abc4d4e4116ac4dd807beddfbf49b10cc2323721ff040f87e39e6f03352ec', '7a293a520e600f14dcb36a1ed07c95bd667a980c5af69162daa81198927a5af2', 'b8d0564d235414aa131d99532bc97c9b7d822c7149055fa784353ac4b89b81a3', '9c897544b81c68e51e3a5fe085e5d68be3d34a47cd540d7d025fd75ef779b76e', '3e49f789a4393052c44f00b716372287d88aca332d92b3cc7f224f30fb417393', 'e608471d4da36601353352cacccd189a73d8ab517424cf51763289198f34686b', '80d4fd1175fbdc26bec01580c5646f1aa58b3ddbdb04a9123cbd96e4b97f6d8d', '892a796adfba31143263f5f6436d39ba0f6de60b0991b870bf54a176b5f2a9ff', '44ea645938f8c45d04d3b5e27f5eefb170e2d392e88ba46af4c54b3551a31a76', 'fe98e8ce93237a376e71de1d99fb3ff6806d70ae2f0644cb52fe089551aad8e4', '1fa6563c0538e7cdbc690ec09388d186f3a32ca20b40614a474b5097075f4167', '3cc0ce3c53f98485afbc43594bef08468ba183f6a7bc9aa202b3e37e4f8c4025', '668172ac9aa85f10133f89d35c1003adbbdada19f6d713ecf709ac304a7e65c0', '657f054b964dc55cff7332452aaba7ba73dda69a37f75993bf9865f581281b7f', 'ec6619a286474a789ef81f95e3c739256b82d6d4d547c462d12dd3a213b48f8a', 'a97b06fa89822a8a30489db4f767845128552608f74b2cec2c436b2b8f6aa01f', '15d2358411074b00a40b44648e06c29e58a4c0a43c3bb8e1a9b74373cfd44b61', '95a3fe3b093486592788ba4798a437da67e4da414403d2f9673badd6a4c8f4cb', 'a896f173636d785c03d035965692cf9a8df18fa28ca6649104768ebe63ce42df', 'fadd685018c99d89b610000a6d630b46086af4002ea20cd33bb97f4255e612f0', '6059f133385658035f1cdbff5218ebba65f55afff0983d3a11a6dfd05b25a73b', '173530ea2d7a2d7e1868d972b46448dbfe9e9cb5172539276874404f98cf9f38', '2797c93cec537d043117093d5e4d72f1b0218d5d41938214b4ba20fd76db7d53', '56f8262de489a34e76fa6320365f7a659741e60aebdd78550f7fd97fed7b8af9']"

152,2155,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2155,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2015-01-12,Scott Aaronson,Quantum computing news items (by reader request),"Within the last couple months, there was a major milestone in the quest to build a scalable quantum computer, and also a major milestone in the quest to figure out what you would do with a quantum computer if you had one. As I’ve admitted many times, neither of those two quests is really the reason why I got into quantum computing—I’m one of the people who would still want to study this field, even if there were no serious prospect either of building a quantum computer or of doing anything useful with it for a thousand years—but for some reason that I don’t fully understand, both of those goals do seem to excite other people.
So, OK, the experimental breakthrough was the Martinis group’s use of quantum error-correction with superconducting qubits, to preserve a logical bit for several times longer than the underlying physical qubits survived for. Shortly before this came out, I heard Krysta Svore give a talk at Yale in which she argued that preserving a logical qubit for longer than the physical qubits was the next experimental milestone (the fourth, out of seven she listed) along the way to a scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computer. Well,
it looks like that milestone may have been crossed. (update: I’ve since learned from Graeme Smith, in the comments section, that the milestone crossed should really be considered the “3.5th,” since even though quantum error-correction was used, the information that was being protected was classical. I also learned from commenter Jacob that the seven milestones Krysta listed came from a Science paper by Schoelkopf and Devorret. She cited the paper; the forgetfulness was entirely mine.)
In more detail, the Martinis group used a linear array of 9 qubits: 5 data qubits interleaved with 4 measurement qubits. The authors describe this setup as a “precursor” to Kitaev’s surface code (which would involve a 2-dimensional array). They report that, after 8 cycles of error detection and correction, they were able to suppress the effective error rate compared to the physical qubits by a factor of 8.5. They also use quantum state tomography to verify that their qubits were indeed in entangled states as they did this.
Of course, this is not yet a demonstration of any nontrivial fault-tolerant computation, let alone of scaling such a computation up to where it’s hard to simulate with a classical computer. But it pretty clearly lies along the “critical path” to that.
As I blogged back in September, Google recently hired Martinis’s group away from UC Santa Barbara, where they’ll work on superconducting quantum annealing, as a step along the way to full universal QC. As I mentioned then, the Martinis group’s “Xmon” qubits have maybe 10,000 times the coherence times of D-Wave’s qubits, at least when you measure coherence in the usual ways. The fact that Martinis et al. are carefully doing quantum state tomography and demonstrating beneficial error-correction before scaling up are further indications of the differences between their approach and D-Wave’s. Of course, even if you do everything right, there’s still no guarantee that you’ll outperform a classical computer anytime soon: it might simply be that the things you can do in the near future (e.g., quantum annealing for NP-complete problems) are not things where you’re going to outperform the best classical algorithms. But it’s certainly worth watching closely.
Meanwhile, the quantum algorithms breakthrough came in a paper last month by an extremely well-known trio down the Infinite Corridor from me: Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann. In slightly earlier work, Farhi et al. proposed a new quantum algorithm for NP-hard optimization problems. Their algorithm badly needs a name; right now they’re just calling it the “QAOA,” or Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. But here’s what you need to know: their new algorithm is different from their famous adiabatic algorithm, although it does become equivalent to the adiabatic algorithm in a certain infinite limit. Rather than staying in the ground state of some Hamiltonian, the QAOA simply
- starts with a uniform superposition over all n-bit strings,
- applies a set of unitary transformations, one for each variable and constraint of the NP-hard instance,
- repeats the set some number of times p (the case p=1 is already interesting), and then
- measures the state in the computational basis to see what solution was obtained.
The unitary transformations have adjustable real parameters, and a big part of the game is figuring out how to set the parameters to get a good solution.
The original, hyper-ambitious goal of the QAOA was to solve the Unique Games problem in quantum polynomial time—thereby disproving the Unique Games Conjecture (which I previously blogged about here), unless NP⊆BQP. It hasn’t yet succeeded at that goal. In their earlier work, Farhi et al. managed to show that the QAOA solves the MAX-CUT problem on 3-regular graphs with approximation ratio 0.6924, which is better than random guessing, but not as good as the best-known classical algorithms (Goemans-Williamson, or for the degree-3 case, Halperin-Livnat-Zwick), let alone better than those algorithms (which is what would be needed to refute the UGC).
In their new work, Farhi et al. apply the QAOA to a different problem: the poetically-named MAX E3LIN2. Here you’re given a collection of linear equations mod 2 in n Boolean variables, where each equation involves exactly 3 variables, and each variable appears in at most D equations. The goal is to satisfy as many of the equations as possible, assuming that they’re not all satisfiable (if they were then the problem would be trivial). If you just guess a solution randomly, you’ll satisfy a 1/2 fraction of the equations. Håstad gave a polynomial-time classical algorithm that satisfies a 1/2+c/D fraction of the maximum number of satisfiable equations, for some constant c. This remains the best approximation ratio that we know how to achieve classically. Meanwhile, Trevisan showed that if there’s a polynomial-time classical algorithm that satisfies a 1/2+c/√D fraction of the max number of satisfiable equations, for a sufficiently large constant c, then P=NP.
OK, so what do Farhi et al. do? They show that the QAOA, with suitably tuned parameters, is able to satisfy a 1/2+c/D3/4 fraction of the total number of equations in polynomial time, for some constant c. (In particular, this implies that a 1/2+c/D3/4 fraction of the equations are satisfiable—assuming, as Farhi et al. do, that two equations directly contradicting each other, like x+y+z=0 and x+y+z=1, never appear in the same instance.)
Now, the above is a bigger fraction than the best-known classical algorithm satisfies! (And not only that, but here the fraction is of the total number of equations, rather than the number of satisfiable equations.) Farhi et al. also show that, if the constraint hypergraph doesn’t contain any small cycles, then QAOA can satisfy a 1/2+c/√D fraction of the equations in polynomial time, which is essentially the best possible unless NP⊆BQP.
The importance of this result is not that anyone cares about the MAX E3LIN2 problem for its own sake. Rather it’s that, as far as I know, this is the first time that a quantum algorithm has been proved to achieve a better approximation ratio for a natural NP-hard optimization problem than the best known classical algorithm achieves. People have discussed that as a hypothetical possibility for 20 years, but (again, unless I’m missing something) we never had a good example until now. The big question now is whether the 1/2+c/D3/4 performance can be matched classically, or whether there truly is an NP-intermediate region of this optimization problem where quantum outperforms classical. (The third possibility, that doing as well as the quantum algorithm is already NP-hard, is one that I won’t even speculate about. For, as Boaz Barak rightly points out in the comments section, the quantum algorithm is still being analyzed only in the regime where solutions are combinatorially guaranteed to exist—and that regime can’t possibly be NP-hard, unless NP=coNP.)
[Above, I corrected some errors that appeared in the original version of this post—thanks to Ed Farhi and to the commenters for bringing them to my attention.]
Update (Feb. 3, 2015): Boaz Barak has left the following comment:

This year Quanta Claus has brought us eight fascinating final project reports from students in my 6.845 Quantum Complexity Theory class, covering everything from interactive proofs to query and communication complexity to quantum algorithms to quantum gates (and one project even includes a web-based demo you can try!). Continuing in the tradition of the two previous showcases, I’m sharing the reports here; some of these works might also be posted to the arXiv and/or submitted to journals. Thanks so much to the students who volunteered to participate in the showcase, and to all the students for making this such a great class.
- On Applications of the Equilibrium Value Method, by Serena Booth. A survey about Xiaodi Wu’s simpler alternative approach to proving QIP=PSPACE, and whether it might also yield a proof of QRG=RG=EXP.
- Improved Quantum Query Complexity Bounds for Some Graph Problems, by Prafulla Dhariwal and Vinay Mayar. Building on Lin and Lin’s striking recent work on “Vaidman-bomb query complexity,” obtains some new results about the quantum query complexity of k-source shortest paths and minimum vertex cover in bipartite graphs.
- On Quantum Sieve Approaches to the Lattice Shortest Vector Problem, by Daniel Epelbaum. Surveys Greg Kuperberg’s subexponential-time quantum algorithm for the dihedral Hidden Subgroup Problem, as well as Oded Regev’s reduction of the approximate shortest vector problem to dihedral HSP. Discusses in detail why these two things, combined, do not yield a quantum algorithm for lattice problems that outperforms the best known classical algorithms.
- Approximate Degree of AND-OR Trees, by Pritish Kamath and Prashant Vasudevan. Discusses the wonderful open problem of proving that every AND-OR tree with N leaves, even a highly-unbalanced one, has approximate degree Ω(√N) as a real polynomial. (We know from Reichardt’s seminal work on quantum query complexity that the degree is O(√N).) Makes some partial progress on this conjecture—e.g., resolves it up to a polylog(N) factor for trees of constant depth.
- Infinite Separation of Quantum Information and Communication, by Dax Koh and Zi-Wen Liu. Wrings a further implication out of the striking recent work of Perry, Jain, and Oppenheim, about a communication task with infinite quantum/classical separation (“infinite” meaning that one of them is O(1)—o(1) actually—and the other is Ω(N)).
- Taming Quantum Amplitudes with Gateset Limitations, by Ross Rheingans-Yoo. Surveys the issue of doubly-exponentially small probabilities for PostBQP circuits, which I covered recently on this blog as well as on MathOverflow. Takes an initial step toward resolving the problem of whether π and e are “tame” numbers, by using the concept of irrationality coefficients to show that a constant number of gates with π- and e-like amplitudes can be tolerated in a PostBQP circuit.
- Tools for Quantum Circuit Synthesis, by Chelsea Voss. Click here to try Chelsea’s software! Discusses the creation of a web-based tool that lets you experiment with synthesizing quantum circuits and observing their behavior, and also gives you quantum-circuit-synthesis puzzles to solve.
- Complexity of the Quantum Separability Problem and Its Variants, by Charles Xu.

154,2072,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2072,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2014-12-01,Scott Aaronson,PostBQP Postscripts: A Confession of Mathematical Errors,"tl;dr: This post reveals two errors in one of my most-cited papers, and also explains how to fix them. Thanks to Piotr Achinger, Michael Cohen, Greg Kuperberg, Ciaran Lee, Ryan O’Donnell, Julian Rosen, Will Sawin, Cem Say, and others for their contributions to this post.
If you look at my Wikipedia page, apparently one of the two things in the world that I’m “known for” (along with algebrization) is “quantum Turing with postselection.” By this, Wikipedia means my 2004 definition of the complexity class PostBQP—that is, the class of decision problems solvable in bounded-error quantum polynomial time, assuming the ability to postselect (or condition) on certain measurement outcomes—and my proof that PostBQP coincides with the classical complexity PP (that is, the class of decision problems expressible in terms of whether the number of inputs that cause a given polynomial-time Turing machine to accept does or doesn’t exceed some threshold).
To explain this a bit: even without quantum mechanics, it’s pretty obvious that, if you could “postselect” on exponentially-unlikely events, then you’d get huge, unrealistic amounts of computational power. For example (and apologies in advance for the macabre imagery), you could “solve” NP-complete problems in polynomial time by simply guessing a random solution, then checking whether the solution is right, and shooting yourself if it happened to be wrong! Conditioned on still being alive (and if you like, appealing to the “anthropic principle”), you must find yourself having guessed a valid solution—assuming, of course, that there were any valid solutions to be found. If there weren’t any, then you’d seem to be out of luck! (Exercise for the reader: generalize this “algorithm,” so that it still works even if you don’t know in advance whether your NP-complete problem instance has any valid solutions.)
So with the PostBQP=PP theorem, the surprise was not that postselection gives you lots of computational power, but rather that postselection combined with quantum mechanics gives you much more power even than postselection by itself (or quantum mechanics by itself, for that matter). Since PPP=P#P, the class PP basically captures the full difficulty of #P-complete counting problems—that is, not just solving an NP-complete problem, but counting how many solutions it has. It’s not obvious that a quantum computer with postselection can solve counting problems, but that’s what the theorem shows. That, in turn, has implications for other things: for example, I showed it can be used to prove classical facts about PP, like the fact that PP is closed under intersection (the Beigel-Reingold-Spielman Theorem), in a straightforward way; and it’s also used to show the hardness of quantum sampling problems, in the work of Bremner-Jozsa-Shepherd as well as my BosonSampling work with Arkhipov.
I’m diffident about being “known for” something so simple; once I had asked the question, the proof of PostBQP=PP took me all of an hour to work out. Yet PostBQP ended up being a hundred times more influential for quantum computing theory than things on which I expended a thousand times more effort. So on balance, I guess I’m happy to call PostBQP my own.
That’s why today’s post comes with a special sense of intellectual responsibility. Within the last month, it’s come to my attention that there are at least two embarrassing oversights in my PostBQP paper from a decade ago, one of them concerning the very definition of PostBQP. I hasten to clarify: once one fixes up the definition, the PostBQP=PP theorem remains perfectly valid, and all the applications of PostBQP that I mentioned above—for example, to reproving Beigel-Reingold-Spielman, and to the hardness of quantum sampling problems—go through just fine. But if you think I have nothing to be embarrassed about: well, read on.
The definitional subtlety came clearly to my attention a few weeks ago, when I was lecturing about PostBQP in my 6.845 Quantum Complexity Theory graduate class. I defined PostBQP as the class of languages L⊆{0,1}* for which there exists a polynomial-time quantum Turing machine M such that, for all inputs x∈{0,1}*,
- M(x) “succeeds” (determined, say, by measuring its first output qubit in the {|0>,|1>} basis) with nonzero probability.
- If x∈L, then conditioned on M(x) succeeding, M(x) “accepts” (determined, say, by measuring its second output qubit in the {|0>,|1>} basis) with probability at least 2/3.
- If x∉L, then conditioned on M(x) succeeding, M(x) accepts with probability at most 1/3.
I then had to reassure the students that PostBQP, so defined, was a “robust” class: that is, that the definition doesn’t depend on stupid things like which set of quantum gates we allow. I argued that, even though we’re postselecting on exponentially-unlikely events, it’s still OK, because the Solovay-Kitaev Theorem lets us approximate any desired unitary to within exponentially-small error, with only a polynomial increase in the size of our quantum circuit. (Here we actually need the full power of the Solovay-Kitaev Theorem, in contrast to ordinary BQP, where we only need part of the power.)
A student in the class, Michael Cohen, immediately jumped in with a difficulty: what if M(x) succeeded, not with exponentially-small probability, but with doubly-exponentially-small probability—say, exp(-2n)? In that case, one could no longer use the Solovay-Kitaev Theorem to show the irrelevance of the gate set. It would no longer even be clear that PostBQP⊆PP, since the PP simulation might not be able to keep track of such tiny probabilities.
Thinking on my feet, I replied that we could presumably choose a set of gates—for example, gates involving rational numbers only—for which doubly-exponentially-small probabilities would never arise. Or if all else failed, we could simply add to the definition of PostBQP that M(x) had to “succeed” with probability at least 1/exp(n): after all, that was the only situation I ever cared about anyway, and the only one that ever arose in the applications of PostBQP.
But the question still gnawed at me: was there a problem with my original, unamended definition of PostBQP? If we weren’t careful in choosing our gate set, could we have cancellations that produced doubly-exponentially-small probabilities? I promised I’d think about it more.
By a funny coincidence, just a couple weeks later, Ciaran Lee, a student at Oxford, emailed me the exact same question. So on a train ride from Princeton to Boston, I decided to think about it for real. It wasn’t hard to show that, if the gates involved square roots of rational numbers only—for example, if we’re dealing with the Hadamard and Toffoli gates, or the cos(π/8) and CNOT gates, or other standard gate sets—then every measurement outcome has at least 1/exp(n) probability, so there’s no problem with the definition of PostBQP. But I didn’t know what might happen with stranger gate sets.
As is my wont these days—when parenting, teaching, and so forth leave me with almost no time to concentrate on math—I posted the problem to MathOverflow. Almost immediately, I got incisive responses. First, Piotr Achinger pointed out that, if we allow arbitrary gates, then it’s easy to get massive cancellations. In more detail, let {an} be extremely-rapidly growing sequence of integers, say with an+1 > exp(an). Then define
$$ \alpha = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 0.1^{a_n}. $$
If we write out α in decimal notation, it will consist of mostly 0’s, but with 1’s spaced further and further apart, like so: 0.1101000000000001000…. Now consider a gate set that involves α as well as 0.1 and -0.1 as matrix entries. Given n qubits, it’s not hard to see that we can set up an interference experiment in which one of the paths leading to a given outcome E has amplitude α, and the other paths have amplitudes $$ -(0.1^{a_1}), -(0.1^{a_2}), \ldots, -(0.1^{a_k}), $$ where k is the largest integer such that ak≤n. In that case, the total amplitude of E will be about $$0.1^{a_{k+1}},$$ which for most values of n is doubly-exponentially small in n. Of course, by simply choosing a faster-growing sequence {an}, we can cause an even more severe cancellation.
Furthermore, by modifying the above construction to involve two crazy transcendental numbers α and β, I claim that we can set up a PostBQP computation such that deciding what happens is arbitrarily harder than PP (though still computable)—say, outside of exponential space, or even triple-exponential space. Moreover, we can do this despite the fact that the first n digits of α and β remain computable in O(n) time. The details are left as an exercise for the interested reader.
Yet even though we can engineer massive cancellations with crazy gates, I still conjectured that nothing would go wrong with “normal” gates: for example, gates involving algebraic amplitudes only. More formally, I conjectured that any finite set A=(a1,…,ak) of algebraic numbers is “tame,” in the sense that, if p is any degree-n polynomial with integer coefficients at most exp(n) in absolute value, then p(a1,…,ak)≠0 implies |p(a1,…,ak)|≥1/exp(n). And indeed, Julian Rosen on MathOverflow found an elegant proof of this fact. I’ll let you read it over there if you’re interested, but briefly, it interprets the amplitude we want as one particular Archimedean valuation of a certain element of a number field, and then lower-bounds the amplitude by considering the product of all Archimedean and non-Archimedean valuations (the latter of which involves the p-adic numbers). Since this was a bit heavy-duty for me, I was grateful when Will Sawin reformulated the proof in linear-algebraic terms that I understood.
And then came the embarrassing part. A few days ago, I was chatting with Greg Kuperberg, the renowned mathematician and author of our climate-change parable. I thought he’d be interested in this PostBQP progress, so I mentioned it to him. Delicately, Greg let me know that he had recently proved the exact same results, for the exact same reason (namely, fixing the definition of PostBQP), for the latest revision of his paper How Hard Is It to Approximate the Jones Polynomial?. Moreover, he actually wrote to me in June to tell me about this! At the time, however, I regarded it as “pointless mathematical hairsplitting” (who cares about these low-level gate-set issues anyway?). So I didn’t pay it any attention—and then I’d completely forgotten about Greg’s work when the question resurfaced a few months later. This is truly a just punishment for looking down on “mathematical hairsplitting,” and not a lesson I’ll soon forget.
Anyway, Greg’s paper provides yet a third proof that the algebraic numbers are tame, this one using Galois conjugates (though it turns out that, from a sufficiently refined perspective, Greg’s proof is equivalent to the other two).
There remains one obvious open problem here, one that I noted in the MathOverflow post and in which Greg is also extremely interested. Namely, we now know that it’s possible to screw up PostBQP using gates with amplitudes that are crazy transcendental numbers (closely related to the Liouville numbers). And we also know that, if the gates have algebraic amplitudes, then everything is fine: all events have at least 1/exp(n) probability. But what if the gates have not-so-crazy transcendental amplitudes, like 1/e, or (a bit more realistically) cos(2)? I conjecture that everything is still fine, but the proof techniques that worked for the algebraic case seem useless here.
Stepping back, how great are the consequences of all this for our understanding of PostBQP? Fortunately, I claim that they’re not that great, for the following reason. As Adleman, DeMarrais, and Huang already noted in 1997—in the same paper that proved BQP⊆PP—we can screw up the definition even of BQP, let alone PostBQP, using a bizarre enough gate set. For example, suppose we had a gate G that mapped |0> to x|0>+y|1>, where y was a real number whose binary expansion encoded the halting problem (for example, y might equal Chaitin’s Ω). Then by applying G more and more times, we could learn more and more bits of y, and thereby solve an uncomputable problem in the limit n→∞.
Faced with this observation, most quantum computing experts would say something like: “OK, but this is silly! It has no physical relevance, since we’ll never come across a magical gate like G—if only we did! And at any rate, it has nothing to do with quantum computing specifically: even classically, one could imagine a coin that landed heads with probability equal to Chaitin’s Ω. Therefore, the right way to deal with this is simply to define BQP in such a way as to disallow such absurd gates.” And indeed, that is what’s done today—usually without even remarking on it.
Now, it turns out that even gates that are “perfectly safe” for defining BQP, can turn “unsafe” when it comes to defining PostBQP. To screw up the definition of PostBQP, it’s not necessary that a gate involve uncomputable (or extremely hard-to-compute) amplitudes: the amplitudes could all be easily computable, but they could still be “unsafe” because of massive cancellations, as in the example above involving α. But one could think of this as a difference of degree, rather than of kind. It’s still true that there’s a large set of gates, including virtually all the gates anyone has ever cared about in practice (Toffoli, Hadamard, π/8, etc. etc.), that are perfectly safe for defining the complexity class; it’s just that the set is slightly smaller than it was for BQP.
The other issue with the PostBQP=PP paper was discovered by Ryan O’Donnell and Cem Say. In Proposition 3 of the paper, I claim that PostBQP = BQPPostBQP||,classical, where the latter is the class of problems solvable by a BQP machine that’s allowed to make poly(n) parallel, classical queries to a PostBQP oracle. As Ryan pointed out to me, nothing in my brief argument for this depended on quantum mechanics, so it would equally well show that PostBPP = BPPPostBPP||, where PostBPP (also known as BPPpath) is the classical analogue of PostBQP, and BPPPostBPP|| is the class of problems solvable by a BPP machine that can make poly(n) parallel queries to a PostBPP oracle. But BPPPostBPP|| clearly contains BPPNP||, which in turn contains AM—so we would get AM in PostBPP, and therefore AM in PostBQP=PP. But Vereshchagin gave an oracle relative to which AM is not contained in PP. Since there was no nonrelativizing ingredient anywhere in my argument, the only possible conclusion is that my argument was wrong. (This, incidentally, provides a nice illustration of the value of oracle results.)
In retrospect, it’s easy to pinpoint what went wrong. If we try to simulate BPPPostBPP|| in PostBPP, our random bits will be playing a dual role: in choosing the queries to be submitted to the PostBPP oracle, and in providing the “raw material for postselection,” in computing the responses to those queries. But in PostBPP, we only get to postselect once. When we do, the two sets of random bits that we’d wanted to keep separate will get hopelessly mixed up, with the postselection acting on the “BPP” random bits, not just on the “PostBPP” ones.
How can we fix this problem? Well, when defining the class BQPPostBQP||,classical, suppose we require the queries to the PostBQP oracle to be not only “classical,” but deterministic: that is, they have to be generated in advance by a P machine, and can’t depend on any random bits whatsoever. And suppose we define BPPPostBPP||,classical similarly. In that case, it’s not hard to see that the equalities BQPPostBQP||,classical = PostBQP and BPPPostBPP||,classical = PostBPP both go through. You don’t actually care about this, do you? But Ryan O’Donnell and Cem Say did, and that’s good enough for me.
I wish I could say that these are the only cases of mistakes recently being found in decade-old papers of mine, but alas, such is not the case. In the near future, my student Adam Bouland, MIT undergrad Mitchell Lee, and Singapore’s Joe Fitzsimons will post to the arXiv a paper that grew out of an error in my 2005 paper Quantum Computing and Hidden Variables. In that paper, I introduced a hypothetical generalization of the quantum computing model, in which one gets to see the entire trajectory of a hidden variable, rather than just a single measurement outcome. I showed that this generalization would let us solve problems somewhat beyond what we think we can do with a “standard” quantum computer. In particular, we could solve the collision problem in O(1) queries, efficiently solve Graph Isomorphism (and all other problems in the Statistical Zero-Knowledge class), and search an N-element list in only ~N1/3 steps, rather than the ~N1/2 steps of Grover’s search algorithm. That part of the paper remains fine!
On the other hand, at the end of the paper, I also gave a brief argument to show that, even in the hidden-variable model, ~N1/3 steps are required to search an N-element list. But Mitchell Lee and Adam Bouland discovered that that argument is wrong: it fails to account for all the possible ways that an algorithm could exploit the correlations between the hidden variable’s values at different moments in time. (I’ve previously discussed this error in other blog posts, as well as in the latest edition of Quantum Computing Since Democritus.)
If we suitably restrict the hidden-variable theory, then we can correctly prove a lower bound of ~N1/4, or even (with strong enough assumptions) ~N1/3; and we do that in the forthcoming paper. Even with no restrictions, as far as we know an ~N1/3 lower bound for search with hidden variables remains true. But it now looks like proving it will require a major advance in our understanding of hidden-variable theories: for example, a proof that the “Schrödinger theory” is robust to small perturbations, which I’d given as the main open problem in my 2005 paper.
As if that weren’t enough, in my 2003 paper Quantum Certificate Complexity, I claimed (as a side remark) that one could get a recursive Boolean function f with an asymptotic gap between the block sensitivity bs(f) and the randomized certificate complexity RC(f). However, two and a half years ago, Avishay Tal discovered that this didn’t work, because block sensitivity doesn’t behave nicely under composition. (In assuming it did, I was propagating an error introduced earlier by Wegener and Zádori.) More broadly, Avishay showed that there is no recursively-defined Boolean function with an asymptotic gap between bs(f) and RC(f). On the other hand, if we just want some Boolean function with an asymptotic gap between bs(f) and RC(f), then Raghav Kulkarni observed that we can use a non-recursive function introduced by Xiaoming Sun, which yields bs(f)≈N3/7 and RC(f)≈N4/7. This is actually a larger separation than the one I’d wrongly claimed.
Now that I’ve come clean about all these things, hopefully the healing can begin at last.",18969,"['f6018655b00881fa0caf8ea85292f89f892cd01ba0e097595bb0462899cf1bee', '64b2b06aca314e02f652e982e6793995930f258d9b99bebba27e89a0d2a321a1', 'cfd171d83be157e32972394ef0682d981ca3972564ba54e3ad8dca6c82ab03a7', '36c5515306afd1fdf7598585cbc94ea5dbfe3e031a6bdf17d6ef24c73dd792c3', '9faf35b9b86694d26849beef5027ba8ecec0b2ccc80523e29175c8a978433c19', '492bd2ab0c9019e51b594777df1b3b2a0ce3a615108a524876ace1a92d1330ed', 'd605de88ff78d1927d3d1f8a6f2616126806dfc6195260b22ea49d00ce9c4abe', 'e53421d96bfb9555594b732b74068f2ed67f728d4a0886b8805234142b44e10d', '93b01020a74c73df8600733b852bcd4f1903e9405181fa5067fa5f7ce486eda6', 'b7a17c13b2f18e5728be9dd7bffcee2ba2f258250d230b4889db27f659c1439d', '9ca15832f121d656af4270e6da46f030cf831d3d20e2a2b16530403f622c6537', 'e439f18164ffb4ec92f67fc642f4c213ae6f52002891d40ca7f7f954469d37b0', '05eaee10b7a64295c56dc07f98b60e70dfd48607c73cacdcc541e4887d4d86b4', '37647f69307cdb2b3caca6efbb81db80d2fefae0d262ed16bdbfafe05d2054dd', '975188ee95e0bbfa2f100b19c438000748b1a8569227ea3a0b8bbaa9bc4213c0', '7b081839f2d1e4b87cdf11ffe3b9669547d571fe29929b5da7ed25e2205c3802', '873a6cc7537937d3bfad2bc1c8752f714ab9adada0819b0830d7c7d0bbe40b46', '085ac368d45dd67939de5049deaf2c8c3e2d412bb10c21eb282915b0e9207d23', '0a942baec3172786523ea6674a39f6274765b81904f9bb11e0ee1602dfff3e76', '557a9a8427ca1686a199bff2bfb360b182a036d50709e67e1785bd31e9f2744f', 'ca1d794ee93e7617667db8ed20ea51ccbc5c82912b238c3cf2bc34df530f6744', '75330fc064ac9a43f823123a321115251d20d31d5baf2faef21bae893993f389', 'b4da98a58fcaa61e1ec13b4c568b9c1a2215385c0375c0660968e4956fe37a90', '020eb50d727d39bd69a469a02b75c050f98397e381fba8dd7e68aa3e7553bc1e', '05ee4936a1dfb7bc3ef908742a6669ab9d3c67788069406702444e3346fa0a57', 'b7004a3538c1bbd7a31d4aa489c03ab6fd519d1f37d9d797261df815f139074b', 'c376c4d6cfe18dd15bae19cfc2bf226e18e30e9a9d6b3d2e24e29d5f6ec68cf1', 'a628ef0aac6e86e79669af3e215288fad4ca344214d650123f4331d473366305', '34cb63f0d1eaf99f3d4e570c209e6e4df55f68c4926bdc1accfa57536cea0ff2', '192d8830eaeb8e6541f125f7e82856d2d7ddf74da55be4118453fa0c664e96c4', '58d676087234a981d7343447e4adfbb8231d12f5780ab48270eef4056d25521b', '652d28cc84431a7eea9b6e8124ee0ad708d93857c3352bbfc364aa93f043bd93', '9ead30b9fda695d9aeb537a742530e2f431eb860eacf325da0d8e9fe84f267f1', '7c1d55ec10fad4dc6a54149fab3d132327ceeb75676733a1a87446672fb30ef1', 'ef213eef916d10926df362c0dbf7114d09cfd3b4b7b1475544194de6e1280816', '73e00077472f788989c529156083f4daaa70497020797815d04928ede4560fce', 'cb2b2fba864080dd529e606bc924b74cbe0e626ca80cee2a8a037bf6e3a2858d', '3c9c95e6411c77f046fef050b98792e13f660f74d8ccd1ed551b38a2937f435b', '1df633afa87a1607927205f25eff371f66683b54c91227354c415cefc7c41e23', 'a797388935b48473c612768a6f525a817a8c4e47752e465363683d71a3ccf9d2', '1cc806d251bc63ef14970a4a8e6d30e387aeb457f83badf5cb4632c9b3f5a31b', 'dc433a447665bbc3759cf3f5d1962d4edeabdeee374f9fed820c44251e06afd3', '909f431905c0b7831b3a0d3272b409b1324f0ea095265b4d84ca5fb415f647ee']"

While the interview covers ground that will be forehead-bangingly familiar to regular readers of this blog, I’m happy with how it turned out; even the slightly-garbled Google Translate output is much better than most quantum computing articles in the English-language press.

You can watch the streaming video here; my talk runs from roughly 1:17:30 to 1:56 (though if you’ve seen other complexity/physics/humor shows by me, this one is pretty similar, except for the riff about Cornell at the beginning).
The other two things in that video—a talk by Tom Henzinger about IST Austria, a bold new basic research institute that he leads, closely modeled after the Weizmann Institute in Israel; and a discussion panel about the future of programming languages—are also really interesting and worth watching. There was lots of other good stuff at this workshop, including a talk about Google Glass and its applications to photography (by, not surprisingly, a guy wearing a Google Glass—Marc Levoy); a panel discussion with three Turing Award winners, Juris Hartmanis, John Hopcroft, and Ed Clarke, about the early days of Cornell’s CS department; a talk by Amit Singhal, Google’s director of search; a talk about differential privacy by Cynthia Dwork, one of the leading researchers at the recently-closed Microsoft SVC lab (with a poignant and emotional ending); and a talk by my own lab director at MIT, Daniela Rus, about her research in robotics.
Along with the 50th anniversary celebration, Bill Gates was also on campus to dedicate Bill and Melinda Gates Hall, the new home of Cornell’s CS department. Click here for streaming video of a Q&A that Gates did with Cornell students, where I thought he acquitted himself quite well, saying many sensible things about education, the developing world, etc. that other smart people could also say, but that have extra gravitas coming from him. Gates has also become extremely effective at wrapping barbs of fact inside a soft mesh of politically-unthreatening platitudes—but listen carefully and you’ll hear the barbs. The amount of pomp and preparation around Gates’s visit reminded me of when President Obama visited MIT, befitting the two men’s approximately equal power. (Obama has nuclear weapons, but then again, he also has Congress.)
And no, I didn’t get to meet Gates or shake his hand, though I did get to stand about ten feet from him at the Gates Hall dedication. (He apparently spent most of his time at Cornell meeting with plant breeders, and other people doing things relevant to the Gates Foundation’s interests.)
Thanks so much to Bobby and Jon Kleinberg, and everyone else who invited me to this fantastic event and helped make it happen. May Cornell’s CS department have a great next 50 years.

That has got to be the worst title in the history of publishing! “Speaking Truth to Parallelism”? It doesn’t even make sense! I count myself as one of your fans, Scott, but you’re going to have to do better than that if you want anybody else to buy your book. I know you can do better — witness “Quantum Computing Since Democritus”.
However, my experiences at Cornell this week helped to convince me that, not only does “Speaking Truth to Parallelism” make perfect sense, it’s an activity that’s needed now more than ever. What it means, of course, is fighting a certain naïve, long-ago-debunked view of quantum computers—namely, that they would achieve exponential speedups by simply “trying every possible answer in parallel”—that’s become so entrenched in the minds of many journalists, laypeople, and even scientists from other fields that it feels like nothing you say can possibly dislodge it. The words out of your mouth will literally be ignored, misheard, or even contorted to the opposite of what they mean, if that’s what it takes to preserve the listener’s misconception about quantum computers being able to solve NP-hard optimization problems by sheer magic. (Much like in the Simpsons-visit-Australia episode, where Marge’s request for “coffee” is misheard over and over as “beer.”) You probably think I’m exaggerating, and I’d agree with you—if I hadn’t experienced this phenomenon hundreds of times over the last decade.
So, to take one example: after my talk at Cornell, an audience member came up to me to say that it was a wonderful talk, but that what he really wanted to know was whether I thought quantum computers could solve problems in the “NP space” in linear time, by trying all the possible solutions at once. He didn’t seem to realize that I’d spent the entire previous half hour answering that exact question, explaining why the answer was “no.” Coincidentally, this week I also got an email from a longtime reader of this blog, saying that he read and loved Quantum Computing Since Democritus, and wanted my feedback on a popular article he’d written about quantum computing. What was the gist of the article? You guessed it: “quantum computing = generic exponential speedups for optimization, machine learning, and Big Data problems, by trying all the possible answers at once.”
These people’s enthusiasm for quantum computing tends to be so genuine, so sincere, that I find myself unable to blame them—even when they’ve done the equivalent of going up to Richard Dawkins and thanking him for having taught them that evolution works for the good of the entire species, just as its wise Designer intended. I do blame the media and other careless or unscrupulous parties for misleading people about quantum computing, but most of all I blame myself, for not making my explanations clear enough. In the end, then, meeting the “NP space” folks only makes me want to redouble my efforts to Speak Truth to Parallelism: eventually, I feel, the nerd world will get this point.
Update (Oct. 4): I had regarded this (perhaps wrongly) as too obvious to state, but particularly for non-native English speakers, I’d better clarify: “speaking truth to parallelism” is a deliberate pun on the left-wing protester phrase “speaking truth to power.” So whatever linguistic oddness there is in my phrase, I’d say it simply inherits from the original.
Another Update (Oct. 7): See this comment for my short summary of what’s known about the actual technical question (can quantum computers solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, or not?).
Another Update (Oct. 8): Many commenters wrote to point out that the video of my talk at Cornell is now password-protected, and no longer publicly available. I wrote to my contacts at Cornell to ask about this, and they said they’re planning to release lightly-edited versions of the videos soon, but will look into the matter in the meantime.",6724,"['7a9fcfef7b7401e0a452db73f8e7ac58086c73c29a6d4c1f958a5a5644309abc', 'e898ba1455b7a4763f9e6d6db8251449b116676966fc92aac1d87422cc350ee3',

158,1988,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1988,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2014-09-06,Scott Aaronson,Raise a martini glass for Google and Martinis!,"OK, so for those who haven’t yet heard: this week Google’s Quantum AI Lab announced that it’s teaming up with John Martinis, of the University of California, Santa Barbara, to accelerate the Martinis group‘s already-amazing efforts in superconducting quantum computing. (See here for the MIT Tech‘s article, here for Wired‘s, and here for the WSJ‘s.) Besides building some of the best (if not the best) superconducting qubits in the world, Martinis, along with Matthias Troyer, was also one of the coauthors of two important papers that found no evidence for any speedup in the D-Wave machines. (However, in addition to working with the Martinis group, Google says it will also continue its partnership with D-Wave, in an apparent effort to keep reality more soap-operatically interesting than any hypothetical scenario one could make up on a blog.)
I have the great honor of knowing John Martinis, even once sharing the stage with him at a “Physics Cafe” in Aspen. Like everyone else in our field, I profoundly admire the accomplishments of his group: they’ve achieved coherence times in the tens of microseconds, demonstrated some of the building blocks of quantum error-correction, and gotten tantalizingly close to the fault-tolerance threshold for the surface code. (When, in D-Wave threads, people have challenged me: “OK Scott, so then which experimental quantum computing groups should be supported more?,” my answer has always been some variant of: “groups like John Martinis’s.”)
So I’m excited about this partnership, and I wish it the very best.
But I know people will ask: apart from the support and well-wishes, do I have any predictions? Alright, here’s one. I predict that, regardless of what happens, commenters here will somehow make it out that I was wrong. So for example, if the Martinis group, supported by Google, ultimately succeeds in building a useful, scalable quantum computer—by emphasizing error-correction, long coherence times (measured in the conventional way), “gate-model” quantum algorithms, universality, and all the other things that D-Wave founder Geordie Rose has pooh-poohed from the beginning—commenters will claim that still most of the credit belongs to D-Wave, for whetting Google’s appetite, and for getting it involved in superconducting QC in the first place. (The unstated implication being that, even if there were little or no evidence that D-Wave’s approach would ever lead to a genuine speedup, we skeptics still would’ve been wrong to state that truth in public.) Conversely, if this venture doesn’t live up to the initial hopes, commenters will claim that that just proves Google’s mistake: rather than “selling out to appease the ivory-tower skeptics,” they should’ve doubled down on D-Wave. Even if something completely different happens—let’s say, Google, UCSB, and D-Wave jointly abandon their quantum computing ambitions, and instead partner with ISIS to establish the world’s first “Qualiphate,” ruling with a niobium fist over California and parts of Oregon—I would’ve been wrong for having failed to foresee that. (Even if I did sort of foresee it in the last sentence…)
Yet, while I’ll never live to see the blog-commentariat acknowledge the fundamental reasonableness of my views, I might live to see scalable quantum computers become a reality, and that would surely be some consolation. For that reason, even if for no others, I once again wish the Martinis group and Google’s Quantum AI Lab the best in their new partnership.

My talk is for entertainment purposes only; it should not be taken seriously by anyone. If you reply in a way that makes clear you did take it seriously (“I’m shocked and outraged that someone who dares to call himself a scientist would … [blah blah]”), I will log your IP address, hunt you down at night, and force you to put forward an account of consciousness and decoherence that deals with all the paradoxes discussed below—and then reply at length to all criticisms of your account.
If you’d like to see titles, abstracts, and slides for all the talks from the workshop—including by Charles Bennett, Sean Carroll, James Hartle, Adrian Kent, Stefan Leichenauer, Ken Olum, Don Page, Jason Pollack, Jess Riedel, Mark Srednicki, Wojciech Zurek, and Michael Zwolak—click here. You’re also welcome to discuss these other nice talks in the comments section, though I might or might not be able to answer questions about them.
Apparently videos of all the talks will be available before long (Jess Riedel has announced that videos are now available).
(Note that, as is probably true for other talks as well, the video of my talk differs substantially from the prepared version—it mostly just consists of interruptions and my responses to them! On the other hand, I did try to work some of the more salient points from the discussion into the text below.)
Thanks so much to Charles Bennett and Jess Riedel for organizing the workshop, and to all the participants for great discussions.
I didn’t prepare slides for this talk—given the topic, what slides would I use exactly? “Spoiler alert”: I don’t have any rigorous results about the possibility of sentient quantum computers, to state and prove on slides. I thought of giving a technical talk on quantum computing theory, but then I realized that I don’t really have technical results that bear directly on the subject of the workshop, which is how the classical world we experience emerges from the quantum laws of physics. So, given the choice between a technical talk that doesn’t really address the questions we’re supposed to be discussing, or a handwavy philosophical talk that at least tries to address them, I opted for the latter, so help me God.
Let me start with a story that John Preskill told me years ago. In the far future, humans have solved not only the problem of building scalable quantum computers, but also the problem of human-level AI. They’ve built a Turing-Test-passing quantum computer. The first thing they do, to make sure this is actually a quantum computer, is ask it to use Shor’s algorithm to factor a 10,000-digit number. So the quantum computer factors the number. Then they ask it, “while you were factoring that number, what did it feel like? did you feel yourself branching into lots of parallel copies, which then recohered? or did you remain a single consciousness—a ‘unitary’ consciousness, as it were? can you tell us from introspection which interpretation of quantum mechanics is the true one?” The quantum computer ponders this for a while and then finally says, “you know, I might’ve known before, but now I just … can’t remember.”
I like to tell this story when people ask me whether the interpretation of quantum mechanics has any empirical consequences.
Look, I understand the impulse to say “let’s discuss the measure problem, or the measurement problem, or derivations of the Born rule, or Boltzmann brains, or observer-counting, or whatever, but let’s take consciousness off the table.” (Compare: “let’s debate this state law in Nebraska that says that, before getting an abortion, a woman has to be shown pictures of cute babies. But let’s take the question of whether or not fetuses have human consciousness—i.e., the actual thing that’s driving our disagreement about that and every other subsidiary question—off the table, since that one is too hard.”) The problem, of course, is that even after you’ve taken the elephant off the table (to mix metaphors), it keeps climbing back onto the table, often in disguises. So, for better or worse, my impulse tends to be the opposite: to confront the elephant directly.
Having said that, I still need to defend the claim that (a) the questions we’re discussing, centered around quantum mechanics, Many Worlds, and decoherence, and (b) the question of which physical systems should be considered “conscious,” have anything to do with each other. Many people would say that the connection doesn’t go any deeper than: “quantum mechanics is mysterious, consciousness is also mysterious, ergo maybe they’re related somehow.” But I’m not sure that’s entirely true. One thing that crystallized my thinking about this was a remark made in a lecture by Peter Byrne, who wrote a biography of Hugh Everett. Byrne was discussing the question, why did it take so many decades for Everett’s Many-Worlds Interpretation to become popular? Of course, there are people who deny quantum mechanics itself, or who have basic misunderstandings about it, but let’s leave those people aside. Why did people like Bohr and Heisenberg dismiss Everett? More broadly: why wasn’t it just obvious to physicists from the beginning that “branching worlds” is a picture that the math militates toward, probably the simplest, easiest story one can tell around the Schrödinger equation? Even if early quantum physicists rejected the Many-Worlds picture, why didn’t they at least discuss and debate it?
Here was Byrne’s answer: he said, before you can really be on board with Everett, you first need to be on board with Daniel Dennett (the philosopher). He meant: you first need to accept that a “mind” is just some particular computational process. At the bottom of everything is the physical state of the universe, evolving via the equations of physics, and if you want to know where consciousness is, you need to go into that state, and look for where computations are taking place that are sufficiently complicated, or globally-integrated, or self-referential, or … something, and that’s where the consciousness resides. And crucially, if following the equations tells you that after a decoherence event, one computation splits up into two computations, in different branches of the wavefunction, that thereafter don’t interact—congratulations! You’ve now got two consciousnesses.
And if everything above strikes you as so obvious as not to be worth stating … well, that’s a sign of how much things changed in the latter half of the 20th century. Before then, many thinkers would’ve been more likely to say, with Descartes: no, my starting point is not the physical world. I don’t even know a priori that there is a physical world. My starting point is my own consciousness, which is the one thing besides math that I can be certain about. And the point of a scientific theory is to explain features of my experience—ultimately, if you like, to predict the probability that I’m going to see X or Y if I do A or B. (If I don’t have prescientific knowledge of myself, as a single, unified entity that persists in time, makes choices, and later observes their consequences, then I can’t even get started doing science.) I’m happy to postulate a world external to myself, filled with unseen entities like electrons behaving in arbitrarily unfamiliar ways, if it will help me understand my experience—but postulating other versions of me is, at best, irrelevant metaphysics. This is a viewpoint that could lead you Copenhagenism, or to its newer variants like quantum Bayesianism.
I’m guessing that many people in this room side with Dennett, and (not coincidentally, I’d say) also with Everett. I certainly have sympathies in that direction too. In fact, I spent seven or eight years of my life as a Dennett/Everett hardcore believer. But, while I don’t want to talk anyone out of the Dennett/Everett view, I’d like to take you on a tour of what I see as some of the extremely interesting questions that that view leaves unanswered. I’m not talking about “deep questions of meaning,” but about something much more straightforward: what exactly does a computational process have to do to qualify as “conscious”?
Of course, there are already tremendous difficulties here, even if we ignore quantum mechanics entirely. Ken Olum was over much of this ground in his talk yesterday (see here for a relevant paper by Davenport and Olum). You’ve all heard the ones about, would you agree to be painlessly euthanized, provided that a complete description of your brain would be sent to Mars as an email attachment, and a “perfect copy” of you would be reconstituted there? Would you demand that the copy on Mars be up and running before the original was euthanized? But what do we mean by “before”—in whose frame of reference?
Some people say: sure, none of this is a problem! If I’d been brought up since childhood taking family vacations where we all emailed ourselves to Mars and had our original bodies euthanized, I wouldn’t think anything of it. But the philosophers of mind are barely getting started.
There’s this old chestnut, what if each person on earth simulated one neuron of your brain, by passing pieces of paper around. It took them several years just to simulate a single second of your thought processes. Would that bring your subjectivity into being? Would you accept it as a replacement for your current body? If so, then what if your brain were simulated, not neuron-by-neuron, but by a gigantic lookup table? That is, what if there were a huge database, much larger than the observable universe (but let’s not worry about that), that hardwired what your brain’s response was to every sequence of stimuli that your sense-organs could possibly receive. Would that bring about your consciousness? Let’s keep pushing: if it would, would it make a difference if anyone actually consulted the lookup table? Why can’t it bring about your consciousness just by sitting there doing nothing?
To these standard thought experiments, we can add more. Let’s suppose that, purely for error-correction purposes, the computer that’s simulating your brain runs the code three times, and takes the majority vote of the outcomes. Would that bring three “copies” of your consciousness into being? Does it make a difference if the three copies are widely separated in space or time—say, on different planets, or in different centuries? Is it possible that the massive redundancy taking place in your brain right now is bringing multiple copies of you into being?
Maybe my favorite thought experiment along these lines was invented by my former student Andy Drucker. In the past five years, there’s been a revolution in theoretical cryptography, around something called Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), which was first discovered by Craig Gentry. What FHE lets you do is to perform arbitrary computations on encrypted data, without ever decrypting the data at any point. So, to someone with the decryption key, you could be proving theorems, simulating planetary motions, etc. But to someone without the key, it looks for all the world like you’re just shuffling random strings and producing other random strings as output.
You can probably see where this is going. What if we homomorphically encrypted a simulation of your brain? And what if we hid the only copy of the decryption key, let’s say in another galaxy? Would this computation—which looks to anyone in our galaxy like a reshuffling of gobbledygook—be silently producing your consciousness?
When we consider the possibility of a conscious quantum computer, in some sense we inherit all the previous puzzles about conscious classical computers, but then also add a few new ones. So, let’s say I run a quantum subroutine that simulates your brain, by applying some unitary transformation U. But then, of course, I want to “uncompute” to get rid of garbage (and thereby enable interference between different branches), so I apply U-1. Question: when I apply U-1, does your simulated brain experience the same thoughts and feelings a second time? Is the second experience “the same as” the first, or does it differ somehow, by virtue of being reversed in time? Or, since U-1U is just a convoluted implementation of the identity function, are there no experiences at all here?
Here’s a better one: many of you have heard of the Vaidman bomb. This is a famous thought experiment in quantum mechanics where there’s a package, and we’d like to “query” it to find out whether it contains a bomb—but if we query it and there is a bomb, it will explode, killing everyone in the room. What’s the solution? Well, suppose we could go into a superposition of querying the bomb and not querying it, with only ε amplitude on querying the bomb, and √(1-ε2) amplitude on not querying it. And suppose we repeat this over and over—each time, moving ε amplitude onto the “query the bomb” state if there’s no bomb there, but moving ε2 probability onto the “query the bomb” state if there is a bomb (since the explosion decoheres the superposition). Then after 1/ε repetitions, we’ll have order 1 probability of being in the “query the bomb” state if there’s no bomb. By contrast, if there is a bomb, then the total probability we’ve ever entered that state is (1/ε)×ε2 = ε. So, either way, we learn whether there’s a bomb, and the probability that we set the bomb off can be made arbitrarily small. (Incidentally, this is extremely closely related to how Grover’s algorithm works.)
OK, now how about the Vaidman brain? We’ve got a quantum subroutine simulating your brain, and we want to ask it a yes-or-no question. We do so by querying that subroutine with ε amplitude 1/ε times, in such a way that if your answer is “yes,” then we’ve only ever activated the subroutine with total probability ε. Yet you still manage to communicate your “yes” answer to the outside world. So, should we say that you were conscious only in the ε fraction of the wavefunction where the simulation happened, or that the entire system was conscious? (The answer could matter a lot for anthropic purposes.)
You might say, sure, maybe these questions are puzzling, but what’s the alternative? Either we have to say that consciousness is a byproduct of any computation of the right complexity, or integration, or recursiveness (or something) happening anywhere in the wavefunction of the universe, or else we’re back to saying that beings like us are conscious, and all these other things aren’t, because God gave the souls to us, so na-na-na. Or I suppose we could say, like the philosopher John Searle, that we’re conscious, and the lookup table and homomorphically-encrypted brain and Vaidman brain and all these other apparitions aren’t, because we alone have “biological causal powers.” And what do those causal powers consist of? Hey, you’re not supposed to ask that! Just accept that we have them. Or we could say, like Roger Penrose, that we’re conscious and the other things aren’t because we alone have microtubules that are sensitive to uncomputable effects from quantum gravity. But neither of those two options ever struck me as much of an improvement.
Yet I submit to you that, between these extremes, there’s another position we can stake out—one that I certainly don’t know to be correct, but that would solve so many different puzzles if it were correct that, for that reason alone, it seems to me to merit more attention than it usually receives. (In an effort to give the view that attention, a couple years ago I wrote an 85-page essay called The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine, which one or two people told me they actually read all the way through.) If, after a lifetime of worrying (on weekends) about stuff like whether a giant lookup table would be conscious, I now seem to be arguing for this particular view, it’s less out of conviction in its truth than out of a sense of intellectual obligation: to whatever extent people care about these slippery questions at all, to whatever extent they think various alternative views deserve a hearing, I believe this one does as well.
The intermediate position that I’d like to explore says the following. Yes, consciousness is a property of any suitably-organized chunk of matter. But, in addition to performing complex computations, or passing the Turing Test, or other information-theoretic conditions that I don’t know (and don’t claim to know), there’s at least one crucial further thing that a chunk of matter has to do before we should consider it conscious. Namely, it has to participate fully in the Arrow of Time. More specifically, it has to produce irreversible decoherence as an intrinsic part of its operation. It has to be continually taking microscopic fluctuations, and irreversibly amplifying them into stable, copyable, macroscopic classical records.
Before I go further, let me be extremely clear about what this view is not saying. Firstly, it’s not saying that the brain is a quantum computer, in any interesting sense—let alone a quantum-gravitational computer, like Roger Penrose wants! Indeed, I see no evidence, from neuroscience or any other field, that the cognitive information processing done by the brain is anything but classical. The view I’m discussing doesn’t challenge conventional neuroscience on that account.
Secondly, this view doesn’t say that consciousness is in any sense necessary for decoherence, or for the emergence of a classical world. I’ve never understood how one could hold such a belief, while still being a scientific realist. After all, there are trillions of decoherence events happening every second in stars and asteroids and uninhabited planets. Do those events not “count as real” until a human registers them? (Or at least a frog, or an AI?) The view I’m discussing only asserts the converse: that decoherence is necessary for consciousness. (By analogy, presumably everyone agrees that some amount of computation is necessary for an interesting consciousness, but that doesn’t mean consciousness is necessary for computation.)
Thirdly, the view I’m discussing doesn’t say that “quantum magic” is the explanation for consciousness. It’s silent on the explanation for consciousness (to whatever extent that question makes sense); it seeks only to draw a defensible line between the systems we want to regard as conscious and the systems we don’t—to address what I recently called the Pretty-Hard Problem. And the (partial) answer it suggests doesn’t seem any more “magical” to me than any other proposed answer to the same question. For example, if one said that consciousness arises from any computation that’s sufficiently “integrated” (or something), I could reply: what’s the “magical force” that imbues those particular computations with consciousness, and not other computations I can specify? Or if one said (like Searle) that consciousness arises from the biology of the brain, I could reply: so what’s the “magic” of carbon-based biology, that could never be replicated in silicon? Or even if one threw up one’s hands and said everything was conscious, I could reply: what’s the magical power that imbues my stapler with a mind? Each of these views, along with the view that stresses the importance of decoherence and the arrow of time, is worth considering. In my opinion, each should be judged according to how well it holds up under the most grueling battery of paradigm-cases, thought experiments, and reductios ad absurdum we can devise.
So, why might one conjecture that decoherence, and participation in the arrow of time, were necessary conditions for consciousness? I suppose I could offer some argument about our subjective experience of the passage of time being a crucial component of our consciousness, and the passage of time being bound up with the Second Law. Truthfully, though, I don’t have any a-priori argument that I find convincing. All I can do is show you how many apparent paradoxes get resolved if you make this one speculative leap.
For starters, if you think about exactly how our chunk of matter is going to amplify microscopic fluctuations, it could depend on details like the precise spin orientations of various subatomic particles in the chunk. But that has an interesting consequence: if you’re an outside observer who doesn’t know the chunk’s quantum state, it might be difficult or impossible for you to predict what the chunk is going to do next—even just to give decent statistical predictions, like you can for a hydrogen atom. And of course, you can’t in general perform a measurement that will tell you the chunk’s quantum state, without violating the No-Cloning Theorem. For the same reason, there’s in general no physical procedure that you can apply to the chunk to duplicate it exactly: that is, to produce a second chunk that you can be confident will behave identically (or almost identically) to the first, even just in a statistical sense. (Again, this isn’t assuming any long-range quantum coherence in the chunk: only microscopic coherence that then gets amplified.)
It might be objected that there are all sorts of physical systems that “amplify microscopic fluctuations,” but that aren’t anything like what I described, at least not in any interesting sense: for example, a Geiger counter, or a photodetector, or any sort of quantum-mechanical random-number generator. You can make, if not an exact copy of a Geiger counter, surely one that’s close enough for practical purposes. And, even though the two counters will record different sequences of clicks when pointed at identical sources, the statistical distribution of clicks will be the same (and precisely calculable), and surely that’s all that matters. So, what separates these examples from the sorts of examples I want to discuss?
What separates them is the undisputed existence of what I’ll call a clean digital abstraction layer. By that, I mean a macroscopic approximation to a physical system that an external observer can produce, in principle, without destroying the system; that can be used to predict what the system will do to excellent accuracy (given knowledge of the environment); and that “sees” quantum-mechanical uncertainty—to whatever extent it does—as just a well-characterized source of random noise. If a system has such an abstraction layer, then we can regard any quantum noise as simply part of the “environment” that the system observes, rather than part of the system itself. I’ll take it as clear that such clean abstraction layers exist for a Geiger counter, a photodetector, or a computer with a quantum random number generator. By contrast, for (say) an animal brain, I regard it as currently an open question whether such an abstraction layer exists or not. If, someday, it becomes routine for nanobots to swarm through people’s brains and make exact copies of them—after which the “original” brains can be superbly predicted in all circumstances, except for some niggling differences that are traceable back to different quantum-mechanical dice rolls—at that point, perhaps educated opinion will have shifted to the point where we all agree the brain does have a clean digital abstraction layer. But from where we stand today, it seems entirely possible to agree that the brain is a physical system obeying the laws of physics, while doubting that the nanobots would work as advertised. It seems possible that—as speculated by Bohr, Compton, Eddington, and even Alan Turing—if you want to get it right you’ll need more than just the neural wiring graph, the synaptic strengths, and the approximate neurotransmitter levels. Maybe you also need (e.g.) the internal states of the neurons, the configurations of sodium-ion channels, or other data that you simply can’t get without irreparably damaging the original brain—not only as a contingent matter of technology but as a fundamental matter of physics.
(As a side note, I should stress that obviously, even without invasive nanobots, our brains are constantly changing, but we normally don’t say as a result that we become completely different people at each instant! To my way of thinking, though, this transtemporal identity is fundamentally different from a hypothetical identity between different “copies” of you, in the sense we’re talking about. For one thing, all your transtemporal doppelgängers are connected by a single, linear chain of causation. For another, outside movies like Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure, you can’t meet your transtemporal doppelgängers and have a conversation with them, nor can scientists do experiments on some of them, then apply what they learned to others that remained unaffected by their experiments.)
So, on this view, a conscious chunk of matter would be one that not only acts irreversibly, but that might well be unclonable for fundamental physical reasons. If so, that would neatly resolve many of the puzzles that I discussed before. So for example, there’s now a straightforward reason why you shouldn’t consent to being killed, while your copy gets recreated on Mars from an email attachment. Namely, that copy will have a microstate with no direct causal link to your “original” microstate—so while it might behave similarly to you in many ways, you shouldn’t expect that your consciousness will “transfer” to it. If you wanted to get your exact microstate to Mars, you could do that in principle using quantum teleportation—but as we all know, quantum teleportation inherently destroys the original copy, so there’s no longer any philosophical problem! (Or, of course, you could just get on a spaceship bound for Mars: from a philosophical standpoint, it amounts to the same thing.)
Similarly, in the case where the simulation of your brain was run three times for error-correcting purposes: that could bring about three consciousnesses if, and only if, the three simulations were tied to different sets of decoherence events. The giant lookup table and the Earth-sized brain simulation wouldn’t bring about any consciousness, unless they were implemented in such a way that they no longer had a clean digital abstraction layer. What about the homomorphically-encrypted brain simulation? That might no longer work, simply because we can’t assume that the microscopic fluctuations that get amplified are homomorphically encrypted. Those are “in the clear,” which inevitably leaks information. As for the quantum computer that simulates your thought processes and then perfectly reverses the simulation, or that queries you like a Vaidman bomb—in order to implement such things, we’d of course need to use quantum fault-tolerance, so that the simulation of you stayed in an encoded subspace and didn’t decohere. But under our assumption, that would mean the simulation wasn’t conscious.
Now, it might seem to some of you like I’m suggesting something deeply immoral. After all, the view I’m considering implies that, even if a system passed the Turing Test, and behaved identically to a human, even if it eloquently pleaded for its life, if it wasn’t irreversibly decohering microscopic events then it wouldn’t be conscious, so it would be fine to kill it, torture it, whatever you want.
But wait a minute: if a system isn’t doing anything irreversible, then what exactly does it mean to “kill” it? If it’s a classical computation, then at least in principle, you could always just restore from backup. You could even rewind and not only erase the memories of, but “uncompute” (“untorture”?) whatever tortures you had performed. If it’s a quantum computation, you could always invert the unitary transformation U that corresponded to killing the thing (then reapply U and invert it again for good measure, if you wanted). Only for irreversible systems are there moral acts with irreversible consequences.
This is related to something that’s bothered me for years in quantum foundations. When people discuss Schrödinger’s cat, they always—always—insert some joke about, “obviously, this experiment wouldn’t pass the Ethical Review Board. Nowadays, we try to avoid animal cruelty in our quantum gedankenexperiments.” But actually, I claim that there’s no animal cruelty at all in the Schrödinger’s cat experiment. And here’s why: in order to prove that the cat was ever in a coherent superposition of |Alive〉 and |Dead〉, you need to be able to measure it in a basis like {|Alive〉+|Dead〉,|Alive〉-|Dead〉}. But if you can do that, you must have such precise control over all the cat’s degrees of freedom that you can also rotate unitarily between the |Alive〉 and |Dead〉 states. (To see this, let U be the unitary that you applied to the |Alive〉 branch, and V the unitary that you applied to the |Dead〉 branch, to bring them into coherence with each other; then consider applying U-1V.) But if you can do that, then in what sense should we say that the cat in the |Dead〉 state was ever “dead” at all? Normally, when we speak of “killing,” we mean doing something irreversible—not rotating to some point in a Hilbert space that we could just as easily rotate away from.
(There followed discussion among some audience members about the question of whether, if you destroyed all records of some terrible atrocity, like the Holocaust, everywhere in the physical world, you would thereby cause the atrocity “never to have happened.” Many people seemed surprised by my willingness to accept that implication of what I was saying. By way of explaining, I tried to stress just how far our everyday, intuitive notion of “destroying all records of something” falls short of what would actually be involved here: when we think of “destroying records,” we think about burning books, destroying the artifacts in museums, silencing witnesses, etc. But even if all those things were done and many others, still the exact configurations of the air, the soil, and photons heading away from the earth at the speed of light would retain their silent testimony to the Holocaust’s reality. “Erasing all records” in the physics sense would be something almost unimaginably more extreme: it would mean inverting the entire physical evolution in the vicinity of the earth, stopping time’s arrow and running history itself backwards. Such ‘unhappening’ of what’s happened is something that we lack any experience of, at least outside of certain quantum interference experiments—though in the case of the Holocaust, one could be forgiven for wishing it were possible.)
OK, so much for philosophy of mind and morality; what about the interpretation of quantum mechanics? If we think about consciousness in the way I’ve suggested, then who’s right: the Copenhagenists or the Many-Worlders? You could make a case for either. The Many-Worlders would be right that we could always, if we chose, think of decoherence events as “splitting” our universe into multiple branches, each with different versions of ourselves, that thereafter don’t interact. On the other hand, the Copenhagenists would be right that, even in principle, we could never do any experiment where this “splitting” of our minds would have any empirical consequence. On this view, if you can control a system well enough that you can actually observe interference between the different branches, then it follows that you shouldn’t regard the system as conscious, because it’s not doing anything irreversible.
In my essay, the implication that concerned me the most was the one for “free will.” If being conscious entails amplifying microscopic events in an irreversible and unclonable way, then someone looking at a conscious system from the outside might not, in general, be able to predict what it’s going to do next, not even probabilistically. In other words, its decisions might be subject to at least some “Knightian uncertainty”: uncertainty that we can’t even quantify in a mutually-agreed way using probabilities, in the same sense that we can quantify our uncertainty about (say) the time of a radioactive decay. And personally, this is actually the sort of “freedom” that interests me the most. I don’t really care if my choices are predictable by God, or by a hypothetical Laplace demon: that is, if they would be predictable (at least probabilistically), given complete knowledge of the microstate of the universe. By definition, there’s essentially no way for my choices not to be predictable in that weak and unempirical sense! On the other hand, I’d prefer that my choices not be completely predictable by other people. If someone could put some sheets of paper into a sealed envelope, then I spoke extemporaneously for an hour, and then the person opened the envelope to reveal an exact transcript of everything I said, that’s the sort of thing that really would cause me to doubt in what sense “I” existed as a locus of thought. But you’d have to actually do the experiment (or convince me that it could be done): it doesn’t count just to talk about it, or to extrapolate from fMRI experiments that predict which of two buttons a subject is going to press with 60% accuracy a few seconds in advance.
But since we’ve got some cosmologists in the house, let me now turn to discussing the implications of this view for Boltzmann brains.
(For those tuning in from home: a Boltzmann brain is a hypothetical chance fluctuation in the late universe, which would include a conscious observer with all the perceptions that a human being—say, you—is having right now, right down to false memories and false beliefs of having arisen via Darwinian evolution. On statistical grounds, the overwhelming majority of Boltzmann brains last just long enough to have a single thought—like, say, the one you’re having right now—before they encounter the vacuum and freeze to death. If you measured some part of the vacuum state toward which our universe seems to be heading, asking “is there a Boltzmann brain here?,” quantum mechanics predicts that the probability would be ridiculously astronomically small, but nonzero. But, so the argument goes, if the vacuum lasts for infinite time, then as long as the probability is nonzero, it doesn’t matter how tiny it is: you’ll still get infinitely many Boltzmann brains indistinguishable from any given observer; and for that reason, any observer should consider herself infinitely likelier to be a Boltzmann brain than to be the “real,” original version. For the record, even among the strange people at the IBM workshop, no one actually worried about being a Boltzmann brain. The question, rather, is whether, if a cosmological model predicts Boltzmann brains, then that’s reason enough to reject the model, or whether we can live with such a prediction, since we have independent grounds for knowing that we can’t be Boltzmann brains.)
At this point, you can probably guess where this is going. If decoherence, entropy production, full participation in the arrow of time are necessary conditions for consciousness, then it would follow, in particular, that a Boltzmann brain is not conscious. So we certainly wouldn’t be Boltzmann brains, even under a cosmological model that predicts infinitely more of them than of us. We can wipe our hands; the problem is solved!
I find it extremely interesting that, in their recent work, Kim Boddy, Sean Carroll, and Jason Pollack reached a similar conclusion, but from a completely different starting point. They said: look, under reasonable assumptions, the late universe is just going to stay forever in an energy eigenstate—just sitting there doing nothing. It’s true that, if someone came along and measured the energy eigenstate, asking “is there a Boltzmann brain here?,” then with a tiny but nonzero probability the answer would be yes. But since no one is there measuring, what licenses us to interpret the nonzero overlap in amplitude with the Boltzmann brain state, as a nonzero probability of there being a Boltzmann brain? I think they, too, are implicitly suggesting: if there’s no decoherence, no arrow of time, then we’re not authorized to say that anything is happening that “counts” for anthropic purposes.
Let me now mention an obvious objection. (In fact, when I gave the talk, this objection was raised much earlier.) You might say, “look, if you really think irreversible decoherence is a necessary condition for consciousness, then you might find yourself forced to say that there’s no consciousness, because there might not be any such thing as irreversible decoherence! Imagine that our entire solar system were enclosed in an anti de Sitter (AdS) boundary, like in Greg Egan’s science-fiction novel Quarantine. Inside the box, there would just be unitary evolution in some Hilbert space: maybe even a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. In which case, all these ‘irreversible amplifications’ that you lay so much stress on wouldn’t be irreversible at all: eventually all the Everett branches would recohere; in fact they’d decohere and recohere infinitely many times. So by your lights, how could anything be conscious inside the box?”
My response to this involves one last speculation. I speculate that the fact that we don’t appear to live in AdS space—that we appear to live in (something evolving toward) a de Sitter space, with a positive cosmological constant—might be deep and important and relevant. I speculate that, in our universe, “irreversible decoherence” means: the records of what you did are now heading toward our de Sitter horizon at the speed of light, and for that reason alone—even if for no others—you can’t put Humpty Dumpty back together again. (Here I should point out, as several workshop attendees did to me, that Bousso and Susskind explored something similar in their paper The Multiverse Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.)
Does this mean that, if cosmologists discover tomorrow that the cosmological constant is negative, or will become negative, then it will turn out that none of us were ever conscious? No, that’s stupid. What it would suggest is that the attempt I’m now making on the Pretty-Hard Problem had smacked into a wall (an AdS wall?), so that I, and anyone else who stressed in-principle irreversibility, should go back to the drawing board. (By analogy, if some prescription for getting rid of Boltzmann brains fails, that doesn’t mean we are Boltzmann brains; it just means we need a new prescription. Tempting as it is to skewer our opponents’ positions with these sorts of strawman inferences, I hope we can give each other the courtesy of presuming a bare minimum of sense.)
Another question: am I saying that, in order to be absolutely certain of whether some entity satisfied the postulated precondition for consciousness, one might, in general, need to look billions of years into the future, to see whether the “decoherence” produced by the entity was really irreversible? Yes (pause to gulp bullet). I am saying that. On the other hand, I don’t think it’s nearly as bad as it sounds. After all, the category of “consciousness” might be morally relevant, or relevant for anthropic reasoning, but presumably we all agree that it’s unlikely to play any causal role in the fundamental laws of physics. So it’s not as if we’ve introduced any teleology into the laws of physics by this move.
Let me end by pointing out what I’ll call the “Tegmarkian slippery slope.” It feels scientific and rational—from the perspective of many of us, even banal—to say that, if we’re conscious, then any sufficiently-accurate computer simulation of us would also be. But I tried to convince you that this view depends, for its aura of obviousness, on our agreeing not to probe too closely exactly what would count as a “sufficiently-accurate” simulation. E.g., does it count if the simulation is done in heavily-encrypted form, or encoded as a giant lookup table? Does it matter if anyone actually runs the simulation, or consults the lookup table? Now, all the way at the bottom of the slope is Max Tegmark, who asks: to produce consciousness, what does it matter if the simulation is physically instantiated at all? Why isn’t it enough for the simulation to “exist” mathematically? Or, better yet: if you’re worried about your infinitely-many Boltzmann brain copies, then why not worry equally about the infinitely many descriptions of your life history that are presumably encoded in the decimal expansion of π? Why not hold workshops about how to avoid the prediction that we’re infinitely likelier to be “living in π” than to be our “real” selves?
From this extreme, even most scientific rationalists recoil. They say, no, even if we don’t yet know exactly what’s meant by “physical instantiation,” we agree that you only get consciousness if the computer program is physically instantiated somehow. But now I have the opening I want. I can say: once we agree that physical existence is a prerequisite for consciousness, why not participation in the Arrow of Time? After all, our ordinary ways of talking about sentient beings—outside of quantum mechanics, cosmology, and maybe theology—don’t even distinguish between the concepts “exists” and “exists and participates in the Arrow of Time.” And to say we have no experience of reversible, clonable, coherently-executable, atemporal consciousnesses is a massive understatement.
Of course, we should avoid the sort of arbitrary prejudice that Turing warned against in Computing Machinery and Intelligence. Just because we lack experience with extraterrestrial consciousnesses, doesn’t mean it would be OK to murder an intelligent extraterrestrial if we met one tomorrow. In just the same way, just because we lack experience with clonable, atemporal consciousnesses, doesn’t mean it would be OK to … wait! As we said before, clonability, and aloofness from time’s arrow, call severely into question what it even means to “murder” something. So maybe this case isn’t as straightforward as the extraterrestrials after all.
At this point, I’ve probably laid out enough craziness, so let me stop and open things up for discussion.",42083,"['6a53a626bec5506c7527891dc575d12d59ca6c2b19ed27cb63ad74e29aee2b79',

162,1792,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1792,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2014-05-13,Scott Aaronson,The NEW Ten Most Annoying Questions in Quantum Computing,"Eight years ago, I put up a post entitled The Ten Most Annoying Questions in Quantum Computing. One of the ten wasn’t a real question—it was simply a request for readers to submit questions—so let’s call it nine. I’m delighted to say that, of the nine questions, six have by now been completely settled—most recently, my question about the parallel-repeated value of the CHSH game, which Andris Ambainis pointed out to me last week can be answered using a 2008 result of Barak et al. combined with a 2013 result of Dinur and Steurer.
To be clear, the demise of so many problems is exactly the outcome I wanted. In picking problems, my goal wasn’t to shock and awe with difficulty—as if to say “this is how smart I am, that whatever stumps me will also stump everyone else for decades.” Nor was it to showcase my bottomless profundity, by proffering questions so vague, multipartite, and open-ended that no matter what progress was made, I could always reply “ah, but you still haven’t addressed the real question!” Nor, finally, was my goal to list the biggest research directions for the entire field, the stuff everyone already knows about (“is there a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for graph isomorphism?”). My interest was exclusively in “little” questions, in weird puzzles that looked (at least at the time) like there was no deep obstruction to just killing them one by one, whichever way their answers turned out. What made them annoying was that they hadn’t succumbed already.
So, now that two-thirds of my problems have met the fate they deserved, at Andris’s suggestion I’m presenting a new list of Ten Most Annoying Questions in Quantum Computing—a list that starts with the three still-unanswered questions from the old list, and then adds seven more.
But we’ll get to that shortly. First, let’s review the six questions that have been answered.
CLOSED, NO-LONGER ANNOYING QUESTIONS IN QUANTUM COMPUTING
1. Given an n-qubit pure state, is there always a way to apply Hadamard gates to some subset of the qubits, so as to make all 2n computational basis states have nonzero amplitudes? Positive answer by Ashley Montanaro and Dan Shepherd, posted to this blog in 2006.
3. Can any QMA(2) (QMA with two unentangled yes-provers) protocol be amplified to exponentially small error probability? Positive answer by Aram Harrow and Ashley Montanaro, from a FOCS’2010 paper.
4. If a unitary operation U can be applied in polynomial time, then can some square root of U also be applied in polynomial time? Positive answer by Lana Sheridan, Dmitri Maslov, and Michele Mosca, from a 2008 paper.
5. Suppose Alice and Bob are playing n parallel CHSH games, with no communication or entanglement. Is the probability that they’ll win all n games at most pn, for some p bounded below 0.853?
OK, let me relay what Andris Ambainis told me about this question, with Andris’s kind permission. First of all, we’ve known for a while that the optimal success probability is not the (3/4)n that Alice and Bob could trivially achieve by just playing all n games separately. I observed in 2006 that, by correlating their strategies between pairs of games in a clever way, Alice and Bob can win with probability (√10 / 4)n ~ 0.79n. And Barak et al. showed in 2008 that they can win with probability ((1+√5)/4)n ~ 0.81n. (Unfortunately, I don’t know the actual strategy that achieves the latter bound! Barak et al. say they’ll describe it in the full version of their paper, but the full version hasn’t yet appeared.)
Anyway, Dinur-Steurer 2013 gave a general recipe to prove that the value of a repeated projection game is at most αn, where α is some constant that depends on the game in question. When Andris followed their recipe for the CHSH game, he obtained the result α=(1+√5)/4—thereby showing that Barak et al.’s strategy, whatever it is, is precisely optimal! Andris also observes that, for any two-prover game G, the Dinur-Steurer bound α(G) is always strictly less than the entangled value ω*(G), unless the classical and entangled values are the same for one copy of the game (i.e., unless ω(G)=ω*(G)). This implies that parallel repetition can never completely eliminate a quantum advantage.
6. Forget about an oracle relative to which BQP is not in PH (the Polynomial Hierarchy). Forget about an oracle relative to which BQP is not in AM (Arthur-Merlin). Is there an oracle relative to which BQP is not in SZK (Statistical Zero-Knowledge)? Positive answer by me, posted to this blog in 2006. See also my BQP vs. PH paper for a different proof.
9. Is there an n-qubit pure state that can be prepared by a circuit of size n3, and that can’t be distinguished from the maximally mixed state by any circuit of size n2? A positive answer follows from this 2009 paper by Richard Low—thanks very much to Fernando Brandao for bringing that to my attention a few months ago.
OK, now on to:
THE NEW TEN MOST ANNOYING QUESTIONS IN QUANTUM COMPUTING
1. Can we get any upper bound whatsoever on the complexity class QMIP—i.e., quantum multi-prover interactive proofs with unlimited prior entanglement? (Since I asked this question in 2006, Ito and Vidick achieved the breakthrough lower bound NEXP⊆QMIP, but there’s been basically no progress on the upper bound side.)
2. Given any n-qubit unitary operation U, does there exist an oracle relative to which U can be (approximately) applied in polynomial time? (Since 2006, my interest in this question has only increased. See this paper by me and Greg Kuperberg for background and related results.)
3. How many mutually unbiased bases are there in non-prime-power dimensions?
4. Since Chris Fuchs was so thrilled by my including one of his favorite questions on my earlier list (question #3 above), let me add another of his favorites: do SIC-POVMs exist in arbitrary finite dimensions?
5. Is there a Boolean function f:{0,1}n→{0,1} whose bounded-error quantum query complexity is strictly greater than n/2? (Thanks to Shelby Kimmel for this question! Note that this paper by van Dam shows that the bounded-error quantum query complexity never exceeds n/2+O(√n), while this paper by Ambainis et al. shows that it’s at least n/2-O(√n) for almost all Boolean functions f.)
6. Is there a “universal disentangler”: that is, a superoperator S that takes nO(1) qubits as input; that produces a 2n-qubit bipartite state (with n qubits on each side) as output; whose output S(ρ) is always close in variation distance to a separable state; and that given an appropriate input state, can produce as output an approximation to any desired separable state? (See here for background about this problem, originally posed by John Watrous. Note that if such an S existed and were computationally efficient, it would imply QMA=QMA(2).)
7. Suppose we have explicit descriptions of n two-outcome POVM measurements—say, as d×d Hermitian matrices E1,…,En—and are also given k=(log(nd))O(1) copies of an unknown quantum state ρ in d dimensions. Is there a way to measure the copies so as to estimate the n expectation values Tr(E1ρ),…,Tr(Enρ), each to constant additive error? (A forthcoming paper of mine on private-key quantum money will contain some background and related results.)
8. Is there a collection of 1- and 2-qubit gates that generates a group of unitary matrices that is (a) not universal for quantum computation, (b) not just conjugate to permuted diagonal matrices or one-qubit gates plus swaps, and (c) not conjugate to a subgroup of the Clifford group?
9. Given a partial Boolean function f:S→{0,1} with S⊆{0,1}n, is the bounded-error quantum query complexity of f always polynomially related to the smallest degree of any polynomial p:{0,1}n→R such that (a) p(x)∈[0,1] for all x∈{0,1}n, and (b) |p(x)-f(x)|≤1/3 for all x∈S?

Is there a quantum finite automaton that reads in an infinite sequence of i.i.d. coin flips, and whose limiting probability of being found in an “accept” state is at least 2/3 if the coin is fair and at most 1/3 if the coin is unfair?

164,1767,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1767,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2014-04-01,Scott Aaronson,Waiting for BQP Fever,"Update (April 5): By now, three or four people have written in asking for my reaction to the preprint “Computational solution to quantum foundational problems” by Arkady Bolotin. (See here for the inevitable Slashdot discussion, entitled “P vs. NP Problem Linked to the Quantum Nature of the Universe.”) It gives me no pleasure to respond to this sort of thing—it would be far better to let papers this gobsmackingly uninformed about the relevant issues fade away in quiet obscurity—but since that no longer seems to be possible in the age of social media, my brief response is here.
(note: sorry, no April Fools post, just a post that happens to have gone up on April Fools)
This weekend, Dana and I celebrated our third anniversary by going out to your typical sappy romantic movie: Particle Fever, a documentary about the Large Hadron Collider. As it turns out, the movie was spectacularly good; anyone who reads this blog should go see it. Or, to offer even higher praise:
If watching Particle Fever doesn’t cause you to feel in your bones the value of fundamental science—the thrill of discovery, unmotivated by any application—then you are not truly human. You are a barnyard animal who happens to walk on its hind legs.
Indeed, I regard Particle Fever as one of the finest advertisements for science itself ever created. It’s effective precisely because it doesn’t try to tell you why science is important (except for one scene, where an economist asks a physicist after a public talk about the “return on investment” of the LHC, and is given the standard correct answer, about “what was the return on investment of radio waves when they were first discovered?”). Instead, the movie simply shows you the lives of particle physicists, of people who take for granted the urgency of knowing the truth about the basic constituents of reality. And in showing you the scientists’ quest, it makes you feel as they feel. Incidentally, the movie also shows footage of Congressmen ridiculing the uselessness of the Superconducting Supercollider, during the debates that led to the SSC’s cancellation. So, gently, implicitly, you’re invited to choose: whose side are you on?
I do have a few, not quite criticisms of the movie, but points that any viewer should bear in mind while watching it.
First, it’s important not to come away with the impression that Particle Fever shows “what science is usually like.” Sure, there are plenty of scenes that any scientist would find familiar: sleep-deprived postdocs; boisterous theorists correcting each other’s statements over Chinese food; a harried lab manager walking to the office oblivious to traffic. On the other hand, the decades-long quest to find the Higgs boson, the agonizing drought of new data before the one big money shot, the need for an entire field to coalesce around a single machine, the whole careers hitched to specific speculative scenarios that this one machine could favor or disfavor—all of that is a profoundly abnormal situation in the history of science. Particle physics didn’t used to be that way, and other parts of science are not that way today. Of course, the fact that particle physics became that way makes it unusually suited for a suspenseful movie—a fact that the creators of Particle Fever understood perfectly and exploited to the hilt.
Second, the movie frames the importance of the Higgs search as follows: if the Higgs boson turned out to be relatively light, like 115 GeV, then that would favor supersymmetry, and hence an “elegant, orderly universe.” If, on the other hand, the Higgs turned out to be relatively heavy, like 140 GeV, then that would favor anthropic multiverse scenarios (and hence a “messy, random universe”). So the fact that the Higgs ended up being 125 GeV means the universe is coyly refusing to tell us whether it’s orderly or random, and more research is needed.
In my view, it’s entirely appropriate for a movie like this one to relate its subject matter to big, metaphysical questions, to the kinds of questions anyone can get curious about (in contrast to, say, “what is the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking?”) and that the scientists themselves talk about anyway. But caution is needed here. My lay understanding, which might be wrong, is as follows: while it’s true that a lighter Higgs would tend to favor supersymmetric models, the only way to argue that a heavier Higgs would “favor the multiverse,” is if you believe that a multiverse is automatically favored by a lack of better explanations. More broadly, I wish the film had made clearer that the explanation for (some) apparent “fine-tunings” in the Standard Model might be neither supersymmetry, nor the multiverse, nor “it’s just an inexplicable accident,” but simply some other explanation that no one has thought of yet, but that would emerge from a better understanding of quantum field theory. As one example, on reading up on the subject after watching the film, I was surprised to learn that a very conservative-sounding idea—that of “asymptotically safe gravity”—was used in 2009 to predict the Higgs mass right on the nose, at 126.3 ± 2.2 GeV. Of course, it’s possible that this was just a lucky guess (there were, after all, lots of Higgs mass predictions). But as an outsider, I’d love to understand why possibilities like this don’t seem to get discussed more (there might, of course, be perfectly good reasons that I don’t know).
Third, for understandable dramatic reasons, the movie focuses almost entirely on the “younger generation,” from postdocs working on ATLAS and CMS detectors, to theorists like Nima Arkani-Hamed who are excited about the LHC because of its ability to test scenarios like supersymmetry. From the movie’s perspective, the creation of the Standard Model itself, in the 60s and 70s, might as well be ancient history. Indeed, when Peter Higgs finally appears near the end of the film, it’s as if Isaac Newton has walked onstage. At several points, I found myself wishing that some of the original architects of the Standard Model, like Steven Weinberg or Sheldon Glashow, had been interviewed to provide their perspectives. After all, their model is really the one that’s been vindicated at the LHC, not (so far) any of the newer ideas like supersymmetry or large extra dimensions.
OK, but let me come to the main point of this post. I confess that my overwhelming emotion on watching Particle Fever was one of regret—regret that my own field, quantum computing, has never managed to make the case for itself the way particle physics and cosmology have, in terms of the human urge to explore the unknown.
See, from my perspective, there’s a lot to envy about the high-energy physicists. Most importantly, they don’t perceive any need to justify what they do in terms of practical applications. Sure, they happily point to “spinoffs,” like the fact that the Web was invented at CERN. But any time they try to justify what they do, the unstated message is that if you don’t see the inherent value of understanding the universe, then the problem lies with you.
Now, no marketing consultant would ever in a trillion years endorse such an out-of-touch, elitist sales pitch. But the remarkable fact is that the message has more-or-less worked. While the cancellation of the SSC was a setback, the high-energy physicists did succeed in persuading the world to pony up the $11 billion needed to build the LHC, and to gain the information that the mass of the Higgs boson is about 125 GeV.
Now contrast that with quantum computing. To hear the media tell it, a quantum computer would be a powerful new gizmo, sort of like existing computers except faster. (Why would it be faster? Something to do with trying both 0 and 1 at the same time.) The reasons to build quantum computers are things that could make any buzzword-spouting dullard nod in recognition: cracking uncrackable encryption, finding bugs in aviation software, sifting through massive data sets, maybe even curing cancer, predicting the weather, or finding aliens. And all of this could be yours in a few short years—or some say it’s even commercially available today. So, if you check back in a few years and it’s still not on store shelves, probably it went the way of flying cars or moving sidewalks: another technological marvel that just failed to materialize for some reason.
Foolishly, shortsightedly, many academics in quantum computing have played along with this stunted vision of their field—because saying this sort of thing is the easiest way to get funding, because everyone else says the same stuff, and because after you’ve repeated something on enough grant applications you start to believe it yourself. All in all, then, it’s just easier to go along with the “gizmo vision” of quantum computing than to ask pointed questions like:
What happens when it turns out that some of the most-hyped applications of quantum computers (e.g., optimization, machine learning, and Big Data) were based on wildly inflated hopes—that there simply isn’t much quantum speedup to be had for typical problems of that kind, that yes, quantum algorithms exist, but they aren’t much faster than the best classical randomized algorithms? What happens when it turns out that the real applications of quantum computing—like breaking RSA and simulating quantum systems—are nice, but not important enough by themselves to justify the cost? (E.g., when the imminent risk of a quantum computer simply causes people to switch from RSA to other cryptographic codes? Or when the large polynomial overheads of quantum simulation algorithms limit their usefulness?) Finally, what happens when it turns out that the promises of useful quantum computers in 5-10 years were wildly unrealistic?
I’ll tell you: when this happens, the spigots of funding that once flowed freely will dry up, and the techno-journalists and pointy-haired bosses who once sang our praises will turn to the next craze. And they’re unlikely to be impressed when we protest, “no, look, the reasons we told you before for why you should support quantum computing were never the real reasons! and the real reasons remain as valid as ever!”
In my view, we as a community have failed to make the honest case for quantum computing—the case based on basic science—because we’ve underestimated the public. We’ve falsely believed that people would never support us if we told them the truth: that while the potential applications are wonderful cherries on the sundae, they’re not and have never been the main reason to build a quantum computer. The main reason is that we want to make absolutely manifest what quantum mechanics says about the nature of reality. We want to lift the enormity of Hilbert space out of the textbooks, and rub its full, linear, unmodified truth in the face of anyone who denies it. Or if it isn’t the truth, then we want to discover what is the truth.
Many people would say it’s impossible to make the latter pitch, that funders and laypeople would never understand it or buy it. But there’s an $11-billion, 17-mile ring under Geneva that speaks against their cynicism.
Anyway, let me end this “movie review” with an anecdote. The other day a respected colleague of mine—someone who doesn’t normally follow such matters—asked me what I thought about D-Wave. After I’d given my usual spiel, he smiled and said:
“See Scott, but you could imagine scientists of the 1400s saying the same things about Columbus! He had no plan that could survive academic scrutiny. He raised money under the false belief that he could reach India by sailing due west. And he didn’t understand what he’d found even after he’d found it. Yet for all that, it was Columbus, and not some academic critic on the sidelines, who discovered the new world.”
With this one analogy, my colleague had eloquently summarized the case for D-Wave, a case often leveled against me much more verbosely. But I had an answer.
“I accept your analogy!” I replied. “But to me, Columbus and the other conquerors of the Americas weren’t heroes to be admired or emulated. Motivated by gold and spices rather than knowledge, they spread disease, killed and enslaved millions in one of history’s greatest holocausts, and burned the priceless records of the Maya and Inca civilizations so that the world would never even understand what was lost. I submit that, had it been undertaken by curious and careful scientists—or at least people with a scientific mindset—rather than by swashbucklers funded by greedy kings, the European exploration and colonization of the Americas could have been incalculably less tragic.”
The trouble is, when I say things like that, people just laugh at me knowingly. There he goes again, the pie-in-the-sky complexity theorist, who has no idea what it takes to get anything done in the real world. What an amusingly contrary perspective he has.
And that, in the end, is why I think Particle Fever is such an important movie. Through the stories of the people who built the LHC, you’ll see how it really is possible to reach a new continent without the promise of gold or the allure of lies.",13117,"['f161baf5df50f1722c3f414128e2d59f9499d13d2bf42d8dd1342106dad72a3f', '980b3fd62e94e24848e6d1350a54e28ab6f5c7c88d4d0fbac5cd7adf147825ac',

165,1697,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1697,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2014-03-02,Scott Aaronson,Recent papers by Susskind and Tao illustrate the long reach of computation,"Most of the time, I’m a crabby, cantankerous ogre, whose only real passion in life is using this blog to shoot down the wrong ideas of others. But alas, try as I might to maintain my reputation as a pure bundle of seething negativity, sometimes events transpire that pierce my crusty exterior. Maybe it’s because I’m in Berkeley now, visiting the new Simons Institute for Theory of Computing during its special semester on Hamiltonian complexity. And it’s tough to keep up my acerbic East Coast skepticism of everything new in the face of all this friggin’ sunshine. (Speaking of which, if you’re in the Bay Area and wanted to meet me, this week’s the week! Email me.) Or maybe it’s watching Lily running around, her face wide with wonder. If she’s so excited by her discovery of (say) a toilet plunger or some lint on the floor, what right do I have not to be excited by actual scientific progress?
Which brings me to the third reason for my relatively-sunny disposition: two long and fascinating recent papers on the arXiv. What these papers have in common is that they use concepts from theoretical computer science in unexpected ways, while trying to address open problems at the heart of “traditional, continuous” physics and math. One paper uses quantum circuit complexity to help understand black holes; the other uses fault-tolerant universal computation to help understand the Navier-Stokes equations.
Recently, our always-pleasant string-theorist friend Luboš Motl described computational complexity theorists as “extraordinarily naïve” (earlier, he also called us “deluded” and “bigoted”). Why? Because we’re obsessed with “arbitrary, manmade” concepts like the set of problems solvable in polynomial time, and especially because we assume things we haven’t yet proved such as P≠NP. (Jokes about throwing stones from a glass house—or a stringy house—are left as exercises for the reader.) The two papers that I want to discuss today reflect a different perspective: one that regards computation as no more “arbitrary” than other central concepts of mathematics, and indeed, as something that shows up even in contexts that seem incredibly remote from it, from the AdS/CFT correspondence to turbulent fluid flow.
Our first paper is Computational Complexity and Black Hole Horizons, by Lenny Susskind. As readers of this blog might recall, last year Daniel Harlow and Patrick Hayden made a striking connection between computational complexity and the black-hole “firewall” question, by giving complexity-theoretic evidence that performing the measurement of Hawking radiation required for the AMPS experiment would require an exponentially-long quantum computation. In his new work, Susskind makes a different, and in some ways even stranger, connection between complexity and firewalls. Specifically, given an n-qubit pure state |ψ〉, recall that the quantum circuit complexity of |ψ〉 is the minimum number of 2-qubit gates needed to prepare |ψ〉 starting from the all-|0〉 state. Then for reasons related to black holes and firewalls, Susskind wants to use the quantum circuit complexity of |ψ〉 as an intrinsic clock, to measure how long |ψ〉 has been evolving for. Last week, I had the pleasure of visiting Stanford, where Lenny spent several hours explaining this stuff to me. I still don’t fully understand it, but since it’s arguable that no one (including Lenny himself) does, let me give it a shot.
My approach will be to divide into two questions. The first question is: why, in general (i.e., forgetting about black holes), might one want to use quantum circuit complexity as a clock? Here the answer is: because unlike most other clocks, this one should continue to tick for an exponentially long time!
Consider some standard, classical thermodynamic system, like a box filled with gas, with the gas all initially concentrated in one corner. Over time, the gas will diffuse across the box, in accord with the Second Law, until it completely equilibrates. Furthermore, if we know the laws of physics, then we can calculate exactly how fast this diffusion will happen. But this implies that we can use the box as a clock! To do so, we’d simply have to measure how diffused the gas was, then work backwards to determine how much time had elapsed since the gas started diffusing.
But notice that this “clock” only works until the gas reaches equilibrium—i.e., is equally spread across the box. Once the gas gets to equilibrium, which it does in a reasonably short time, it just stays there (at least until the next Poincaré recurrence time). So, if you see the box in equilibrium, there’s no measurement you could make—or certainly no “practical” measurement—that would tell you how long it’s been there. Indeed, if we model the collisions between gas particles (and between gas particles and the walls of the box) as random events, then something even stronger is true. Namely, the probability distribution over all possible configurations of the gas particles will quickly converge to an equilibrium distribution. And if you all you knew was that the particles were in the equilibrium distribution, then there’s no property of their distribution that you could point to—not even an abstract, unmeasurable property—such that knowing that property would tell you how long the gas had been in equilibrium.
Interestingly, something very different happens if we consider a quantum pure state, in complete isolation from its environment. If you have some quantum particles in a perfectly-isolating box, and you start them out in a “simple” state (say, with all particles unentangled and in a corner), then they too will appear to diffuse, with their wavefunctions spreading out and getting entangled with each other, until the system reaches “equilibrium.” After that, there will once again be no “simple” measurement you can make—say, of the density of particles in some particular location—that will give you any idea of how long the box has been in equilibrium. On the other hand, the laws of unitary evolution assure us that the quantum state is still evolving, rotating serenely through Hilbert space, just like it was before equilibration! Indeed, in principle you could even measure that the evolution was still happening, but to do so, you’d need to perform an absurdly precise and complicated measurement—one that basically inverted the entire unitary transformation that had been applied since the particles started diffusing.
Lenny now asks the question: if the quantum state of the particles continues to evolve even after “equilibration,” then what physical quantity can we point to as continuing to increase? By the argument above, it can’t be anything simple that physicists are used to talking about, like coarse-grained entropy. Indeed, the most obvious candidate that springs to mind, for a quantity that should keep increasing even after equilibration, is just the quantum circuit complexity of the state! If there’s no “magic shortcut” to simulating this system—that is, if the fastest way to learn the quantum state at time T is just to run the evolution equations forward for T time steps—then the quantum circuit complexity will continue to increase linearly with T, long after equilibration. Eventually, the complexity will “max out” at ~cn, where n is the number of particles, simply because (neglecting small multiplicative terms) the dimension of the Hilbert space is always an upper bound on the circuit complexity. After even longer amounts of time—like ~cc^n—the circuit complexity will dip back down (sometimes even to 0), as the quantum state undergoes recurrences. But both of those effects only occur on timescales ridiculously longer than anything normally relevant to physics or everyday life.
Admittedly, given the current status of complexity theory, there’s little hope of proving unconditionally that the quantum circuit complexity continues to rise until it becomes exponential, when some time-independent Hamiltonian is continuously applied to the all-|0〉 state. (If we could prove such a statement, then presumably we could also prove PSPACE⊄BQP/poly.) But maybe we could prove such a statement modulo a reasonable conjecture. And we do have suggestive weaker results. In particular (and as I just learned this Friday), in 2012 Brandão, Harrow, and Horodecki, building on earlier work due to Low, showed that, if you apply S>>n random two-qubit gates to n qubits initially in the all-|0〉 state, then with high probability, not only do you get a state with large circuit complexity, you get a state that can’t even be distinguished from the maximally mixed state by any quantum circuit with at most ~S1/6 gates.
OK, now on to the second question: what does any of this have to do with black holes? The connection Lenny wants to make involves the AdS/CFT correspondence, the “duality” between two completely different-looking theories that’s been the rage in string theory since the late 1990s. On one side of the ring is AdS (Anti de Sitter), a quantum-gravitational theory in D spacetime dimensions—one where black holes can form and evaporate, etc., but on the other hand, the entire universe is surrounded by a reflecting boundary a finite distance away, to help keep everything nice and unitary. On the other side is CFT (Conformal Field Theory): an “ordinary” quantum field theory, with no gravity, that lives only on the (D-1)-dimensional “boundary” of the AdS space, and not in its interior “bulk.” The claim of AdS/CFT is that despite how different they look, these two theories are “equivalent,” in the sense that any calculation in one theory can be transformed to a calculation in the other theory that yields the same answer. Moreover, we get mileage this way, since a calculation that’s hard on the AdS side is often easy on the CFT side and vice versa.
As an example, suppose we’re interested in what happens inside a black hole—say, because we want to investigate the AMPS firewall paradox. Now, figuring out what happens inside a black hole (or even on or near the event horizon) is a notoriously hard problem in quantum gravity; that’s why people have been arguing about firewalls for the past two years, and about the black hole information problem for the past forty! But what if we could put our black hole in an AdS box? Then using AdS/CFT, couldn’t we translate questions about the black-hole interior to questions about the CFT on the boundary, which don’t involve gravity and which would therefore hopefully be easier to answer?
In fact people have tried to do that—but frustratingly, they haven’t been able to use the CFT calculations to answer even the grossest, most basic questions about what someone falling into the black hole would actually experience. (For example, would that person hit a “firewall” and die immediately at the horizon, or would she continue smoothly through, only dying close to the singularity?) Lenny’s paper explores a possible reason for this failure. It turns out that the way AdS/CFT works, the closer to the black hole’s event horizon you want to know what happens, the longer you need to time-evolve the quantum state of the CFT to find out. In particular, if you want to know what’s going on at distance ε from the event horizon, then you need to run the CFT for an amount of time that grows like log(1/ε). And what if you want to know what’s going on inside the black hole? In line with the holographic principle, it turns out that you can express an observable inside the horizon by an integral over the entire AdS space outside the horizon. Now, that integral will include a part where the distance ε from the event horizon goes to 0—so log(1/ε), and hence the complexity of the CFT calculation that you have to do, diverges to infinity. For some kinds of calculations, the ε→0 part of the integral isn’t very important, and can be neglected at the cost of only a small error. For other kinds of calculations, unfortunately—and in particular, for the kind that would tell you whether or not there’s a firewall—the ε→0 part is extremely important, and it makes the CFT calculation hopelessly intractable.
Note that yes, we even need to continue the integration for ε much smaller than the Planck length—i.e., for so-called “transplanckian” distances! As Lenny puts it, however:
For most of this vast sub-planckian range of scales we don’t expect that the operational meaning has anything to do with meter sticks … It has more to do with large times than small distances.
One could give this transplanckian blowup in computational complexity a pessimistic spin: darn, so it’s probably hopeless to use AdS/CFT to prove once and for all that there are no firewalls! But there’s also a more positive interpretation: the interior of a black hole is “protected from meddling” by a thick armor of computational complexity. To explain this requires a digression about firewalls.
The original firewall paradox of AMPS could be phrased as follows: if you performed a certain weird, complicated measurement on the Hawking radiation emitted from a “sufficiently old” black hole, then the expected results of that measurement would be incompatible with also seeing a smooth, Einsteinian spacetime if you later jumped into the black hole to see what was there. (Technically, because you’d violate the monogamy of entanglement.) If what awaited you behind the event horizon wasn’t a “classical” black hole interior with a singularity in the middle, but an immediate breakdown of spacetime, then one says you would’ve “hit a firewall.”
Yes, it seems preposterous that “firewalls” would exist: at the least, it would fly in the face of everything people thought they understood for decades about general relativity and quantum field theory. But crucially—and here I have to disagree with Stephen Hawking—one can’t “solve” this problem by simply repeating the physical absurdities of firewalls, or by constructing scenarios where firewalls “self-evidently” don’t arise. Instead, as I see it, solving the problem means giving an account of what actually happens when you do the AMPS experiment, or of what goes wrong when you try to do it.
On this last question, it seems to me that Susskind and Juan Maldacena achieved a major advance in their much-discussed ER=EPR paper last year. Namely, they presented a picture where, sure, a firewall arises (at least temporarily) if you do the AMPS experiment—but no firewall arises if you don’t do the experiment! In other words, doing the experiment sends a nonlocal signal to the interior of the black hole (though you do have to jump into the black hole to receive the signal, so causality outside the black hole is still preserved). Now, how is it possible for your measurement of the Hawking radiation to send an instantaneous signal to the black hole interior, which might be light-years away from you when you measure? On Susskind and Maldacena’s account, it’s possible because the entanglement between the Hawking radiation and the degrees of freedom still in the black hole, can be interpreted as creating wormholes between the two. Under ordinary conditions, these wormholes (like most wormholes in general relativity) are “non-traversable”: they “pinch off” if you try to send signals through them, so they can’t be used for faster-than-light communication. However, if you did the AMPS experiment, then the wormholes would become traversable, and could carry a firewall (or an innocuous happy-birthday message, or whatever) from the Hawking radiation to the black hole interior. (Incidentally, ER stands for Einstein and Rosen, who wrote a famous paper on wormholes, while EPR stands for Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, who wrote a famous paper on entanglement. “ER=EPR” is Susskind and Maldacena’s shorthand for their proposed connection between wormholes and entanglement.)
Anyway, these heady ideas raise an obvious question: how hard would it be to do the AMPS experiment? Is sending a nonlocal signal to the interior of a black hole via that experiment actually a realistic possibility? In their work a year ago on computational complexity and firewalls, Harlow and Hayden already addressed that question, though from a different perspective than Susskind. In particular, Harlow and Hayden gave strong evidence that carrying out the AMPS experiment would require solving a problem believed to be exponentially hard even for a quantum computer: specifically, a complete problem for QSZK (Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge). In followup work (not yet written up, though see my talk at KITP and my PowerPoint slides), I showed that the Harlow-Hayden problem is actually at least as hard as inverting one-way functions, which is even stronger evidence for hardness.
All of this suggests that, even supposing we could surround an astrophysical black hole with a giant array of perfect photodetectors, wait ~1069 years for the black hole to (mostly) evaporate, then route the Hawking photons into a super-powerful, fault-tolerant quantum computer, doing the AMPS experiment (and hence, creating traversable wormholes to the black hole interior) still wouldn’t be a realistic prospect, even if the equations formally allow it! There’s no way to sugarcoat this: computational complexity limitations seem to be the only thing protecting the geometry of spacetime from nefarious experimenters.
Anyway, Susskind takes that amazing observation of Harlow and Hayden as a starting point, but then goes off on a different tack. For one thing, he isn’t focused on the AMPS experiment (the one involving monogamy of entanglement) specifically: he just wants to know how hard it is to do any experiment (possibly a different one) that would send nonlocal signals to the black hole interior. For another, unlike Harlow and Hayden, Susskind isn’t trying to show that such an experiment would be exponentially hard. Instead, he’s content if the experiment is “merely” polynomially hard—but in the same sense that (say) unscrambling an egg, or recovering a burned book from the smoke and ash, are polynomially hard. In other words, Susskind only wants to argue that creating a traversable wormhole would be “thermodynamics-complete.” A third, related, difference is that Susskind considers an extremely special model scenario: namely, the AdS/CFT description of something called the “thermofield double state.” (This state involves two entangled black holes in otherwise-separated spacetimes; according to ER=EPR, we can think of those black holes as being connected by a wormhole.) While I don’t yet understand this point, apparently the thermofield double state is much more favorable for firewall production than a “realistic” spacetime—and in particular, the Harlow-Hayden argument doesn’t apply to it. Susskind wants to show that even so (i.e., despite how “easy” we’ve made it), sending a signal through the wormhole connecting the two black holes of the thermofield double state would still require solving a thermodynamics-complete problem.
So that’s the setup. What new insights does Lenny get? This, finally, is where we circle back to the view of quantum circuit complexity as a clock. Briefly, Lenny finds that the quantum state getting more and more complicated in the CFT description—i.e., its quantum circuit complexity going up and up—directly corresponds to the wormhole getting longer and longer in the AdS description. (Indeed, the length of the wormhole increases linearly with time, growing like the circuit complexity divided by the total number of qubits.) And the wormhole getting longer and longer is what makes it non-traversable—i.e., what makes it impossible to send a signal through.
Why has quantum circuit complexity made a sudden appearance here? Because in the CFT description, the circuit complexity continuing to increase is the only thing that’s obviously “happening”! From a conventional physics standpoint, the quantum state of the CFT very quickly reaches equilibrium and then just stays there. If you measured some “conventional” physical observable—say, the energy density at a particular point—then it wouldn’t look like the CFT state was continuing to evolve at all. And yet we know that the CFT state is evolving, for two extremely different reasons. Firstly, because (as we discussed early on in this post) unitary evolution is still happening, so presumably the state’s quantum circuit complexity is continuing to increase. And secondly, because in the dual AdS description, the wormhole is continuing to get longer!
From this connection, at least three striking conclusions follow:
- That even when nothing else seems to be happening in a physical system (i.e., it seems to have equilibrated), the fact that the system’s quantum circuit complexity keeps increasing can be “physically relevant” all by itself. We know that it’s physically relevant, because in the AdS dual description, it corresponds to the wormhole getting longer!
- That even in the special case of the thermofield double state, the geometry of spacetime continues to be protected by an “armor” of computational complexity. Suppose that Alice, in one half of the thermofield double state, wants to send a message to Bob in the other half (which Bob can retrieve by jumping into his black hole). In order to get her message through, Alice needs to prevent the wormhole connecting her black hole to Bob’s from stretching uncontrollably—since as long as it stretches, the wormhole remains non-traversable. But in the CFT picture, stopping the wormhole from stretching corresponds to stopping the quantum circuit complexity from increasing! And that, in turn, suggests that Alice would need to act on the radiation outside her black hole in an incredibly complicated and finely-tuned way. For “generically,” the circuit complexity of an n-qubit state should just continue to increase, the longer you run unitary evolution for, until it hits its exp(n) maximum. To prevent that from happening would essentially require “freezing” or “inverting” the unitary evolution applied by nature—but that’s the sort of thing that we expect to be thermodynamics-complete. (How exactly do Alice’s actions in the “bulk” affect the evolution of the CFT state? That’s an excellent question that I don’t understand AdS/CFT well enough to answer. All I know is that the answer involves something that Lenny calls “precursor operators.”)
- The third and final conclusion is that there can be a physically-relevant difference between pseudorandom n-qubit pure states and “truly” random states—even though, by the definition of pseudorandom, such a difference can’t be detected by any small quantum circuit! Once again, the way to see the difference is using AdS/CFT. It’s easy to show, by a counting argument, that almost all n-qubit pure states have nearly-maximal quantum circuit complexity. But if the circuit complexity is already maximal, that means in particular that it’s not increasing! Lenny argues that this corresponds to the wormhole between the two black holes no longer stretching. But if the wormhole is no longer stretching, then it’s “vulnerable to firewalls” (i.e., to messages going through!). It had previously been argued that random CFT states almost always correspond to black holes with firewalls—and since the CFT states formed by realistic physical processes will look “indistinguishable from random states,” black holes that form under realistic conditions should generically have firewalls as well. But Lenny rejects this argument, on the ground that the CFT states that arise in realistic situations are not random pure states. And what distinguishes them from random states? Simply that they have non-maximal (and increasing) quantum circuit complexity!
I’ll leave you with a question of my own about this complexity / black hole connection: one that I’m unsure how to think about, but that perhaps interests me more than any other here. My question is: could you ever learn the answer to an otherwise-intractable computational problem by jumping into a black hole? Of course, you’d have to really want the answer—so much so that you wouldn’t mind dying moments after learning it, or not being able to share it with anyone else! But never mind that. What I have in mind is first applying some polynomial-size quantum circuit to the Hawking radiation, then jumping into the black hole to see what nonlocal effect (if any) the circuit had on the interior. The fact that the mapping between interior and exterior states is so complicated suggests that there might be complexity-theoretic mileage to be had this way, but I don’t know what. (It’s also possible that you can get a computational speedup in special cases like the thermofield double state, but that a Harlow-Hayden-like obstruction prevents you from getting one with real astrophysical black holes. I.e., that for real black holes, you’ll just see a smooth, boring, Einsteinian black hole interior no matter what polynomial-size quantum circuit you applied to the Hawking radiation.)
If you’re still here, the second paper I want to discuss today is Finite-time blowup for an averaged three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation by Terry Tao. (See also the excellent Quanta article by Erica Klarreich.) I’ll have much, much less to say about this paper than I did about Susskind’s, but that’s not because it’s less interesting: it’s only because I understand the issues even less well.
Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness is one of the seven Clay Millennium Problems (alongside P vs. NP, the Riemann Hypothesis, etc). The problem asks whether the standard, classical differential equations for three-dimensional fluid flow are well-behaved, in the sense of not “blowing up” (e.g., concentrating infinite energy on a single point) after a finite amount of time.
Expanding on ideas from his earlier blog posts and papers about Navier-Stokes (see here for the gentlest of them), Tao argues that the Navier-Stokes problem is closely related to the question of whether or not it’s possible to “build a fault-tolerant universal computer out of water.” Why? Well, it’s not the computational universality per se that matters, but if you could use fluid flow to construct general enough computing elements—resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc.—then you could use those elements to recursively shift the energy in a given region into a region half the size, and from there to a region a quarter the size, and so on, faster and faster, until you got infinite energy density after a finite amount of time.
Strikingly, building on an earlier construction by Katz and Pavlovic, Tao shows that this is actually possible for an “averaged” version of the Navier-Stokes equations! So at the least, any proof of existence and smoothness for the real Navier-Stokes equations will need to “notice” the difference between the real and averaged versions. In his paper, though, Tao hints at the possibility (or dare one say likelihood?) that the truth might go the other way. That is, maybe the “universal computer” construction can be ported from the averaged Navier-Stokes equations to the real ones. In that case, we’d have blowup in finite time for the real equations, and a negative solution to the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem. Of course, such a result wouldn’t imply that real, physical water was in any danger of “blowing up”! It would simply mean that the discrete nature of water (i.e., the fact that it’s made of H2O molecules, rather than being infinitely divisible) was essential to understanding its stability given arbitrary initial conditions.
So, what are the prospects for such a blowup result? Let me quote from Tao’s paper:
One minor point that I’d love to understand is, what happens in two dimensions? Existence and smoothness are known to hold for the 2-dimensional analogues of the Navier-Stokes equations. If they also held for the averaged 2-dimensional equations, then it would follow that Tao’s “universal computer” must be making essential use of the third dimension. How? If I knew the answer to that, then I’d feel for the first time like I had some visual crutch for understanding why 3-dimensional fluid flow is so complicated, even though 2-dimensional fluid flow isn’t.
I see that, in blog comments here and here, Tao says that the crucial difference between the 2- and 3-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations arises from the different scaling behavior of the dissipation term: basically, you can ignore it in 3 or more dimensions, but you can’t ignore it in 2. But maybe there’s a more doofus-friendly explanation, which would start with some 3-dimensional fluid logic gate, and then explain why the gate has no natural 2-dimensional analogue, or why dissipation causes its analogue to fail.
Obviously, there’s much more to say about both papers (especially the second…) than I said in this post, and many people more knowledgeable than I am to say those things. But that’s what the comments section is for. Right now I’m going outside to enjoy the California sunshine.",29008,"['bd54562202f69f865114a7fa8441ee6b17fd9d17950f6daa88cf71c83f005145',

Geordie Rose responded here. Tonight, in a Shtetl-Optimized exclusive scoop, I bring you Umesh Vazirani’s response to Geordie’s comments. Without further ado:
Even a cursory reading of our paper will reveal that Geordie Rose is attacking a straw man. Let me quickly outline the main point of our paper and the irrelevance of Rose’s comments:
To date the Boixo et al paper was the only serious evidence in favor of large scale quantum behavior by the D-Wave machine. We investigated their claims and showed that there are serious problems with their conclusions. Their conclusions were based on the close agreement between the input-output data from D-Wave and quantum simulated annealing, and their inability despite considerable effort to find any classical model that agreed with the input-output data. In our paper, we gave a very simple classical model of interacting magnets that closely agreed with the input-output data. We stated that our results implied that “it is premature to conclude that D-Wave machine exhibits large scale quantum behavior”.
Rose attacks our paper for claiming that “D-Wave processors are inherently classical, and can be described by a classical model with no need to invoke quantum mechanics.” A reading of our paper will make it perfectly clear that this is not a claim that we make. We state explicitly “It is worth emphasizing that the goal of this paper is not to provide a classical model for the D-Wave machine, … The classical model introduced here is useful for the purposes of studying the large-scale algorithmic features of the D-Wave machine. The task of finding an accurate model for the D-Wave machine (classical, quantum or otherwise), would be better pursued with direct access, not only to programming the D-Wave machine, but also to its actual hardware.”
Rose goes on to point to a large number of experiments conducted by D-Wave to prove small scale entanglement over 2-8 qubits and criticizes our paper for not trying to model those aspects of D-Wave. But such small scale entanglement properties are not directly relevant to prospects for a quantum speedup. Therefore we were specifically interested in claims about the large scale quantum behavior of D-Wave. There was exactly one such claim, which we duly investigated, and it did not stand up to scrutiny.",2497,"['653fa4e4c4b33de32acb587bc61be5cae79b8585b70bf469d810c8326cabbd47',

167,1679,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1679,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2014-02-06,Scott Aaronson,TIME’s cover story on D-Wave: A case study in the conventions of modern journalism,"This morning, commenter rrtucci pointed me to TIME Magazine’s cover story about D-Wave (yes, in today’s digital media environment, I need Shtetl-Optimized readers to tell me what’s on the cover of TIME…). rrtucci predicted that, soon after reading the article, I’d be hospitalized with a severe stress-induced bleeding ulcer. Undeterred, I grit my teeth, paid the $5 to go behind the paywall, and read the article.
The article, by Lev Grossman, could certainly be a lot worse. If you get to the end, it discusses the experiments by Matthias Troyer’s group, and it makes clear the lack of any practically-relevant speedup today from the D-Wave devices. It also includes a few skeptical quotes:
“In quantum computing, we have to be careful what we mean by ‘utilizing quantum effects,'” says Monroe, the University of Maryland scientist, who’s among the doubters. “This generally means that we are able to store superpositions of information in such a way that the system retains its ‘fuzziness,’ or quantum coherence, so that it can perform tasks that are impossible otherwise. And by that token there is no evidence that the D-Wave machine is utilizing quantum effects.”
One of the closest observers of the controversy has been Scott Aaronson, an associate professor at MIT and the author of a highly influential quantum-computing blog [aww, shucks –SA]. He remains, at best, cautious. “I’m convinced … that interesting quantum effects are probably present in D-Wave’s devices,” he wrote in an email. “But I’m not convinced that those effects, right now, are playing any causal role in solving any problems faster than we could solve them with a classical computer. Nor do I think there’s any good argument that D-Wave’s current approach, scaled up, will lead to such a speedup in the future. It might, but there’s currently no good reason to think so.”
Happily, the quote from me is something that I actually agreed with at the time I said it! Today, having read the Shin et al. paper—which hadn’t yet come out when Grossman emailed me—I might tone down the statement “I’m convinced … that interesting quantum effects are probably present” to something like: “there’s pretty good evidence for quantum effects like entanglement at a ‘local’ level, but at the ‘global’ level we really have no idea.”
Alas, ultimately I regard this article as another victim (through no fault of the writer, possibly) of the strange conventions of modern journalism. Maybe I can best explain those conventions with a quickie illustration:
MAGIC 8-BALL: THE RENEGADE MATH WHIZ WHO COULD CHANGE NUMBERS FOREVER
An eccentric billionaire, whose fascinating hobbies include nude skydiving and shark-taming, has been shaking up the scientific world lately with his controversial claim that 8+0 equals 17 [… six more pages about the billionaire redacted …] It must be said that mathematicians, who we reached for comment because we’re diligent reporters, have tended to be miffed, skeptical, and sometimes even sarcastic about the billionaire’s claims. Not surprisingly, though, the billionaire and his supporters have had some dismissive comments of their own about the mathematicians. So, which side is right? Or is the truth somewhere in the middle? At this early stage, it’s hard for an outsider to say. In the meantime, the raging controversy itself is reason enough for us to be covering this story using this story template. Stay tuned for more!
As shown (for example) by Will Bourne’s story in Inc. magazine, it’s possible for a popular magazine to break out of the above template when covering D-Wave, or at least bend it more toward reality. But it’s not easy.
More detailed comments:
- The article gets off on a weird foot in the very first paragraph, describing the insides of D-Wave’s devices as “the coldest place in the universe.” Err, 20mK is pretty cold, but colder temperatures are routinely achieved in many other physics experiments. (Are D-Wave’s the coldest current, continuously-operating experiments, or something like that?
I dunno: counterexamples, anyone?I’ve learned from experts that they’re not, not even close. I heard from someone who had a bunch of dilution fridges running at 10mK in the lab he was emailing me from…)
- The article jumps enthusiastically into the standard Quantum Computing = Exponential Parallelism Fallacy (the QC=EPF), which is so common to QC journalism that I don’t know if it’s even worth pointing it out anymore (but here I am doing so).
- Commendably, the article states clearly that QCs would offer speedups only for certain specific problems, not others; that D-Wave’s devices are designed only for adiabatic optimization, and wouldn’t be useful (e.g.) for codebreaking; and that even for optimization, “D-Wave’s hardware isn’t powerful enough or well enough understood to show serious quantum speedup yet.” But there’s a crucial further point that the article doesn’t make: namely, that we have no idea yet whether adiabatic optimization is something where quantum computers can give any practically-important speedup. In other words, even if you could implement adiabatic optimization perfectly—at zero temperature, with zero decoherence—we still don’t know whether there’s any quantum speedup to be had that way, for any of the nifty applications that the article mentions: “software design, tumor treatments, logistical planning, the stock market, airlines schedules, the search for Earth-like planets in other solar systems, and in particular machine learning.” In that respect, adiabatic optimization is extremely different from (e.g.) Shor’s factoring algorithm or quantum simulation: things where we know how much speedup we could get, at least compared to the best currently-known classical algorithms. But I better stop now, since I feel myself entering an infinite loop (and I didn’t even need the adiabatic algorithm to detect it).",5877,"['8ab6bde853152525cb4a7b5506b4cc800217397e30c3a5859911935366d89756', 'be735dc39f6a92b471d4319b0ade774b14a7560e02d58c034a24444d1fffbf05', '1e230aea402cf2499efd2ad9c31c97bca2027589f5bb1bd37f4bfd30606377ab', 'ab71120ef327dfc13d67c2c550f0677ee666a21c18b80aa610df39cf62a375b2', '052455ef3a911ba8d6d75f5ea55fb2950b4fa399d54fff3abce2c8d2ef0acb7a', '316c547c67923ab22af0baffa6024196dbd886d375f5d1ce816dff94a57f3e14', '78eb205f113357bc08a79f3977b9cf0c3248854bf8d82bc5536f0cb45c1b50e5', '1b10f7c2fa7c840c51d2142a3ada08e3af926e0fdff1bcc901523c657d44507f', 'c91ecb8d94ee273e2e3f22791ea56e51bf02e21078d2660f9009a4cd2826cd66', 'b7d610a31e3db8819ce5508da453fab48058091a05ee5740d6fb1624fdd0f32a', 'aa8a608d40b29ef37bd9f85f0737304d3471d2e39eb5e24a04f41471fbf065fc', '698f82156628c63a026ceb8d1ddaf4dd3524f2d99b1b4ad7691838f7c8056c66', 'f1cf180f77f21b2f8c03eb7fc174220d5835c0da32475fe477617288763db031', 'dd83eabda127eb11449a76bca3edd8f0c8e8e0a9de4f8e012226463c4fd8dee4', '63984f6018fa4bcb49dd2908c9dc38de1215a94f814e2f9a08360533ad21f608', '746603cd2d6b1f3275ae4f3a42391cc5f67a0e6c7c346200336bb2ce428065b3', '30df0c4638040cc8775dccb8ffff7be162bece704dccfa63e6a340d389ecac63', '3e3729d737210b0bce8ef1890e8098a7d53670803b1eeb0a6cdec70d17348994', '02eeb95ecb3da5e48298a58cea7493937fa81f1d607390b0287c2b0792592d77', 'f2205062ab6ffb44c4dd11d48f8b482384c0867b675d0af6f6e23bdc4f4daf4e', '4cba26654941428bd7ec8b803a8252eb97c6d7b1e901c2c2f2215f95075858cd', 'f8c5e0adb6a19713509c3f67f307667ae6f05d21983a266be35361402327017d', '083b71a80c5bf2afc8f2ba9269a5a4835ba424387308e51569ba67607d09ed96', 'f3eb624ac283a65a2840e9c8411def290196d6640d988a730390ce645d9fa329', 'eed467b706b27f4bba82648c9e6d82cb63dbb801c5c942c6ff4bf4c8d77dc83b', '245a5b7d5c88e8ed63bd73f63be83bc104c94890fd85140da43c0c3cbc549890', '853ad3da1ac1687914c57f18f889a1e975657891fd9c2cb533a73e05d2e9dff8', '85870beb1a9ece4256f677061932e62f4c561c252aeaa73489be854b4069401a', '777dab077471ff429c6d0c369797ad5b66203e811c304ad2e62ac0e86589aadb', '4d599cf422e51a42e36e7f22ad211a643cd989cece78db611a20a47bff575f36', 'f716001450db7762aea785b97126beee97e2d61aae95e52916eabf19ffa15833']"
168,1668,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1668,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2014-01-31,Scott Aaronson,More “tweets”,"Update (Feb. 4): After Luke Muelhauser of MIRI interviewed me about “philosophical progress,” Luke asked me for other people to interview about philosophy and theoretical computer science. I suggested my friend and colleague Ronald de Wolf of the University of Amsterdam, and I’m delighted that Luke took me up on it. Here’s the resulting interview, which focuses mostly on quantum computing (with a little Kolmogorov complexity and Occam’s Razor thrown in). I read the interview with admiration (and hoping to learn some tips): Ronald tackles each question with more clarity, precision, and especially levelheadedness than I would.
Another Update: Jeff Kinne asked me to post a link to a forum about the future of the Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC)—and in particular, whether it should continue to be affiliated with the IEEE. Any readers who have ever had any involvement with the CCC conference are encouraged to participate. You can read all about what the issues are in a manifesto written by Dieter van Melkebeek.

169,1643,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1643,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2014-01-16,Scott Aaronson,What happens when an unstoppable PR force hits an NP-hard problem? The answer’s getting clearer,"Update (Jan. 23): Daniel Lidar, one of the authors of the “Defining and detecting…” paper, was kind enough to email me his reactions to this post. While he thought the post was generally a “very nice summary” of their paper, he pointed out one important oversight in my discussion. Ironically, this oversight arose from my desire to bend over backwards to be generous to D-Wave! Specifically, I claimed that there were maybe ~10% of randomly-chosen 512-qubit problem instances on which the D-Wave Two slightly outperformed the simulated annealing solver (compared to ~75% where simulated annealing outperformed the D-Wave Two), while also listing several reasons (such as the minimum annealing time, and the lack of any characterization of the “good” instances) why that “speedup” is likely to be entirely an artifact. I obtained the ~10% and ~75% figures by eyeballing Figure 7 in the paper, and looking at which quantiles were just above and just below the 100 line when N=512.
However, I neglected to mention that even the slight “speedup” on ~10% of instances, only appears when one looks at the “quantiles of ratio”: in other words, when one plots the probability distribution of [Simulated annealing time / D-Wave time] over all instances, and then looks at (say) the ~10% of the distribution that’s best for the D-Wave machine. The slight speedup disappears when one looks at the “ratio of quantiles”: that is, when one (say) divides the amount of time that simulated annealing needs to solve its best 10% of instances, by the amount of time that the D-Wave machine needs to solve its best 10%. And Rønnow et al. give arguments in their paper that ratio of quantiles is probably the more relevant performance comparison than quantiles of ratio. (Incidentally, the slight speedup on a few instances also only appears for certain values of the parameter r, which controls how many possible settings there are for each coupling. Apparently it appears for r=1, but disappears for r=3 and r=7—thereby heightening one’s suspicion that we’re dealing with an artifact of the minimum annealing time or something like that, rather than a genuine speedup.)
There’s one other important point in the paper that I didn’t mention: namely, all the ratios of simulated annealing time to D-Wave time are normalized by 512/N, where N is the number of spins in the instance being tested. In this way, one eliminates the advantages of the D-Wave machine that come purely from its parallelism (which has nothing whatsoever to do with “quantumness,” and which could easily skew things in D-Wave’s favor if not controlled for), while still not penalizing the D-Wave machine in absolute terms.
A few days ago, a group of nine authors (Troels Rønnow, Zhihui Wang, Joshua Job, Sergio Boixo, Sergei Isakov, David Wecker, John Martinis, Daniel Lidar, and Matthias Troyer) released their long-awaited arXiv preprint Defining and detecting quantum speedup, which contains the most thorough performance analysis of the D-Wave devices to date, and which seems to me to set a new standard of care for any future analyses along these lines. Notable aspects of the paper: it uses data from the 512-qubit machine (a previous comparison had been dismissed by D-Wave’s supporters because it studied the 128-qubit model only); it concentrates explicitly from the beginning on comparisons of scaling behavior between the D-Wave devices and comparable classical algorithms, rather than getting “sidetracked” by other issues; and it includes authors from both USC and Google’s Quantum AI Lab, two places that have made large investments in D-Wave’s machines and have every reason to want to see them succeed.
Let me quote the abstract in full:
The development of small-scale digital and analog quantum devices raises the question of how to fairly assess and compare the computational power of classical and quantum devices, and of how to detect quantum speedup. Here we show how to define and measure quantum speedup in various scenarios, and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake quantum speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from a randomized benchmark test on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. Comparing the performance of the device on random spin glass instances with limited precision to simulated classical and quantum annealers, we find no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered, and obtain inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results for one particular benchmark do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate that quantum speedup is elusive and can depend on the question posed.
Since the paper is exceedingly well-written, and since I have maybe an hour before I’m called back to baby duty, my inclination is simply to ask people to RTFP rather than writing yet another long blog post. But maybe there are four points worth calling attention to:
- The paper finds, empirically, that the time needed to solve random size-N instances of the quadratic binary optimization (QUBO) problem on D-Wave’s Chimera constraint graph seems to scale like exp(c√N) for some constant c—and that this is true regardless of whether one attacks the problem using the D-Wave Two, quantum Monte Carlo (i.e., a classical algorithm that tries to mimic the native physics of the machine), or an optimized classical simulated annealing code. Notably, exp(c√N) is just what one would have predicted from theoretical arguments based on treewidth; and the constant c doesn’t appear to be better for the D-Wave Two than for simulated annealing.
- The last sentence of the abstract (“Our results … do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems”) is, of course, the reed on which D-Wave’s supporters will now have to hang their hopes. But note that it’s unclear what experimental results could ever “rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems.” (No matter how many wrong predictions a psychic has made, the possibility remains that she’d be flawless at predicting the results of Croatian ping-pong tournaments…) Furthermore, like with previous experiments, the instances tested all involved finding ground states for random coupling configurations of the D-Wave machine’s own architecture. In other words, this was a set of instances where one might have thought, a priori, that the D-Wave machine would have an immense home-field advantage. Thus, one really needs to look more closely, to see whether there’s any positive evidence for an asymptotic speedup by the D-Wave machine.
- Here, for D-Wave supporters, the biggest crumb the paper throws is that, if one considers only the ~10% of instances on which the D-Wave machine does best, then the machine does do slightly better on those instances than simulated annealing does. (Conversely, simulated annealing does better than the D-Wave machine on the ~75% of instances on which it does best.) Unfortunately, no one seems to know how to characterize the instances on which the D-Wave machine will do best: one just has to try it and see what happens! And of course, it’s extremely rare that two heuristic algorithms will succeed or fail on exactly the same set of instances: it’s much more likely that their performances will be correlated, but imperfectly. So it’s unclear, at least to me, whether this finding represents anything other than the “noise” that would inevitably occur even if one classical algorithm were pitted against another one.
- As the paper points out, there’s also a systematic effect that biases results in the D-Wave Two’s favor, if one isn’t careful. Namely, the D-Wave Two has a minimum annealing time of 20 microseconds, which is often greater than the optimum annealing time, particularly for small instance sizes. The effect of that is artificially to increase the D-Wave Two’s running time for small instances, and thereby make its scaling behavior look better than it really is. The authors say they don’t know whether even the D-Wave Two’s apparent advantage for its “top 10% of instances” will persist after this effect is fully accounted for.
Those seeking something less technical might want to check out an excellent recent article in Inc. by Will Bourne, entitled “D-Wave’s dream machine” (“D-Wave thinks it has built the first commercial quantum computer. Mother Nature has other ideas”). Wisely, Bourne chose not to mention me at all in this piece. Instead, he gradually builds a skeptical case almost entirely on quotes from people like Seth Lloyd and Daniel Lidar, who one might have thought would be more open to D-Wave’s claims. Bourne’s piece illustrates that it is possible for the mainstream press to get the D-Wave story pretty much right, and that you don’t even need a physics background to do so: all you need is a willingness to commit journalism.
Oh. I’d be remiss not to mention that, in the few days between the appearance of this paper and my having a chance to write this post, two other preprints of likely interest to the Shtetl-Optimized commentariat showed up on quant-ph. The first, by a large list of authors mostly from D-Wave, is called Entanglement in a quantum annealing processor. This paper presents evidence for a point that many skeptics (including me) had been willing to grant for some time: namely, that the states generated by the D-Wave machines contain some nonzero amount of entanglement. (Note that, because of a technical property called “stoquasticity,” such entanglement is entirely compatible with the machines continuing to be efficiently simulable on a classical computer using Quantum Monte Carlo.) While it doesn’t address the performance question at all, this paper seems like a perfectly fine piece of science.
From the opposite side of the (eigen)spectrum comes the latest preprint by QC skeptic Michel Dyakonov, entitled Prospects for quantum computing: Extremely doubtful. Ironically, Dyakonov and D-Wave seem to agree completely about the irrelevance of fault-tolerance and other insights from quantum computing theory. It’s just that D-Wave thinks QC can work even without the theoretical insights, whereas Dyakonov thinks that QC can’t work even with the insights. Unless I missed it, there’s no new scientific content in Dyakonov’s article. It’s basically a summary of some simple facts about QC and quantum fault-tolerance, accompanied by sneering asides about how complicated and implausible it all sounds, and how detached from reality the theorists are.
And as for the obvious comparisons to previous “complicated and implausible” technologies, like (say) classical computing, or heavier-than-air flight, or controlled nuclear fission? Dyakonov says that such comparisons are invalid, because they ignore the many technologies proposed in previous eras that didn’t work. What’s striking is how little he seems to care about why the previous technologies failed: was it because they violated clearly-articulated laws of physics? Or because there turned out to be better ways to do the same things? Or because the technologies were simply too hard, too expensive, or too far ahead of their time? Supposing QC to be impossible, which of those is the reason for the impossibility? Since we’re not asking about something “arbitrary” here (like teaching a donkey to read), but rather about the computational power of Nature itself, isn’t it of immense scientific interest to know the reason for QC’s impossibility? How does Dyakonov propose to learn the reason, assuming he concedes that he doesn’t already know it?
(As I’ve said many times, I’d support even the experiments that D-Wave was doing, if D-Wave and its supporters would only call them for what they were: experiments. Forays into the unknown. Attempts to find out what happens when a particular speculative approach is thrown at NP-hard optimization problems. It’s only when people obfuscate the results of those experiments, in order to claim something as “commercially useful” that quite obviously isn’t yet, that they leave the realm of science, and indeed walk straight into the eager jaws of skeptics like Dyakonov.)
Anyway, since we seem to have circled back to D-Wave, I’d like to end this post by announcing my second retirement as Chief D-Wave Skeptic. The first time I retired, it was because I mistakenly thought that D-Wave had fundamentally changed, and would put science ahead of PR from that point forward. (The truth seems to be that there were, and are, individuals at D-Wave committed to science, but others who remain PR-focused.) This time, I’m retiring for a different reason: because scientists like the authors of the “Defining and detecting” preprint, and journalists like Will Bourne, are doing my job better than I ever did it. If the D-Wave debate were the American Civil War, then my role would be that of the frothy-mouthed abolitionist pamphleteer: someone who repeats over and over points that are fundamentally true, but in a strident manner that serves only to alienate fence-sitters and allies. As I played my ineffective broken record, the Wave Power simply moved from one triumph to another, expanding its reach to Google, NASA, Lockheed Martin, and beyond. I must have looked like a lonely loon on the wrong side of history.
But today the situation is different. Today Honest Abe and his generals (Honest Matthias and his coauthors?) are meeting the Wave Power on the battlefield of careful performance comparisons against Quantum Monte Carlo and simulated annealing. And while the battles might continue all the way to 2000 qubits or beyond, the results so far are not looking great for the Wave Power. The intractability of NP-complete problems—that which we useless, ivory-tower theorists had prophesied years ago, to much derision and laughter—would seem to be rearing its head. So, now that the bombs are bursting and the spins decohering in midair, what is there for a gun-shy pampleteer like myself to do but sit back and watch it all play out?
Well, and maybe blog about it occasionally. But not as “Chief Skeptic,” just as another interested observer.",14157,"['517a5f00007210eeff41c9c22440debf63020cd90e2d7538e75d82df8f9d9edd',

The interview accompanies their lead article about quantum computing and the NSA, which also quotes me (among many others), and which reports—unsurprisingly—that the NSA is indeed interested in building scalable quantum computers but, based on the Snowden documents, appears to be quite far from that goal.
(Warning: The interview contains a large number of typos and other errors, which might have arisen from my infelicities in speaking or the poor quality of the phone connection. Some were corrected but others remain.)
The week before last, I was in Rio de Janeiro to give a mini-course on “Complexity Theory and Quantum Optics” at the Instituto de Física of the Universidade Federal Fluminense. Next week I’ll be giving a similar course at the Jerusalem Winter School on Quantum Information.
In the meantime, my host in Rio, Ernesto Galvão, and others were kind enough to make detailed, excellent notes for my five lectures in Rio. You can click the link in the last sentence to get them, or here are links for the five lectures individually:
If you have questions or comments about the lectures, leave them here (since I might not check the quantumrio blog).
One other thing: I can heartily recommend a trip to Rio to anyone interested in quantum information—or, for that matter, to anyone interested in sunshine, giant Jesus statues, or (especially) fruit juices you’ve never tasted before. My favorite from among the latter was acerola. Also worth a try are caja, mangaba, guarana, umbu, seriguela, amora, and fruta do conde juices—as well as caju and cacao, even though they taste almost nothing like the more commercially exportable products from the same plants (cashews and chocolate respectively). I didn’t like cupuaçu or graviola juices. Thanks so much to Ernesto and everyone else for inviting me (not just because of the juice).
Update (January 2): You can now watch videos of my mini-course at the Jerusalem Winter School here.
Videos of the other talks at the Jerusalem Winter School are available from the same site (just scroll through them on the right).",2214,"['3512d0350e41a253c4eef79bdc7fda24a4fe736b89f1cab77d55223573cd39da', '8828a3200bc3fb3e901583275c5ea91025e6396dfacc90a9fbdeffb51bc79445', '0ce517bdd91646e041cf6ba9f1ef9abb5a854427a559f95e4cdee09bf08cdba5', 'cb5a05d95c0ae2a2bbd23dcc963c3687d058fcc6df60fbe63651204451c9fe14', '9c7636ed1fa470de1b671ad69d9871ae2cc7d62b35ac300a494830725c251599', '0bbac47a4ca3fb3416531a57cc2fc1b913efb38e79ff19694a2e22b9d5889904', 'c12c089690f5b0694484f5f32279f6af44cf2e8d240375b4052798a1ff7c3f10', '3695c01027e433c50c1e9d160a25a9170d48dbc3373a40bfb4ed837acd7fad86', '36357ae97ad1fb450b9021e4bc5c8c61898626274eca936fc61ad3a222f935e0', 'a79e4e6518e1cd8be2f69923dc5975ccd71979cc6d9b3f76ae7ee00d5658fdd6', '1b577e5140e9231a0dd7c575c3073efcd1e715568baf644ce53970b560d04e99', '20ae30283b191f73324cc37aad00e30af06df0af414d1ceae927e120ea4701ea', 'a48cc083d10c5ece5869cf2179bf1d54bb76a56f2014868ff84e4e62d9c04dce', 'db843941dd8cc5b287e490e9111279f389d008e4e1c203ece9f1648b89692e6d', '7bceb7a57984c78da57f9a073f37da7cce9edbce0e4a49551ebe4abbdc27175e', '6c43365f08bcb0e8482f9d830995465db8136912edc6c670e61d363b1e63bd40', '5b9e227a4011e03687e44754bbb3e4121cf40e31483f581562516c5c71d66cf4', '8e12640d688e91679076d46459e6ef8551424bfd99dc3252c4b387c6e7ec8cb5', '844b859f57d305f383bdcfb960c72db16a335290796ea42e2cf6f1287221b922', '121787f9e205891ee1a8574d6b6d9c938c1df0059714b16df9ea71d33601a7da', 'c8db1624c0713ba68f5d9e1063219e70a336021bb672985c4a0372770eb5e61d', '9db4edef4e79f344b2734a922ffd21d08305e2bd8976f072dd33c4d764f8e958', '98f3d2438eacc358f90ca859056b132d71b0e318f97410ec6ab8209a5b471015', '67def641c6bfe1713b0e61ecf3d20d8ab26c9eea004a6fb3fc0a6e45f4f39f2e', 'a0b4be9788ed723c2a3bae80c4d21026c5b8bb784e05b4a1c6201e25bdfc0e38', 'b66c32cec2a340089a518542c84f7994636d04c622c4701161697fe70d31def0', '6faf0b2f2ffe1cb397f7ac05fe4f0a06cc7da018372afd639cf514de8d7ef6a3', '2e966ec22450102bf0738ed7f62825b921be5b162f1ae22ba658bf5698b3fc27', 'f558865e4ecf727fd8e47ad7532d117cdbb86762c5498b31aa7578257e87f9c7', '360bbfc63f04f363b9b84c920c6f1395f62bb72e59e5b3dfa054ec1ae501d7c6', '91784a6e65ff76e7d96ca161340f26a727f34b3362cc65de2cc10fc2e4772210', 'ad1ca9e58f9ac58524294fdb417ab192c25da9c44252492f45232a0d53c24b56', '68e0617383eb2e8d6a9639926a755b41887f07354c20801ef9e9f6e60335dcf6', '58b40c3596b7408565f711b4f4b92a5a6ef0ce86da28b4faecde49a4b7983088', '5643a5980926d2efde524484c1c3d1a54eb5d064ad6f56940914467308a8e748', '3bbb2eb3940a8104f975e87fc37c5ae836ec285b0ba0c91fce2a910e872c3467', 'd1d1a56e77082237a36920b9be25fd6d2ff0da1061b05680b8836c6ce30c6ab5', '8c164ed2309c05b070353d4631c413a9db36d2a46edd75c659ca35b7e31986b8', 'f53c70a10356e2586448076ec0fc4c7b90217f82b1987385578ed4fe438d4b33', '6f6660566d0ca33d38a3e41cf16d8df98f5d2baa68d3ef226c2bbd587cff0773', 'cf27e92346a32b322b19156f25d11da24d519f666a09e4ca0583b9862fb5ca8a', '0e78b1acf4fd2231d42263ab96f7b334bcf2ec3485db9b235b13796d69a0c983', 'fe181791777017e52fd6446fc79da309c93840e020cbe2ff344e8408e78ad8eb', '3b9ff0f7a5a7dcc78f56db4e53233845498df5a148d4abf9978fdf25f9dea696', 'f1c6f3a15615f054cfb630aaca573e4cd2d796887c525a404712e30911b2e1fb', '70281e4490e83c11950c11ecbf9d86c895dd552f063c0dc17aa3f96ea6f083b7']"

My quantum computing research explained, using only the 1000 most common English words","Merry Christmas! My quantum computing research explained, using only the 1000 most common English words
I study computers that would work in a different way than any computer that we have today. These computers would be very small, and they would use facts about the world that are not well known to us from day to day life. No one has built one of these computers yet—at least, we don’t think they have!—but we can still reason about what they could do for us if we did build them.
How would these new computers work? Well, when you go small enough, you find that, in order to figure out what the chance is that something will happen, you need to both add and take away a whole lot of numbers—one number for each possible way that the thing could happen, in fact. What’s interesting is, this means that the different ways a thing could happen can “kill each other out,” so that the thing never happens at all! I know it sounds weird, but the world of very small things has been known to work that way for almost a hundred years.
So, with the new kind of computer, the idea is to make the different ways each wrong answer could be reached kill each other out (with some of them “pointing” in one direction, some “pointing” in another direction), while the different ways that the right answer could be reached all point in more or less the same direction. If you can get that to happen, then when you finally look at the computer, you’ll find that there’s a very good chance that you’ll see the right answer. And if you don’t see the right answer, then you can just run the computer again until you do.
For some problems—like breaking a big number into its smallest parts (say, 43259 = 181 × 239)—we’ve learned that the new computers would be much, much faster than we think any of today’s computers could ever be. For other problems, however, the new computers don’t look like they’d be faster at all. So a big part of my work is trying to figure out for which problems the new computers would be faster, and for which problems they wouldn’t be.
You might wonder, why is it so hard to build these new computers? Why don’t we have them already? This part is a little hard to explain using the words I’m allowed, but let me try. It turns out that the new computers would very easily break. In fact, if the bits in such a computer were to “get out” in any way—that is, to work themselves into the air in the surrounding room, or whatever—then you could quickly lose everything about the new computer that makes it faster than today’s computers. For this reason, if you’re building the new kind of computer, you have to keep it very, very carefully away from anything that could cause it to lose its state—but then at the same time, you do have to touch the computer, to make it do the steps that will eventually give you the right answer. And no one knows how to do all of this yet. So far, people have only been able to use the new computers for very small checks, like breaking 15 into 3 × 5. But people are working very hard today on figuring out how to do bigger things with the new kind of computer.
In fact, building the new kind of computer is so hard, that some people even believe it won’t be possible! But my answer to them is simple. If it’s not possible, then that’s even more interesting to me than if it is possible! And either way, the only way I know to find out the truth is to try it and see what happens.
Sometimes, people pretend that they already built one of these computers even though they didn’t. Or they say things about what the computers could do that aren’t true. I have to admit that, even though I don’t really enjoy it, I do spend a lot of my time these days writing about why those people are wrong.
Oh, one other thing. Not long from now, it might be possible to build computers that don’t do everything that the new computers could eventually do, but that at least do some of it. Like, maybe we could use nothing but light and mirrors to answer questions that, while not important in and of themselves, are still hard to answer using today’s computers. That would at least show that we can do something that’s hard for today’s computers, and it could be a step along the way to the new computers. Anyway, that’s what a lot of my own work has been about for the past four years or so.
Besides the new kind of computers, I’m also interested in understanding what today’s computers can and can’t do. The biggest open problem about today’s computers could be put this way: if a computer can check an answer to a problem in a short time, then can a computer also find an answer in a short time? Almost all of us think that the answer is no, but no one knows how to show it. Six years ago, another guy and I figured out one of the reasons why this question is so hard to answer: that is, why the ideas that we already know don’t work.
Anyway, I have to go to dinner now. I hope you enjoyed this little piece about the kind of stuff that I work on.",4974,"['a4787ed8b898cabaa9063147328695ad30614fb9e1cef3a9fd2518e4adb926b0', 'dea104034dd56df37f436c9c11ea85f0b4b656110e4ac1ec005a356251997b5a', '9641dd4b7550b41b204921819232da0138e41297dbbf3290fb38272e37757b63', '16bfb8058d7cf7ee3aafaf065741674591697a961fbbf4454bdb1ff5a095fc4d', '553a8d8a223852829925677fe3bd6a5fd8a4b280a413aeaaddb8e9d81a30d875', '19c3bcbbca5dbbd83cc5778b5672fa71e7f001caa493d2e2bb6f4fec21857837', 'da1261ae1ed9a02e9257b08c98e8fab496ec8d3b635dbf1a1564d7f02eee6507', 'c5cdf07ab0e12271b000b66936cac09f408461e94f23b42c3b96a3025c7fd39f', 'ff872a55be7c7bb91bb6aab9db3d568b34e4edee5c615a232d45fd4dded11f15', '6e0486becfb22d556cde7b616e3ce66107f8de0b95852dfabe522ba9576e50d3', 'e8819e95828e4a20c083e74d35400763a08c766829ccbf9858114af13a6d77ea', '3681eca1676696146918792c1de73d57104a03f905b7e06bf04fc5c84b1c61b4', '6f7adc114a3da116fb1bee94e12a2a47a40df0e237347b9c9c10c911b8c17f65', '1bba9663466c08797082882080ff68ecd82225a5f52413b01001667476955c03', '31a0faef681cb660ff6a87aece353f5f3d1efc26a0d5c1f140e02396380d2fcf', '1da1f451569aab33eff6fac70ddfa7c9949a240da819f8f424cfcc7c49e029ec', '4bdd9988d2a03ffda76a0787fca0187318bb81983ca8f992e7db2b00a28e905e', '13c9d881e49175484a9922ffbba5651891c5af23ff44577ff30ae9e7b3a7c14f', 'bae4ae3fa27a54d293ba75c3dfda4f255acf2efbb24b2dc052cb49337178aa99', 'ccf4790cebeae7adf37cc2716466590b6018f88e4f4e5621ca23cac8dd5ced87', 'c38a845f6fe638aa0f792209adbf71958462b142b2c4f92245580681062e0027', '0cf53ec800dbe8b3eb8096c567d90179c351f53bb5985443954237a7786758f3', '198e160c7209c4b7d971cd9a20b4874b0d77bc4b465411c7d8909776977de6b6', '6df7ea7c9fa576c10b345b2b515fc95c3daadbaa142765084fc446af32085c3f', 'd59b64e65cb53a4a3eaff2afc861cf458e36e8242768969c22469680e5762883', '4638cdece098f9d673870658f5d6223fae9847887a4bd8fb3edb93963b29c20d', '5c00aa0a589e7c40e51301256d57cb32630b83bd8e43198d235dc04e17e4a682', 'b5c848904ca683e383de0400be26087f24d12ad38cfa4f0b914ced13b9599274']"

Update (11/13): See here for video of a fantastic talk that Matthias Troyer gave at Stanford, entitled “Quantum annealing and the D-Wave devices.” The talk includes the results of experiments on the 512-qubit machine. (Thanks to commenter jim for the pointer. I attended the talk when Matthias gave it last week at Harvard, but I don’t think that one was videotaped.)
Update (11/11): A commenter named RaulGPS has offered yet another great observation that, while forehead-slappingly obvious in retrospect, somehow hadn’t occurred to us. Namely, Raul points out that the argument given in this post, for the hardness of Scattershot BosonSampling, can also be applied to answer open question #4 from my and Alex’s paper: namely, how hard is BosonSampling with Gaussian inputs and number-resolving detectors? Raul points out that the latter, in general, is certainly at least as hard as Scattershot BS. For we can embed Scattershot BS into “ordinary” BS with Gaussian inputs, by first generating a bunch of entangled 2-mode Gaussian states (which are highly attenuated, so that with high probability none of them have 2 or more photons per mode), and then applying a Haar-random unitary U to the “right halves” of these Gaussian states while doing nothing to the left halves. Then we can measure the left halves to find out which of the input states contained a photon before we applied U. This is precisely equivalent to Scattershot BS, except for the unimportant detail that our measurement of the “herald” photons has been deferred till the end of the experiment instead of happening at the beginning. And therefore, since (as I explain in the post) a fast classical algorithm for approximate Scattershot BosonSampling would let us estimate the permanents of i.i.d. Gaussian matrices in BPPNP, we deduce that a fast classical algorithm for approximate Gaussian BosonSampling would have the same consequence. In short, approximate Gaussian BS can be argued to be hard under precisely the same complexity assumption as can approximate ordinary BS (and approximate Scattershot BS). Thus, in the table in Section 1.4 of our paper, the entries “Gaussian states / Adaptive, demolition” and “Gaussian states / Adaptive, nondemolition” should be “upgraded” from “Exact sampling hard” to “Apx. sampling hard?”
One other announcement: following a suggestion by commenter Rahul, I hereby invite guest posts on Shtetl-Optimized by experimentalists working on BosonSampling, offering your personal views about the prospects and difficulties of scaling up. Send me email if you’re interested. (Or if you don’t feel like writing a full post, of course you can also just leave a comment on this one.)
[Those impatient for a cool, obvious-in-retrospect new idea about BosonSampling, which I learned from the quantum optics group at Oxford, should scroll to the end of this post. Those who don’t even know what BosonSampling is, let alone Scattershot BosonSampling, should start at the beginning.]
BosonSampling is a proposal by me and Alex Arkhipov for a rudimentary kind of quantum computer: one that would be based entirely on generating single photons, sending them through a network of beamsplitters and phaseshifters, and then measuring where they ended up. BosonSampling devices are not thought to be capable of universal quantum computing, or even universal classical computing for that matter. And while they might be a stepping-stone toward universal optical quantum computers, they themselves have a grand total of zero known practical applications. However, even if the task performed by BosonSamplers is useless, the task is of some scientific interest, by virtue of apparently being hard! In particular, Alex and I showed that, if a BosonSampler can be simulated exactly in polynomial time by a classical computer, then P#P=BPPNP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Even if a BosonSampler can only be approximately simulated in classical polynomial time, the polynomial hierarchy would still collapse, if a reasonable-looking conjecture in classical complexity theory is true. For these reasons, BosonSampling might provide an experimental path to testing the Extended Church-Turing Thesis—i.e., the thesis that all natural processes can be simulated with polynomial overhead by a classical computer—that’s more “direct” than building a universal quantum computer. (As an asymptotic claim, obviously the ECT can never be decisively proved or refuted by a finite number of experiments. However, if one could build a BosonSampler with, let’s say, 30 photons, then while it would still be feasible to verify the results with a classical computer, it would be fair to say that the BosonSampler was working “faster” than any known algorithm running on existing digital computers.)
In arguing for the hardness of BosonSampling, the crucial fact Alex and I exploited is that the amplitudes for n-photon processes are given by the permanents of nxn matrices of complex numbers, and Leslie Valiant proved in 1979 that the permanent is #P-complete (i.e., as hard as any combinatorial counting problem, and probably even “harder” than NP-complete). To clarify, this doesn’t mean that a BosonSampler lets you calculate the permanent of a given matrix—that would be too good to be true! (See the tagline of this blog.) What you could do with a BosonSampler is weirder: you could sample from a probability distribution over matrices, in which matrices with large permanents are more likely to show up than matrices with small permanents. So, what Alex and I had to do was to argue that even that sampling task is still probably intractable classically—in the sense that, if it weren’t, then there would also be unlikely classical algorithms for more “conventional” problems.
Anyway, that’s my attempt at a 2-paragraph summary of something we’ve been thinking about on and off for four years. See here for my and Alex’s original paper on BosonSampling, here for a recent followup paper, here for PowerPoint slides, here and here for MIT News articles by Larry Hardesty, and here for my blog post about the first (very small, 3- or 4-photon) demonstrations of BosonSampling by quantum optics groups last year, with links to the four experimental papers that came out then.
In general, we’ve been thrilled by the enthusiastic reaction to BosonSampling by quantum optics people—especially given that the idea started out as pure complexity theory, with the connection to optics coming as an “unexpected bonus.” But not surprisingly, BosonSampling has also come in for its share of criticism: e.g., that it’s impractical, unscalable, trivial, useless, oversold, impossible to verify, and probably some other things. A few people have even claimed that, in expressing support and cautious optimism about the recent BosonSampling experiments, I’m guilty of the same sort of quantum computing hype that I complain about in others. (I’ll let you be the judge of that. Reread the paragraphs above, or anything else I’ve ever written about this topic, and then compare to, let’s say, this video.)
By far the most important criticism of BosonSampling—one that Alex and I have openly acknowledged and worried a lot about almost from the beginning—concerns the proposal’s scalability. The basic problem is this: in BosonSampling, your goal is to measure a pattern of quantum interference among n identical, non-interacting photons, where n is as large as possible. (The special case n=2 is called the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip; conversely, BosonSampling can be seen as just “Hong-Ou-Mandel on steroids.”) The bigger n gets, the harder the experiment ought to be to simulate using a classical computer (with the difficulty increasing at least like ~2n). The trouble is that, to detect interference among n photons, the various quantum-mechanical paths that your photons could take, from the sources, through the beamsplitter network, and finally to the detectors, have to get them there at exactly the same time—or at any rate, close enough to “the same time” that the wavepackets overlap. Yet, while that ought to be possible in theory, the photon sources that actually exist today, and that will exist for the foreseeable future, just don’t seem good enough to make it happen, for anything more than a few photons.
The reason—well-known for decades as a bane to quantum information experiments—is that there’s no known process in nature that can serve as a deterministic single-photon source. What you get from an attenuated laser is what’s called a coherent state: a particular kind of superposition of 0 photons, 1 photon, 2 photons, 3 photons, etc., rather than just 1 photon with certainty (the latter is called a Fock state). Alas, coherent states behave essentially like classical light, which makes them pretty much useless for BosonSampling, and for many other quantum information tasks besides. For that reason, a large fraction of modern quantum optics research relies on a process called Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC). In SPDC, a laser (called the “pump”) is used to stimulate a crystal to produce further photons. The process is inefficient: most of the time, no photon comes out. But crucially, any time a photon does come out, its arrival is “heralded” by a partner photon flying out in the opposite direction. Once in a while, 2 photons come out simultaneously, in which case they’re heralded by 2 partner photons—and even more rarely, 3 photons come out, heralded by 3 partner photons, and so on. Furthermore, there exists something called a number-resolving detector, which can tell you (today, sometimes, with as good as ~95% reliability) when one or more partner photons have arrived, and how many of them there are. The result is that SPDC lets us build what’s called a nondeterministic single-photon source. I.e., you can’t control exactly when a photon comes out—that’s random—but eventually one (and only one) photon will come out, and when that happens, you’ll know it happened, without even having to measure and destroy the precious photon. The reason you’ll know is that the partner photon heralds its presence.
Alas, while SPDC sources have enabled demonstrations of a large number of cool quantum effects, there’s a fundamental problem with using them for BosonSampling. The problem comes from the requirement that n—the number of single photons fired off simultaneously into your beamsplitter network—should be big (say, 20 or 30). Suppose that, in a given instant, the probability that your SPDC source succeeds in generating a photon is p. Then what’s the probability that two SPDC sources will both succeed in generating a photon at that instant? p2. And the probability that three sources will succeed is p3, etc. In general, with n sources, the probability that they’ll succeed simultaneously falls off exponentially with n, and the amount of time you’ll need to sit in the lab waiting for the lucky event increases exponentially with n. Sure, when it finally does happen, it will be “heralded.” But if you need to wait exponential time for it to happen, then there would seem to be no advantage over classical computation. This is the reason why so far, BosonSampling has only been demonstrated with 3-4 photons.
At least three solutions to the scaling problem suggest themselves, but each one has problems of its own. The first solution is simply to use general methods for quantum fault-tolerance: it’s not hard to see that, if you had a fault-tolerant universal quantum computer, then you could simulate BosonSampling with as many photons as you wanted. The trouble is that this requires a fault-tolerant universal quantum computer! And if you had that, then you’d probably just skip BosonSampling and use Shor’s algorithm to factor some 10,000-digit numbers. The second solution is to invent some specialized fault-tolerance method that would apply directly to quantum optics. Unfortunately, we don’t know how to do that. The third solution—until recently, the one that interested me and Alex the most—would be to argue that, even if your sources are so cruddy that you have no idea which ones generated a photon and which didn’t in any particular run, the BosonSampling distribution is still intractable to simulate classically. After all, the great advantage of BosonSampling is that, unlike with (say) factoring or quantum simulation, we don’t actually care which problem we’re solving! All we care about is that we’re doing something that we can argue is hard for classical computers. And we have enormous leeway to change what that “something” is, to match the capabilities of current technology. Alas, yet again, we don’t know how to argue that BosonSampling is hard to simulate approximately in the presence of realistic amounts of noise—at best, we can argue that it’s hard to simulate approximately in the presence of tiny amounts of noise, and hard to simulate super-accurately in the presence of realistic noise.
When faced with these problems, until recently, all we could do was
- shrug our shoulders,
- point out that none of the difficulties added up to a principled argument that scalable BosonSampling was not possible,
- stress, again, that all we were asking for was to scale to 20 or 30 photons, not 100 or 1000 photons, and
- express hope that technologies for single-photon generation currently on the drawing board—most notably, something called “optical multiplexing”—could be used to get up to the 20 or 30 photons we wanted.
Well, I’m pleased to announce, with this post, that there’s now a better idea for how to scale BosonSampling to interesting numbers of photons. The idea, which I’ve taken to calling Scattershot BosonSampling, is not mine or Alex’s. I learned of it from Ian Walmsley’s group at Oxford, where it’s been championed in particular by Steve Kolthammer. (Update: A commenter has pointed me to a preprint by Lund, Rahimi-Keshari, and Ralph from May of this year, which I hadn’t seen before, and which contains substantially the same idea, albeit with an unsatisfactory argument for computational hardness. In any case, as you’ll see, it’s not surprising that this idea would’ve occurred to multiple groups of experimentalists independently; what’s surprising is that we didn’t think of it!) The minute I heard about Scattershot BS, I kicked myself for failing to think of it, and for getting sidetracked by much more complicated ideas. Steve and others are working on a paper about Scattershot BS, but in the meantime, Steve has generously given me permission to share the idea on this blog. I suggested a blog post for two reasons: first, as you’ll see, this idea really is “blog-sized.” Once you make the observation, there’s barely any theoretical analysis that needs to be done! And second, I was impatient to get out to the “experimental BosonSampling community”—not to mention to the critics!—that there’s now a better way to BosonSample, and one that’s incredibly simple to boot.
OK, so what is the idea? Well, recall from above what an SPDC source does: it produces a photon with only a small probability, but whenever it does, it “heralds” the event with a second photon. So, let’s imagine that you have an array of 200 SPDC sources. And imagine that, these sources being unpredictable, only (say) 10 of them, on average, produce a photon at any given time. Then what can you do? Simple: just define those 10 sources to be the inputs to your experiment! Or to say it more carefully: instead of sampling only from a probability distribution over output configurations of your n photons, now you’ll sample from a joint distribution over inputs and outputs: one where the input is uniformly random, and the output depends on the input (and also, of course, on the beamsplitter network). So, this idea could also be called “Double BosonSampling”: now, not only do you not control which output will be observed (but only the probability distribution over outputs), you don’t control which input either—yet this lack of control is not a problem! There are two key reasons why it isn’t:
- As I said before, SPDC sources have the crucial property that they herald a photon when they produce one. So, even though you can’t control which 10 or so of your 200 SPDC sources will produce a photon in any given run, you know which 10 they were.
- In my and Alex’s original paper, the “hardest” case of BosonSampling that we were able to find—the case we used for our hardness reductions—is simply the one where the mxn “scattering matrix,” which describes the map between the n input modes and the m>>n output modes, is a Haar-random matrix whose columns are orthonormal vectors. But now suppose we have m input modes and m output modes, and the mxm unitary matrix U mapping inputs to outputs is Haar-random. Then any mxn submatrix of U will simply be an instance of the “original” hard case that Alex and I studied!
More formally, what can we say about the computational complexity of Scattershot BS? Admittedly, I don’t know of a reduction from ordinary BS to Scattershot BS (though it’s easy to give a reduction in the other direction). However, under exactly the same assumption that Alex and I used to argue that ordinary BosonSampling was hard—our so-called Permanent of Gaussians Conjecture (PGC)—one can show that Scattershot BS is hard also, and by essentially the same proof. The only difference is that, instead of talking about the permanents of nxn submatrices of an mxn Haar-random, column-orthonormal matrix, now we talk about the permanents of nxn submatrices of an mxm Haar-random unitary matrix. Or to put it differently: where before we fixed the columns that defined our nxn submatrix and only varied the rows, now we vary both the rows and the columns. But the resulting nxn submatrix is still close in variation distance to a matrix of i.i.d. Gaussians, for exactly the same reasons it was before. And we can still check whether submatrices with large permanents are more likely to be sampled than submatrices with small permanents, in the way predicted by quantum mechanics.
Now, everything above assumed that each SPDC source produces either 0 or 1 photon. But what happens when the SPDC sources produce 2 or more photons, as they sometimes do? It turns out that there are two good ways to deal with these “higher-order terms” in the context of Scattershot BS. The first way is by using number-resolving detectors to count how many herald photons each SPDC source produces. That way, at least you’ll know exactly which sources produced extra photons, and how many extra photons each one produced. And, as is often the case in BosonSampling, a devil you know is a devil you can deal with. In particular, a few known sources producing extra photons, just means that the amplitudes of the output configurations will now be permanents of matrices with a few repeated rows in them. But the permanent of an otherwise-random matrix with a few repeated rows should still be hard to compute! Granted, we don’t know how to derive that as a consequence of our original hardness assumption, but this seems like a case where one is perfectly justified to stick one’s neck out and make a new assumption.
But there’s also a more elegant way to deal with higher-order terms. Namely, suppose m>>n2 (i.e., the number of input modes is at least quadratically greater than the average number of photons). That’s an assumption that Alex and I typically made anyway in our original BosonSampling paper, because of our desire to avoid what we called the “Bosonic Birthday Paradox” (i.e., the situation where two or more photons congregate in the same output mode). What’s wonderful is that exactly the same assumption also implies that, in Scattershot BS, two or more photons will almost never be found in the same input mode! That is, when you do the calculation, you find that, once you’ve attenuated your SPDC sources enough to avoid the Bosonic Birthday Paradox at the output modes, you’ve also attenuated them enough to avoid higher-order terms at the input modes. Cool, huh?
Are there any drawbacks to Scattershot BS? Well, Scattershot BS certainly requires more SPDC sources than ordinary BosonSampling does, for the same average number of photons. A little less obviously, Scattershot BS also requires a larger-depth beamsplitter network. In our original paper, Alex and I showed that for ordinary BosonSampling, it suffices to use a beamsplitter network of depth O(n log m), where n is the number of photons and m is the number of output modes (or equivalently detectors). However, our construction took advantage of the fact that we knew exactly which n<<m sources the photons were going to come from, and could therefore optimize for those. For Scattershot BS, the depth bound increases to O(m log m): since the n photons could come from any possible subset of the m input modes, we no longer get the savings based on knowing where they originate. But this seems like a relatively minor issue.
I don’t want to give the impression that Scattershot BS is a silver bullet that will immediately let us BosonSample with 30 photons. The most obvious limiting factor that remains is the efficiency of the photon detectors—both those used to detect the photons that have passed through the beamsplitter network, and those used to detect the herald photons. Because of detector inefficiencies, I’m told that, without further technological improvements (or theoretical ideas), it will still be quite hard to push Scattershot BS beyond about 10 photons. Still, as you might have noticed, 10 is greater than 4 (the current record)! And certainly, Scattershot BS itself—a simple, obvious-in-retrospect idea that was under our noses for years, and that immediately pushes forward the number of photons a BosonSampler can handle—should make us exceedingly reluctant to declare there can’t be any more such ideas, and that our current ignorance amounts to a proof of impossibility.",22090,"['173ff5bceb35f9bb7f1f5aee2de3c16b9f3fd24e5bb1e9518472621a488590d2', 'bd39e966a81ac99646001150276d08d252af520d7bdcf90dd86fcb9355376847', '2fa001299f18c27917397f1abc08eb81637abf2b333c0ba19f3751208e19b9a6', '7c7d80e96ea6eb991a59ec5727061b2c1bf55faf04368aa9e78d26fd76a5e3a6', 'fc3b98005132eabccf1abb5fdc974b6e3fa65f1025c4b64dc515642dd902cb2d', '804ced39eb37219d3de97e81741ae5800d2486e7c3b927924ced659c428e0a1f', 'bd340235f40f846f67524bd136918e7c9e4707ddd3cfa1a5d9409c337c11def4', 'c8fa162ddc1c6b5a1195681a050b42ede4aec0ef7aea6a5f28ad440b821e98ad', '6ba5bd8c917f2e080d21134fae15bcb6f5806cf8860cafddbedf722cb2fabbda', '687b89ab7857f6138b2dfe35f66417fefe40b5b5145065a8afa270b876dcbd74', '54733fc7d37b726b282871f1052e8e4ce76f9131abfe1f15a7c07b275659923b', '21fdcfc5669f85b7c13708139c582a3f477a9bc2ad497282603320e1b90017a7', 'f5eb9d3b32870033b73037b462ebb649ea6749a88aaec57ea2c22f9d9a6d24bd', '45fd2d2f05350ce0f8c01c737e44094dde3c619f9dabce98159bcd8cd3a62461', '119aa68c448dd6bb345e1f76a342991ded2f554df5523c1085dad85440284860', 'dc9b09f5e7e551d09bb61229810ae4fd103fac65138a5f5fda7846188049cf97', '121262f707623ec9962cf8877d63a050f4dd33692fa0296e0dda81b86c54c8c4', '9c8929ba08df4256da0768e45f072341309a7f7a0e015503454fb0106710bf9c', '32fcad963df2957e1b3e5519166e7664b1f8b27cc81fd225253a47dc9e38ace6', '6caa7b134cdd8c43d59bf7c4a3897d678e48b2b6cf6fca51fc87ebdf831d161e', '34cacfbaf8d9327f3ff056edf0d0b8bcb5b721a5913a95aebf893e6de97cd584', 'b5ac808970cf0cadaf555a85fc617b165d660d53dc67a9f7c261fe7b725726b4', '0b9b45563cf91d49c276f06dfc339e07061fc1273e33758bb65f81b23d76e2f0', '1ea99e366e3f953d4f3baced86d7cbd6899c64f2a2ac51a3e5a4f27ab7d37738', '8d3d6de39ad0e9352d8b4bc374c0879682ce97c96a82e62b33336aead146b3ed', '703f0215664e87bd7fc5e9e5553158ce9679914db7d7a9f2118cb755e516d979', 'b6112394930221ab2921cc07fcd829f84f9826b026addc7ce88247e9c987d199', 'a9874ee4037f9b9a04badd54c1c2ef9b99a87c1272eae23d096797b611144ea8', '162ab0f6c1bf6fb69a552ad4c93aabfd864959aebea0b2a72c6a24daee0bd722', '1e1c3b82bb06e2c972413b469063cd9520c2af4b11fb12a294825e4b66184fd8', 'bd3eed62709d8447c6c67b1fb98d881c42df4e7e17af2ce0df524509e061cb60', 'b5ba73d74c84aff50fcdc882d4711ef6e9dca645261bcd0a4c09cb1c5e684faa', '7976520d8b1c70f2957656af940788ae0261f1015ef4d899e7d5f73e5bdb9431', '335ab06714cf8011fdd43549af3e0ec163cbcdcb9e3898a4e0647fe3625f5577', '50bb807f73ee83ccaf5e4f34dd82abe6af8c387734bc8990e23a0c62920bb259', '349b7e1d87352f2b627f61d96d68b73304984f682ec7635873245fb7e6ede11e', '37735ee6dd55c98c8f3a38685528daeefd637cfd71d7647fb3490c29ebbdd500', '4e96bc4ee3137549a5a2117a6b410a8b867fcab8d4d8e5e630c365d5068a9922', '6e32a57d8435b23b9f57bb0629335213ebdc1ba22c9737d381d2bfea7a7c7551', '980dd53e947717bb5b8f7909d67d68c11d706b90996c6520d191cf021c4ea60a', '6050a5fe4fa63b23a1cb6f1294d3d388647d3874e53f2ce3800f453eab5e4f89', 'e88aaf5d4da962f6452e5c310a2e6b353df2374c6aba194b37c1e0fca191c9ee', 'e24e2597e9ba75353ebf2eb2d4c6451c7f118995fc7a47342a0ea75c39265553', 'e18bdca05dbec6de842dfc013fc394b1ffccc2b70bb81ccbc793ddbcd4dc65bb', '3c5af8d78926c543ac4340c754c82d057d4dba03f0c3ce63e7d27c785dee875e', 'd4f85ed972747d83845734b572b0cfa5229d5b6869bedd55fcb0fd652e8a6caa', '9c6f0aeeb0c21198d05457f723fc14c365bf45c135ae737d82910746ce8b792e', '061045cb88a6d1aec49f4ffa724a02b212799365bd5c1fcd87178e4822de3e0d', '09f020a435807dc35b68ab1d7fcb9c0d46ed2c595ac01cc60fc7d61752cca740', 'e2afe0ca5852fed44967ea7bee767bfe18294030a917580943bd84998f4da89c', '6997675f760ffa6f3317c7c52a944c269b2256e0fdff35b2c83a1bdc9a78d410', 'ed75d0da6708cae8027664afce29e12ab93a904ade395d9631522aed96c9f237', 'aef9940806aa9b2100d78cafda8c896a3f8bb271f4c23c7ed161a5122a3dc75b', '3b42206b9c44eb702af2d3eb54586324c662b7370cd8fa57310bc0c48e3e9b67', '851b668ca54436373dda037f4aee9994949a0b656295f6d9331c4ff27b0ca1b3']"
173,1537,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1537,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2013-09-20,Scott Aaronson,The Unitarihedron: The Jewel at the Heart of Quantum Computing,"Update (9/24): This parody post was a little like a belch: I felt it build up in me as I read about the topic, I let it out, it was easy and amusing, I don’t feel any profound guilt over it—but on the other hand, not one of the crowning achievements of my career. As several commenters correctly pointed out, it may be true that, mostly because of the name and other superficialities, and because of ill-founded speculations about “the death of locality and unitarity,” the amplituhedron work is currently inspiring a flood of cringe-inducing misstatements on the web. But, even if true, still the much more interesting questions are what’s actually going on, and whether or not there are nontrivial connections to computational complexity.
Here I have good news: if nothing else, my “belch” of a post at least attracted some knowledgeable commenters to contribute excellent questions and insights, which have increased my own understanding of the subject from ε2 to ε. See especially this superb comment by David Speyer—which, among other things, pointed me to a phenomenal quasi-textbook on this subject by Elvang and Huang. My most immediate thoughts:
- The “amplituhedron” is only the latest in a long line of research over the last decade—Witten, Turing biographer Andrew Hodges, and many others have been important players—on how to compute scattering amplitudes more efficiently than by summing zillions of Feynman diagrams. One of the key ideas is to find combinatorial formulas that express complicated scattering amplitudes recursively in terms of simpler ones.
- This subject seems to be begging for a computational complexity perspective. When I read Elvang and Huang, I felt like they were working hard not to say anything about complexity: discussing the gains in efficiency from the various techniques they consider in informal language, or in terms of concrete numbers of terms that need to be summed for 1 loop, 2 loops, etc., but never in terms of asymptotics. So if it hasn’t been done already, it looks like it could be a wonderful project for someone just to translate what’s already known in this subject into complexity language.
- On reading about all these “modern” approaches to scattering amplitudes, one of my first reactions was to feel slightly less guilty about never having learned how to calculate Feynman diagrams! For, optimistically, it looks like some of that headache-inducing machinery (ghosts, off-shell particles, etc.) might be getting less relevant anyway—there being ways to calculate some of the same things that are not only more conceptually satisfying but also faster.
Many readers of this blog probably already saw Natalie Wolchover’s Quanta article “A Jewel at the Heart of Quantum Physics,” which discusses the “amplituhedron”: a mathematical structure that IAS physicist Nima Arkami-Hamed and his collaborators have recently been investigating. (See also here for Slashdot commentary, here for Lubos’s take, here for Peter Woit’s, here for a Physics StackExchange thread, here for Q&A with Pacific Standard, and here for an earlier but closely-related 154-page paper.)
At first glance, the amplituhedron appears to be a way to calculate scattering amplitudes, in the planar limit of a certain mathematically-interesting (but, so far, physically-unrealistic) supersymmetric quantum field theory, much more efficiently than by summing thousands of Feynman diagrams. In which case, you might say: “wow, this sounds like a genuinely-important advance for certain parts of mathematical physics! I’d love to understand it better. But, given the restricted class of theories it currently applies to, it does seem a bit premature to declare this to be a ‘jewel’ that unlocks all of physics, or a death-knell for spacetime, locality, and unitarity, etc. etc.”
Yet you’d be wrong: it isn’t premature at all. If anything, the popular articles have understated the revolutionary importance of the amplituhedron. And the reason I can tell you that with such certainty is that, for several years, my colleagues and I have been investigating a mathematical structure that contains the amplituhedron, yet is even richer and more remarkable. I call this structure the “unitarihedron.”
The unitarihedron encompasses, within a single abstract “jewel,” all the computations that can ever be feasibly performed by means of unitary transformations, the central operation in quantum mechanics (hence the name). Mathematically, the unitarihedron is an infinite discrete space: more precisely, it’s an infinite collection of infinite sets, which collection can be organized (as can every set that it contains!) in a recursive, fractal structure. Remarkably, each and every specific problem that quantum computers can solve—such as factoring large integers, discrete logarithms, and more—occurs as just a single element, or “facet” if you will, of this vast infinite jewel. By studying these facets, my colleagues and I have slowly pieced together a tentative picture of the elusive unitarihedron itself.
One of our greatest discoveries has been that the unitarihedron exhibits an astonishing degree of uniqueness. At first glance, different ways of building quantum computers—such as gate-based QC, adiabatic QC, topological QC, and measurement-based QC—might seem totally disconnected from each other. But today we know that all of those ways, and many others, are merely different “projections” of the same mysterious unitarihedron.
In fact, the longer I’ve spent studying the unitarihedron, the more awestruck I’ve been by its mathematical elegance and power. In some way that’s not yet fully understood, the unitarihedron “knows” so much that it’s even given us new insights about classical computing. For example, in 1991 Beigel, Reingold, and Spielman gave a 20-page proof of a certain property of unbounded-error probabilistic polynomial-time. Yet, by recasting things in terms of the unitarihedron, I was able to give a direct, half-page proof of the same theorem. If you have any experience with mathematics, then you’ll know that that sort of thing never happens: if it does, it’s a sure sign that cosmic or even divine forces are at work.
But I haven’t even told you the most spectacular part of the story yet. While, to my knowledge, this hasn’t yet been rigorously proved, many lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the unitarihedron must encompass the amplituhedron as a special case. If so, then the amplituhedron could be seen as just a single sparkle on an infinitely greater jewel.
Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I should tell you that the unitarihedron is what used to be known as the complexity class BQP (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time). However, just like the Chinese gooseberry was successfully rebranded in the 1950s as the kiwifruit, and the Patagonian toothfish as the Chilean sea bass, so with this post, I’m hereby rebranding BQP as the unitarihedron. For I’ve realized that, when it comes to bowling over laypeople, inscrutable complexity class acronyms are death—but the suffix “-hedron” is golden.
So, journalists and funders: if you’re interested in the unitarihedron, awesome! But be sure to also ask about my other research on the bosonsamplinghedron and the quantum-money-hedron. (Though, in recent months, my research has focused even more on the diaperhedron: a multidimensional, topologically-nontrivial manifold rich enough to encompass all wastes that an 8-month-old human could possibly emit. Well, at least to first-order approximation.)",7531,"['b44ec6db0298b8a273ffa092b02c32e6c21f286d675bbaaf60c18815ad61a284', 'a85a3892035937f55350fea607401d88086fc14adb19d7e695158f3c0c273b44',

174,1471,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1471,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2013-07-20,Scott Aaronson,Microsoft: From QDOS to QMA in less than 35 years,"This past week I was in Redmond for the Microsoft Faculty Summit, which this year included a special session on quantum computing. (Bill Gates was also there, I assume as our warmup act.) I should explain that Microsoft Research now has not one but two quantum computing research groups: there’s Station Q in Santa Barbara, directed by Michael Freedman, which pursues topological quantum computing, but there’s also QuArC in Redmond, directed by Krysta Svore, which studies things like quantum circuit synthesis.
Anyway, I’ve got two videos for your viewing pleasure:
- An interview about quantum computing with me, Krysta Svore, and Matthias Troyer, moderated by Chris Cashman, and filmed in a studio where they put makeup on your face. Just covers the basics.
- A session about quantum computing, with three speakers: me about “what quantum mechanics is good for” (quantum algorithms, money, crypto, and certified random numbers), then Charlie Marcus about physical implementations of quantum computing, and finally Matthias Troyer about his group’s experiments on the D-Wave machines. (You can also download my slides here.)
This visit really drove home for me that MSR is the closest thing that exists today to the old Bell Labs: a corporate lab that does a huge amount of openly-published, high-quality fundamental research in math and CS, possibly more than all the big Silicon-Valley-based companies combined. This research might or might not be good for Microsoft’s bottom line (Microsoft, of course, says that it is, and I’d like to believe them), but it’s definitely good for the world. With the news of Microsoft’s reorganization in the background, I found myself hoping that MS will remain viable for a long time to come, if only because its decline would leave a pretty gaping hole in computer science research.
Unfortunately, last week I also bought a new laptop, and had the experience of PowerPoint 2013 first refusing to install (it mistakenly thought it was already installed), then crashing twice and losing my data, and just generally making everything (even saving a file) harder than it used to be for no apparent reason. Yes, that’s correct: the preparations for my talk at the Microsoft Faculty Summit were repeatedly placed in jeopardy by the “new and improved” Microsoft Office.

175,1458,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1458,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2013-07-08,Scott Aaronson,The Collision Lower Bound After 12 Years,"Streaming video is now available for the talks at the QStart conference, a couple weeks ago at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. If you’re the sort of person who likes watching quantum information talks, then check out the excellent ones by Ray Laflamme, John Martinis, Umesh Vazirani, Thomas Vidick, Jacob Bekenstein, and many others.
My own contribution—the first “backwards-facing, crusty, retrospective” talk I’ve ever given—was called The Collision Lower Bound After 12 Years (click here for the slides—and to answer the inevitable question, no, I have no idea how to open PowerPoint files in your favorite free-range, organic computing platform). Briefly, the collision lower bound is the theorem that even a quantum computer needs at least ~n1/3 steps to find a duplicate in a long list of random numbers between 1 and n, even assuming the list is long enough that there are many, many duplicates to be found. (Moreover, ~n1/3 steps are known to suffice, by the BHT algorithm, a clever adaptation of Grover’s search algorithm. Also, for simplicity a “step” means a single access to the list, though of course a quantum algorithm can access multiple list elements in superposition and it still counts as one step.)
By comparison, for classical algorithms, ~√n steps are necessary and sufficient to find a collision, by the famous Birthday Paradox. So, just like for Grover’s search problem, a quantum computer could give you a modest speedup over classical for the collision problem, but only a modest one. The reason this is interesting is that, because of the abundance of collisions to be found, the collision problem has a great deal more structure than Grover’s search problem (though it has less structure than Shor’s period-finding problem, where there famously is an exponential quantum speedup).
One “obvious” motivation for the collision problem is that it models the problem of breaking collision-resistant hash functions (like SHA-256) in cryptography. In particular, if there were a superfast (e.g., log(n)-time) quantum algorithm for the collision problem, then there could be no CRHFs secure against quantum attack. So the fact that there’s no such algorithm at least opens up the possibility of quantum-secure CRHFs. However, there are many other motivations. For example, the collision lower bound rules out the most “simpleminded” approach to a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for the Graph Isomorphism problem (though, I hasten to add, it says nothing about more sophisticated approaches). The collision problem is also closely related to Statistical Zero Knowledge (SZK) proof protocols, so that the collision lower bound leads to an oracle relative to which SZK is not in BQP.
Probably the most bizarre motivation to other people, but for some reason the most important one to me back in 2001, is that the collision problem is closely related to the problem of sampling the entire trajectories of hidden variables, in hidden-variable theories such as Bohmian mechanics. The collision lower bound provides strong evidence that this trajectory-sampling problem is hard even for a quantum computer—intuitively because a QC can’t keep track of the correlations between the hidden-variable positions at different times. The way I like to put it is that if, at the moment of your death, your entire life history flashed before you in an instant (and if a suitable hidden-variable theory were true, and if you’d performed an appropriate quantum interference experiment on your own brain during your life), then you really could solve the collision problem in only O(1) steps. Interestingly, you still might not be able to solve NP-complete problems—I don’t know! But you could at least do something that we think is hard for a quantum computer.
I proved the first collision lower bound in 2001 (actually, a week or so after the 9/11 attacks), after four months of sleepless nights and failed attempts. (Well actually, I only got the weaker lower bound of ~n1/5; the ~n1/3 was a subsequent improvement due to Yaoyun Shi. Before ~n1/5, no one could even rule out that a quantum computer could solve the collision problem with a constant number of steps (!!), independent of n—say, 4 steps.) It was the first thing I’d proved of any significance, and probably the most important thing I did while in grad school. I knew it was one of the favorite problems of my adviser, Umesh Vazirani, so I didn’t even tell Umesh I was working on it until I’d already spent the whole summer on it. I figured he’d think I was nuts.
Bonus Proof Explanation!
The technique that ultimately worked was the polynomial method, which was introduced to quantum computing four years prior in a seminal paper of Beals et al. In this technique, you first suppose by contradiction that a quantum algorithm exists to solve your problem that makes very few accesses to the input bits—say, T. Then you write out the quantum algorithm’s acceptance probability (e.g., the probability that the algorithm outputs “yes, I found what I was looking for”) as a multivariate polynomial p in the input bits. It’s not hard to prove that p has degree at most 2T, since the amplitudes in the quantum algorithm can be written as degree-T polynomials (each input access increases the degree by at most 1, and unitary transformations in between input accesses don’t increase the degree at all); then squaring the amplitudes to get probabilities doubles the degree. (This is the only part of the method that uses anything specific to quantum mechanics!)
Next, you choose some parameter k related to the problem of interest, and you let q(k) be the expectation of p(X) over all inputs X with the parameter equal to k. For example, with the collision problem, it turns out that the “right” choice to make is to set k=1 if each number appears exactly once in your input list, k=2 if each number appears exactly twice, k=3 if each number appears exactly three times, and so on. Then—here comes the “magic” part—you show that q(k) itself is a univariate polynomial in k, again of degree at most 2T. This magical step is called “symmetrization”; it can be traced at least as far back as the famous 1969 book Perceptrons by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert. In the case of the collision problem, I still have no explanation, 12 years later, for why symmetrization works: all I can say is that you do the calculation, and you cancel lots of things from both the numerator and the denominator, and what comes out at the end is a low-degree polynomial in k. (It’s precisely because I would never have predicted such a “zany coincidence,” that I had to stumble around in the dark for 4 months before I finally discovered by chance that the polynomial method worked.)
Anyway, after applying symmetrization, you’re left with a low-degree univariate polynomial q with some very interesting properties: for example, you need 0≤q(k)≤1 for positive integers k, since then q(k) represents an averaged probability that your quantum algorithm does something. You also need q(1) to be close to 0, since if k=1 then there no collisions to be found, and you need q(2) to be close to 1, since if k=2 then there are lots of collisions and you’d like your algorithm to find one. But now, you can appeal to a theorem of A. A. Markov from the 1890s, which implies that no low-degree polynomial exists with those properties! Hence your original efficient quantum algorithm can’t have existed either: indeed, you get a quantitative lower bound (a tight one, if you’re careful) on the number of input accesses your algorithm must have made. And that, modulo some nasty technicalities (e.g., what if k doesn’t evenly divide the size of your list?), is how the collision lower bound works.
So, in the first half of my QStart talk, I explain the collision lower bound and its original motivations (and a little about the proof, but no more than what I said above). Then in the second half, I survey lots of extensions and applications between 2002 and the present, as well as the many remaining open problems. For example, I discuss the tight lower bound of Ambainis et al. for the “index erasure” problem, Belovs’s proof of the element distinctness lower bound using the adversary method, and my and Ambainis’s generalization of the collision lower bound to arbitrary symmetric problems. I also talk about Mark Zhandry’s recent breakthrough (sorry, am I not allowed to use that word?) showing that the GGM construction of pseudorandom functions is secure against quantum adversaries, and how Zhandry’s result can be seen—in retrospect, anyway—as yet another application of the collision lower bound.
Probably of the most general interest, I discuss how Daniel Harlow and Patrick Hayden invoked the collision lower bound in their striking recent paper on the AMPS black hole “firewall” paradox. In particular they argued that, in order to uncover the apparent violation of local quantum field theory at the heart of the paradox, an observer falling into a black hole would probably need to solve a QSZK-complete computational problem. And of course, the collision lower bound furnishes our main piece of evidence that QSZK-complete problems really should require exponential time even for quantum computers. So, Harlow and Hayden argue, the black hole would already have evaporated before the observer had even made a dent in the requisite computation.
Now, the Harlow-Hayden paper, and the AMPS paradox more generally, really deserve posts of their own—just as soon as I learn enough to decide what I think about them. For now, I’ll simply say that, regardless of how convinced you are by Harlow and Hayden’s argument (and, a bit like with my free-will essay, it’s not clear how convinced the authors themselves are!), it’s one of the most ambitious syntheses of computational complexity and physics I’ve ever seen. You can disagree with it, but to read the paper (or watch the talk, streaming video from Strings’2013 here) is to experience the thrill of seeing black hole physics related to complexity theory by authors who really know both.
(In my own talk on the collision lower bound, the short segment about Harlow-Hayden generated more questions and discussion than the rest of the talk combined—with me being challenged to defend their argument, even with Patrick Hayden right there in the audience! I remarked later that that portion of the talk was itself a black hole for audience interest.)

176,1400,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1400,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2013-05-16,Scott Aaronson,D-Wave: Truth finally starts to emerge,"Wrap-Up (June 5): This will be my final update on this post (really!!), since the discussion seems to have reached a point where not much progress is being made, and since I’d like to oblige the commenters who’ve asked me to change the subject. Let me try to summarize the main point I’ve been trying to get across this whole time. I’ll call the point (*).
(*) D-Wave founder Geordie Rose claims that D-Wave has now accomplished its goal of building a quantum computer that, in his words, is “better at something than any other option available.” This claim has been widely and uncritically repeated in the press, so that much of the nerd world now accepts it as fact. However, the claim is not supported by the evidence currently available. It appears that, while the D-Wave machine does outperform certain off-the-shelf solvers, simulated annealing codes have been written that outperform the D-Wave machine on its own native problem when run on a standard laptop. More research is needed to clarify the issue, but in the meantime, it seems worth knowing that this is where things currently stand.
In the comments, many people tried repeatedly to change the subject from (*) to various subsidiary questions. For example: isn’t it possible that D-Wave’s current device will be found to provide a speedup on some other distribution of instances, besides the one that was tested? Even if not, isn’t it possible that D-Wave will achieve a genuine speedup with some future generation of machines? Did it make business sense for Google to buy a D-Wave machine? What were Google’s likely reasons? What’s D-Wave’s current value as a company? Should Cathy McGeoch have acted differently, in the type of comparison she agreed to do, or in how she communicated about its results? Should I have acted differently, in my interaction with McGeoch?
And, I’m afraid to say, I jumped in to the discussion of all of those questions—because, let’s face it, there are very few subjects about which I don’t have an opinion, or at least a list of qualified observations to make. In retrospect, I now think that was a mistake. It would have been better to sidestep all the other questions—not one of which I really know the answer to, and each of which admits multiple valid perspectives—and just focus relentlessly on the truth of assertion (*).
Here’s an analogy: imagine that a biotech startup claimed that, by using an expensive and controversial new gene therapy, it could cure patients at a higher rate than with the best available conventional drugs—basing its claim on a single clinical trial. Imagine that this claim was widely repeated in the press as an established fact. Now imagine that closer examination of the clinical trial revealed that it showed nothing of the kind: it compared against the wrong drugs. And imagine that a more relevant clinical trial—mostly unmentioned in the press—had also been done, and discovered that when you compare to the right drugs, the drugs do better. Imagine that someone wrote a blog post bringing all of this to public attention.
And now imagine that the response to that blogger was the following: “aha, but isn’t it possible that some future clinical trial will show an advantage for the gene therapy—maybe with some other group of patients? Even if not, isn’t it possible that the startup will manage to develop an effective gene therapy sometime in the future? Betcha didn’t consider that, did you? And anyway, at least they’re out there trying to make gene therapy work! So we should all support them, rather than relentlessly criticizing. And as for the startup’s misleading claims to the public? Oh, don’t be so naïve: that’s just PR. If you can’t tune out the PR and concentrate on the science, that’s your own damn problem. In summary, the real issue isn’t what some clinical trial did or didn’t show; it’s you and your hostile attitude.”
In a different context, these sorts of responses would be considered strange, and the need to resort to them revealing. But the rules for D-Wave are different.
(Interestingly, in excusing D-Wave’s statements, some commenters explicitly defended standards of intellectual discourse so relaxed that, as far as I could tell, just about anything anyone could possibly say would be OK with them—except of course for what I say on this blog, which is not OK! It reminds me of the central tenet of cultural relativism: that there exist no universal standards by which any culture could ever be judged “good” or “bad,” except that Western culture is irredeemably evil.)
Update (June 4): Matthias Troyer (who, unfortunately, still can’t comment here for embargo reasons) has asked me to clarify that it’s not he, but rather his postdoc Sergei Isakov, who deserves the credit for actually writing the simulated annealing code that outperformed the D-Wave machine on the latter’s own “home turf” (i.e., random QUBO instances with the D-Wave constraint graph). The quantum Monte Carlo code, which also did quite well at simulating the D-Wave machine, was written by Isakov together with another of Matthias’s postdocs, Troels Rønnow.
Yet More Updates (June 2): Alex Selby has a detailed new post summarizing his comparisons between the D-Wave device (as reported by McGeoch and Wang) and his own solver—finding that his solver can handily outperform the device and speculating about the reasons why.
In other news, Catherine McGeoch spoke on Friday in the MIT quantum group meeting. Incredibly, she spoke for more than an hour, without once mentioning the USC results that found that simulated annealing on a standard laptop (when competently implemented) handily outperformed the D-Wave machine, or making any attempt to reconcile those results with hers and Wang’s. Instead, McGeogh used the time to enlighten the assembled experts about what quantum annealing was, what an exact solver was, etc. etc., then repeated the speedup claims as if the more informative comparisons simply didn’t exist. I left without asking questions, not wanting to be the one to instigate an unpleasant confrontation, and—I’ll admit—questioning my own sanity as a result of no one else asking about the gigantic elephant in the room.
More Updates (May 21): Happy 25th birthday to me! Among the many interesting comments below, see especially this one by Alex Selby, who says he’s written his own specialist solver for one class of the McGeoch and Wang benchmarks that significantly outperforms the software (and D-Wave machine) tested by McGeoch and Wang on those benchmarks—and who provides the Python code so you can try it yourself.
Also, Igor Vernik asked me to announce that on July 8th, D-Wave will be giving a technical presentation at the International Superconducting Electronics Conference in Cambridge. See here for more info; I’ll be traveling then and won’t be able to make it. I don’t know whether the performance comparisons to Matthias Troyer’s and Alex Selby’s code will be among the topics discussed, or if there will be an opportunity to ask questions about such things.
In another exciting update, John Smolin and Graeme Smith posted a paper to the arXiv tonight questioning even the “signature of quantumness” part of the latest D-Wave claims—the part that I’d been ~98% willing to accept, even as I relayed evidence that cast enormous doubt on the “speedup” part. Specifically, Smolin and Smith propose a classical model that they say can explain the “bimodal” pattern of success probabilities observed by the USC group as well as quantum annealing can. I haven’t yet had time to read their paper or form an opinion about it, but I’d be very interested if others wanted to weigh in. Update (May 26): The USC group has put out a new preprint responding to Smolin and Smith, offering additional evidence for quantum behavior in the D-Wave device that they say can’t be explained using Smolin and Smith’s model.
Update (May 17): Daniel Lidar emailed me to clarify his views about error-correction and the viability of D-Wave’s approach. He invited me to share his clarification with others—something that I’m delighted to do, since I agree with him wholeheartedly. Without further ado, here’s what Lidar says:
I don’t believe D-Wave’s approach is scalable without error correction. I believe that the incorporation of error correction is a necessary condition in order to ever achieve a speedup with D-Wave’s machines, and I don’t believe D-Wave’s machines are any different from other types of quantum information processing in this regard. I have repeatedly made this point to D-Wave over several years, and I hope that in the future their designs will allow more flexibility in the incorporation of error correction.
Lidar also clarified that he not only doesn’t dispute what Matthias Troyer told me about the lack of speedup of the D-Wave device compared to classical simulated annealing in their experiments, but “fully agrees, endorses, and approves” of it—and indeed, that he himself was part of the team that did the comparison.
In other news, this Hacker News thread, which features clear, comprehending discussions of this blog post and the backstory that led up to it, has helped to restore my faith in humanity.
Two years ago almost to the day, I announced my retirement as Chief D-Wave Skeptic. But—as many readers predicted at the time—recent events (and the contents of my inbox!) have given me no choice except to resume my post. In an all-too-familiar pattern, multiple rounds of D-Wave-related hype have made it all over the world before the truth has had time to put its pants on and drop its daughter off in daycare. And the current hype is particularly a shame, because once one slices through all the layers of ugh—the rigged comparisons, the “dramatic announcements” that mean nothing, the lazy journalists cherry-picking what they want to hear and ignoring the inconvenient bits—there really has been a huge scientific advance this past month in characterizing the D-Wave devices. I’m speaking about the experiments on the D-Wave One installed at USC, the main results of which finally appeared in April. Two of the coauthors of this new work—Matthias Troyer and Daniel Lidar—were at MIT recently to speak about their results, Troyer last week and Lidar this Tuesday. Intriguingly, despite being coauthors on the same paper, Troyer and Lidar have very different interpretations of what their results mean, but we’ll get to that later. For now, let me summarize what I think their work has established.
Evidence for Quantum Annealing Behavior
For the first time, we have evidence that the D-Wave One is doing what should be described as “quantum annealing” rather than “classical annealing” on more than 100 qubits. (Note that D-Wave itself now speaks about “quantum annealing” rather than “quantum adiabatic optimization.” The difference between the two is that the adiabatic algorithm runs coherently, at zero temperature, while quantum annealing is a “messier” version in which the qubits are strongly coupled to their environment throughout, but still maintain some quantum coherence.) The evidence for quantum annealing behavior is still extremely indirect, but despite my “Chief Skeptic” role, I’m ready to accept what the evidence indicates with essentially no hesitation.
So what is the evidence? Basically, the USC group ran the D-Wave One on a large number of randomly generated instances of what I’ll call the “D-Wave problem”: namely, the problem of finding the lowest-energy configuration of an Ising spin glass, with nearest-neighbor interactions that correspond to the D-Wave chip’s particular topology. Of course, restricting attention to this “D-Wave problem” tilts the tables heavily in D-Wave’s favor, but no matter: scientifically, it makes a lot more sense than trying to encode Sudoku puzzles or something like that. Anyway, the group then looked at the distribution of success probabilities when each instance was repeatedly fed to the D-Wave machine. For example, would the randomly-generated instances fall into one giant clump, with a few outlying instances that were especially easy or especially hard for the machine? Surprisingly, they found that the answer was no: the pattern was strongly bimodal, with most instances either extremely easy or extremely hard, and few instances in between. Next, the group fed the same instances to Quantum Monte Carlo: a standard classical algorithm that uses Wick rotation to find the ground states of “stoquastic Hamiltonians,” the particular type of quantum evolution that the D-Wave machine is claimed to implement. When they did that, they found exactly the same bimodal pattern that they found with the D-Wave machine. Finally they fed the instances to a classical simulated annealing program—but there they found a “unimodal” distribution, not a bimodal one. So, their conclusion is that whatever the D-Wave machine is doing, it’s more similar to Quantum Monte Carlo than it is to classical simulated annealing.
Curiously, we don’t yet have any hint of a theoretical explanation for why Quantum Monte Carlo should give rise to a bimodal distribution, while classical simulating annealing should give rise to a unimodal one. The USC group simply observed the pattern empirically (as far as I know, they’re the first to do so), then took advantage of it to characterize the D-Wave machine. I regard explaining this pattern as an outstanding open problem raised by their work.
In any case, if we accept that the D-Wave One is doing “quantum annealing,” then despite the absence of a Bell-inequality violation or other direct evidence, it’s reasonably safe to infer that there should be large-scale entanglement in the device. I.e., the true quantum state is no doubt extremely mixed, but there’s no particular reason to believe we could decompose that state into a mixture of product states. For years, I tirelessly repeated that D-Wave hadn’t even provided evidence that its qubits were entangled—and that, while you can have entanglement with no quantum speedup, you can’t possibly have a quantum speedup without at least the capacity to generate entanglement. Now, I’d say, D-Wave finally has cleared the evidence-for-entanglement bar—and, while they’re not the first to do so with superconducting qubits, they’re certainly the first to do so with so many superconducting qubits. So I congratulate D-Wave on this accomplishment. If this had been advertised from the start as a scientific research project—“of course we’re a long way from QC being practical; no one would ever claim otherwise; but as a first step, we’ve shown experimentally that we can entangle 100 superconducting qubits with controllable couplings”—my reaction would’ve been, “cool!” (Similar to my reaction to any number of other steps toward scalable QC being reported by research groups all over the world.)
No Speedup Compared to Classical Simulated Annealing
But of course, D-Wave’s claims—and the claims being made on its behalf by the Hype-Industrial Complex—are far more aggressive than that. And so we come to the part of this post that has not been pre-approved by the International D-Wave Hype Repeaters Association. Namely, the same USC paper that reported the quantum annealing behavior of the D-Wave One, also showed no speed advantage whatsoever for quantum annealing over classical simulated annealing. In more detail, Matthias Troyer’s group spent a few months carefully studying the D-Wave problem—after which, they were able to write optimized simulated annealing code that solves the D-Wave problem on a normal, off-the-shelf classical computer, about 15 times faster than the D-Wave machine itself solves the D-Wave problem! Of course, if you wanted even more classical speedup than that, then you could simply add more processors to your classical computer, for only a tiny fraction of the ~$10 million that a D-Wave One would set you back.
Some people might claim it’s “unfair” to optimize the classical simulated annealing code to take advantage of the quirks of the D-Wave problem. But think about it this way: D-Wave has spent ~$100 million, and hundreds of person-years, optimizing the hell out of a special-purpose annealing device, with the sole aim of solving this one problem that D-Wave itself defined. So if we’re serious about comparing the results to a classical computer, isn’t it reasonable to have one professor and a few postdocs spend a few months optimizing the classical code as well?
As I said, besides simulated annealing, the USC group also compared the D-Wave One’s performance against a classical implementation of Quantum Monte Carlo. And maybe not surprisingly, the D-Wave machine was faster than a “direct classical simulation of itself” (I can’t remember how many times faster, and couldn’t find that information in the paper). But even here, there’s a delicious irony. The only reason the USC group was able to compare the D-Wave one against QMC at all, is that QMC is efficiently implementable on a classical computer! (Albeit probably with a large constant overhead compared to running the D-Wave annealer itself—hence the superior performance of classical simulated annealing over QMC.) This means that, if the D-Wave machine can be understood as reaching essentially the same results as QMC (technically, “QMC with no sign problem”), then there’s no real hope for using the D-Wave machine to get an asymptotic speedup over a classical computer. The race between the D-Wave machine and classical simulations of the machine would then necessarily be a cat-and-mouse game, a battle of constant factors with no clear asymptotic victor. (Some people might conjecture that it will also be a “Tom & Jerry game,” the kind where the classical mouse always gets the better of the quantum cat.)
At this point, it’s important to give a hearing to three possible counterarguments to what I’ve written above.
The first counterargument is that, if you plot both the runtime of simulated annealing and the runtime of the D-Wave machine as functions of the instance size n, you find that, while simulated annealing is faster in absolute terms, it can look like the curve for the D-Wave machine is less steep. Over on the blog “nextbigfuture”, an apparent trend of this kind has been fearlessly extrapolated to predict that with 512 qubits, the D-Wave machine will be 10 billion times faster than a classical computer. But there’s a tiny fly in the ointment. As Troyer carefully explained to me last week, the “slow growth rate” of the D-Wave machine’s runtime is, ironically, basically an artifact of the machine being run too slowly on small values of n. Run the D-Wave machine as fast as it can run for small n, and the difference in the slopes disappears, with only the constant-factor advantage for simulated annealing remaining. In short, there seems to be no evidence, at present, that the D-Wave machine is going to overtake simulated annealing for any instance size.
The second counterargument is that the correlation between the two “bimodal distributions”—that for the D-Wave machine and that for the Quantum Monte Carlo simulation—is not perfect. In other words, there are a few instances (not many) that QMC solves faster than the D-Wave machine, and likewise a few instances that the D-Wave machine solves faster than QMC. Not surprisingly, the latter fact has been eagerly seized on by the D-Wave boosters (“hey, sometimes the machine does better!”). But Troyer has a simple and hilarious response to that. Namely, he found that his group’s QMC code did a better job of correlating with the D-Wave machine, than the D-Wave machine did of correlating with itself! In other words, calibration errors seem entirely sufficient to explain the variation in performance, with no need to posit any special class of instances (however small) on which the D-Wave machine dramatically outperforms QMC.
The third counterargument is just the banal one: the USC experiment was only one experiment with one set of instances (albeit, a set one might have thought would be heavily biased toward D-Wave). There’s no proof that, in the future, it won’t be discovered that the D-Wave machine does something more than QMC, and that there’s some (perhaps specially-designed) set of instances on which the D-Wave machine asymptotically outperforms both QMC and Troyer’s simulated annealing code. (Indeed, I gather that folks at D-Wave are now assiduously looking for such instances.) Well, I concede that almost anything is possible in the future—but “these experiments, while not supporting D-Wave’s claims about the usefulness of its devices, also don’t conclusively disprove those claims” is a very different message than what’s currently making it into the press.
Comparison to CPLEX is Rigged
Unfortunately, the USC paper is not the one that’s gotten the most press attention—perhaps because half of it inconveniently told the hypesters something they didn’t want to hear (“no speedup”). Instead, journalists have preferred a paper released this week by Catherine McGeoch and Cong Wang, which reports that quantum annealing running on the D-Wave machine outperformed the CPLEX optimization package running on a classical computer by a factor of ~3600, on Ising spin problems involving 439 bits. Wow! That sounds awesome! But before rushing to press, let’s pause to ask ourselves: how can we reconcile this with the USC group’s result of no speedup?
The answer turns out to be painfully simple. CPLEX is a general-purpose, off-the-shelf exact optimization package. Of course an exact solver can’t compete against quantum annealing—or for that matter, against classical annealing or other classical heuristics! Noticing this problem, McGeoch and Wang do also compare the D-Wave machine against tabu search, a classical heuristic algorithm. When they do so, they find that an advantage for the D-Wave machine persists, but it becomes much, much smaller (they didn’t report the exact time comparison). Amusingly, they write in their “Conclusions and Future Work” section:
It would of course be interesting to see if highly tuned implementations of, say, tabu search or simulated annealing could compete with Blackbox or even QA [i.e., the D-Wave machines] on QUBO [quadratic binary optimization] problems; some preliminary work on this question is underway.
As I said above, at the time McGeoch and Wang’s paper was released to the media (though maybe not at the time it was written?), the “highly tuned implementation” of simulated annealing that they ask for had already been written and tested, and the result was that it outperformed the D-Wave machine on all instance sizes tested. In other words, their comparison to CPLEX had already been superseded by a much more informative comparison—one that gave the “opposite” result—before it ever became public. For obvious reasons, most press reports have simply ignored this fact.
Troyer, Lidar, and Stone Soup
Much of what I’ve written in this post, I learned by talking to Matthias Troyer—the man who carefully experimented with the D-Wave machine and figured out how to beat it using simulated annealing, and who I regard as probably the world’s #1 expert right now on what exactly the machine does. Troyer wasn’t shy about sharing his opinions, and while couched with qualifications, they tended toward extremely skeptical. For example, Troyer conjectured that, if D-Wave ultimately succeeds in getting a speedup over classical computers in a fair comparison, then it will probably be by improving coherence and calibration, incorporating error-correction, and doing other things that “traditional,” “academic” quantum computing researchers had said all along would need to be done.
As I said, Daniel Lidar is another coauthor on the USC paper, and also recently visited MIT to speak. Lidar and Troyer agree on the basic facts—yet Lidar noticeably differed from Troyer, in trying to give each fact the most “pro-D-Wave spin” it could possibly support. Lidar spoke at our quantum group meeting, not about the D-Wave vs. simulated annealing performance comparison (which he agrees with), but about a proposal of his for incorporating quantum error-correction into the D-Wave device, together with some experimental results. He presented his proposal, not as a reductio ad absurdum of D-Wave’s entire philosophy, but rather as a positive opportunity to get a quantum speedup using D-Wave’s approach.
So, to summarize my current assessment of the situation: yes, absolutely, D-Wave might someday succeed—ironically, by adapting the very ideas from “the gate model” that its entire business plan has been based on avoiding, and that D-Wave founder Geordie Rose has loudly denigrated for D-Wave’s entire history! If that’s what happens, then I predict that science writers, and blogs like “nextbigfuture,” will announce from megaphones that D-Wave has been vindicated at last, while its narrow-minded, theorem-obsessed, ivory-tower academic naysayers now have egg all over their faces. No one will care that the path to success—through quantum error-correction and so on—actually proved the academic critics right, and that D-Wave’s “vindication” was precisely like that of the deliciousness of stone soup in the old folktale. As for myself, I’ll probably bang my head on my desk until I sustain so much brain damage that I no longer care either. But at least I’ll still have tenure, and the world will have quantum computers.
The Messiah’s Quantum Annealer
Over the past few days, I’ve explained the above to at least six different journalists who asked. And I’ve repeatedly gotten a striking response: “What you say makes sense—but then why are all these prestigious people and companies investing in D-Wave? Why did Bo Ewald, a prominent Silicon Valley insider, recently join D-Wave as president of its US operations? Why the deal with Lockheed Martin? Why the huge deal with NASA and Google, just announced today? What’s your reaction to all this news?”
My reaction, I confess, is simple. I don’t care—I actually told them this—if the former Pope Benedict has ended his retirement to become D-Wave’s new marketing director. I don’t care if the Messiah has come to Earth on a flaming chariot, not to usher in an age of peace but simply to spend $10 million on D-Wave’s new Vesuvius chip. And if you imagine that I’ll ever care about such things, then you obviously don’t know much about me. I’ll tell you what: if peer pressure is where it’s at, then come to me with the news that Umesh Vazirani, or Greg Kuperberg, or Matthias Troyer is now convinced, based on the latest evidence, that D-Wave’s chip asymptotically outperforms simulated annealing in a fair comparison, and does so because of quantum effects. Any one such scientist’s considered opinion would mean more to me than 500,000 business deals.
The Argument from Consequences
Let me end this post with an argument that several of my friends in physics have explicitly made to me—not in the exact words below but in similar ones.
“Look, Scott, let the investors, government bureaucrats, and gullible laypeople believe whatever they want—and let D-Wave keep telling them whatever’s necessary to stay in business. It’s unsportsmanlike and uncollegial of you to hold D-Wave’s scientists accountable for whatever wild claims their company’s PR department might make. After all, we’re in this game too! Our universities put out all sorts of overhyped press releases, but we don’t complain because we know that it’s done for our benefit. Besides, you’d doubtless be trumpeting the same misleading claims, if you were in D-Wave’s shoes and needed the cash infusions to survive. Anyway, who really cares whether there’s a quantum speedup yet or no quantum speedup? At least D-Wave is out there trying to build a scalable quantum computer, and getting millions of dollars from Jeff Bezos, Lockheed, Google, the CIA, etc. etc. to do so—resources more of which would be directed our way if we showed a more cooperative attitude! If we care about scalable QCs ever getting built, then the wise course is to celebrate what D-Wave has done—they just demonstrated quantum annealing on 100 qubits, for crying out loud! So let’s all be grownups here, focus on the science, and ignore the marketing buzz as so much meaningless noise—just like a tennis player might ignore his opponent’s trash-talking (‘your mother is a whore,’ etc.) and focus on the game.”
I get this argument: really, I do. I even concede that there’s something to be said for it. But let me now offer a contrary argument for the reader’s consideration.
Suppose that, unlike in the “stone soup” scenario I outlined above, it eventually becomes clear that quantum annealing can be made to work on thousands of qubits, but that it’s a dead end as far as getting a quantum speedup is concerned. Suppose the evidence piles up that simulated annealing on a conventional computer will continue to beat quantum annealing, if even the slightest effort is put into optimizing the classical annealing code. If that happens, then I predict that the very same people now hyping D-Wave will turn around and—without the slightest acknowledgment of error on their part—declare that the entire field of quantum computing has now been unmasked as a mirage, a scam, and a chimera. The same pointy-haired bosses who now flock toward quantum computing, will flock away from it just as quickly and as uncomprehendingly. Academic QC programs will be decimated, despite the slow but genuine progress that they’d been making the entire time in a “parallel universe” from D-Wave. People’s contempt for academia is such that, while a D-Wave success would be trumpeted as its alone, a D-Wave failure would be blamed on the entire QC community.
When it comes down to it, that’s the reason why I care about this matter enough to have served as “Chief D-Wave Skeptic” from 2007 to 2011, and enough to resume my post today. As I’ve said many times, I really, genuinely hope that D-Wave succeeds at building a QC that achieves an unambiguous speedup! I even hope the academic QC community will contribute to D-Wave’s success, by doing careful independent studies like the USC group did, and by coming up with proposals like Lidar’s for how D-Wave could move forward. On the other hand, in the strange, unlikely event that D-Wave doesn’t succeed, I’d like people to know that many of us in the QC community were doing what academics are supposed to do, which is to be skeptical and not leave obvious questions unasked. I’d like them to know that some of us simply tried to understand and describe what we saw in front of us—changing our opinions repeatedly as new evidence came in, but disregarding “meta-arguments” like my physicist friends’ above. The reason I can joke about how easy it is to bribe me is that it’s actually kind of hard.",30831,"['363dd743d743efb0cf70d74292335a90895d0e0c8750ce454750dc6139a59550',

177,1359,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1359,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2013-05-01,Scott Aaronson,“Closer to Truth”,"Two years ago, when I attended the FQXi conference on a ship from Norway to Denmark, I (along with many other conference participants) was interviewed by Robert Lawrence Kuhn, who produces a late-night TV program called “Closer to Truth.” I’m pleased to announce (hat tip: Sean Carroll) that four videos from my interview are finally available online:
- Is the Universe a Computer?
- What Does Quantum Theory Mean?
- Quantum Computing Mysteries
- Setting Time Aright (about the differences between time and space, the P vs. PSPACE problem, and computing with closed timelike curves)
(like a politician, I steer the question toward “what kind of computer is the universe?,” then start talking about P vs. NP, quantum computing, and the holographic principle)
(here I mostly talk about the idea of computational intractability as a principle of physics)
(basics of quantum mechanics and quantum computing)
(No, I didn’t choose the titles!)
For regular readers of this blog, there’s probably nothing new in these videos, but for those who are “just tuning in,” they provide an extremely simple and concise introduction to what I care about and why. I’m pretty happy with how they came out.
Once you’re finished with me (or maybe even before then…), click here for the full list of interviewees, which includes David Albert, Raphael Bousso, Sean Carroll, David Deutsch, Rebecca Goldstein, Seth Lloyd, Marvin Minsky, Roger Penrose, Lenny Susskind, Steven Weinberg, and many, many others who might be of interest to Shtetl-Optimized readers.",1535,"['91b24c33915dfe1b321438020069909323947733fc8e1679e52e42c648c1c7b5', 'f12d1c140adff59867837ed4d3c527b641c906aca03ed5064f6220985a9cc36a', '1efea3011d30e98936c7046856ee9e846980c67164455eaff8047732ea1064ea', 'a5b634a2823f00ae3407451b28d925612028ddc8e11515b2be19cc702aa2e519', '4630f906402ab6652d471592a31850164a781ea58bbc1ded04a5870fa3038942', '60befdb4da6d175c008b5cc096e94ef1d317b2e08a7d3748cbc8a28ae855b8f3', 'b520dbcc1c31fd3d2196a7a97a4bb598a6f5c3c20b4fe17a44fbb4e21c2cdcca', '801153295b91b3df82d5de85fcca3c44c3101a9c44d0af051e53503192a38f70', '6bce994cd4d5004cc163e30b9fe854e461304e03b3fad3ea86713bafb05828d8', 'd41153c9f8da0add43511cc7f30d8bad343bc7aab076e5d4c0daf388bce781aa', 'a99b153e081e8854303c5392c3f669b1ffffd5ca4b4fa1211e8226ec82f5286c', 'b21a6bea960836d0eaa5e21cc1b68c0e6f75977b42a4c843d6d814c915b79965', '3c36386da9b8cfefdc1280324346e2a7843e3ffa5f9035f018b4feb9359c8fce', 'ae312e5749972a03bf6e8b1ed9f869ca917492360e32c8a81db8f0cf99265b01', 'e3f27f3e9106a262628f0192a8b540f16497384024c4ca1084a851e90829b14b', '891e10ad259bbe7f1b4a0d4ab26b34aad480d73a6fe848dc236d461322286fea', 'f226a6dfd63350b92701e11fadeb63b1a09a6b6ad5d93700054b8f1b86dd07f0']"
178,1345,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1345,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2013-04-26,Scott Aaronson,Superiority of the Latke: The Unexpected Convergence of Quantum Mechanics and Common Sense,"Back in February, I gave a talk with the above title at the Annual MIT Latke-Hamentaschen Debate. I’m pleased to announce that streaming video of my talk is now available! (My segment starts about 10 minutes into the video, and lasts for 10 minutes.) You can also download my PowerPoint slides here.
Out of hundreds of talks I’ve given in my life, on five continents, this is the single talk of which I’m the proudest.
Of course, before you form an opinion about the issue at hand, you should also check out the contributions of my fellow debaters. On the sadly-mistaken hamentasch side, my favorite presentation was that of mathematician Arthur Mattuck, which starts in at 56 minutes and lasts for a full half hour (!! – the allotted time was only 8 minutes). Mattuck relates the shapes of latkes and hamentaschen to the famous Kakeya problem in measure theory—though strangely, his final conclusions seem to provide no support whatsoever for the hamentaschen, even on Mattuck’s own terms.
Finally, what if you’re a reader for whom the very words “latke” and “hamentaschen” are just as incomprehensible as the title of this blog? OK, here are some Cliff Notes:
- Latkes are fried potato pancakes, traditionally eaten by Jews on Hannukah.
- Hamentaschen are triangular fruit-filled cookies, traditionally eaten by Jews on Purim.
- Beginning at the University of Chicago in 1946, many universities around the world have held farcical annual “debates” between faculty members (both Jewish and non-Jewish) about which of those two foods is better. (The reason I say “farcical” is simply that, as I explain in my talk, the truth has always been overwhelmingly on one side.) The debaters have invoked everything from feminist theory to particle physics to bolster their case.

181,1277,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1277,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2013-03-22,Scott Aaronson,Quantum Computing Since Democritus: The Buzz Intensifies,"Update (March 22): The Kindle edition of Quantum Computing Since Democritus is now available, for the low price of $15.40! (Not factorial.) Click here to get it from amazon.com, or here to get it from amazon.co.uk.
And let me know how it looks (I haven’t seen it yet). Another Update: Just saw the Kindle edition, and the figures and formulas came out great! It’s a product I stand behind with pride.
In the meantime, I regret to say that the marketing for this book is getting crasser and more exploitative by the day.
It seems like wherever I go these days, all anyone wants to talk about is Quantum Computing Since Democritus—the sprawling new book by Scott Aaronson, published by Cambridge University Press and available for order now. Among leading figures in quantum information science—many of them well-known to Shtetl-Optimized readers—the book is garnering the sort of hyperbolic praise that would make Shakespeare or Tolstoy blush:
“I laughed, I cried, I fell off my chair – and that was just reading the chapter on Computational Complexity. Aaronson is a tornado of intellectual activity: he rips our brains from their intellectual foundations; twists them through a tour of physics, mathematics, computer science, and philosophy; stuffs them full of facts and theorems; tickles them until they cry ‘Uncle’; and then drops them, quivering, back into our skulls. Aaronson raises deep questions of how the physical universe is put together and why it is put together the way it is. While we read his lucid explanations we can believe – at least while we hold the book in our hands – that we understand the answers, too.” —Seth Lloyd
“Scott Aaronson has written a beautiful and highly original synthesis of what we know about some of the most fundamental questions in science: What is information? What does it mean to compute? What is the nature of mind and of free will?” —Michael Nielsen
“Not since Richard Feynman’s Lectures on Physics has there been a set of lecture notes as brilliant and as entertaining. Aaronson leads the reader on a wild romp through the most important intellectual achievements in computing and physics, weaving these seemingly disparate fields into a captivating narrative for our modern age of information. Aaronson wildly runs through the fields of physics and computers, showing us how they are connected, how to understand our computational universe, and what questions exist on the borders of these fields that we still don’t understand. This book is a poem disguised as a set of lecture notes. The lectures are on computing and physics, complexity theory and mathematical logic and quantum physics. The poem is made up of proofs, jokes, stories, and revelations, synthesizing the two towering fields of computer science and physics into a coherent tapestry of sheer intellectual awesomeness.” —Dave Bacon
After months of overhearing people saying things like the above—in the halls of MIT, the checkout line at Trader Joe’s, the bathroom, anywhere—I finally had to ask in annoyance: “is all this buzz justified? I mean, I’m sure the book is as deep, hilarious, and worldview-changing as everyone says it is. But, after all, it’s based off lecture notes that have long been available for free on the web. And Aaronson, being the magnanimous, open-access-loving saint that he is, has no plans to remove the online notes, even though he could really use the royalties from book sales to feed his growing family. Nor does Cambridge University Press object to his principled decision.”
“No, you don’t understand,” they told me. “Word on the street has it that the book is extensively updated for 2013—that it’s packed with new discussions of things like algebrization, lattice-based cryptography, the QIP=PSPACE theorem, the ‘quantum time travel controversy,’ BosonSampling, black-hole firewalls, and even the Australian models episode. They say it took years of painstaking work, by Aaronson and his student Alex Arkhipov, to get the notes into book form: fixing mistakes, clarifying difficult points, smoothing out rough edges, all while leaving intact the original’s inimitable humor. I even heard Aaronson reveals he’s changed his mind about certain things since 2006. How could you not want such a labor of love on your bookshelf?”
Exasperated, I finally exclaimed: “But the book isn’t even out yet in North America! Amazon.com says it won’t ship until April 30.”
“Sure,” one gas-station attendant replied to me, “but the secret is, it’s available now from Amazon.co.uk. Personally, I couldn’t wait a month, so I ordered it shipped to me from across the pond. But if you’re a less hardcore quantum complexity theory fan, and you live in North America, you can also preorder the book from Amazon.com, and they’ll send it to you when it arrives.”

182,1270,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1270,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2013-03-19,Scott Aaronson,John Preskill: My Lodestar of Awesomeness,"I got back a couple days ago from John Preskill‘s 60th birthday symposium at Caltech. To the general public, Preskill is probably best known for winning two bets against Stephen Hawking. To readers of Shtetl-Optimized, he might be known for his leadership in quantum information science, his pioneering work in quantum error-correction, his beautiful lecture notes, or even his occasional comments here (though these days he has his own group blog and Twitter feed to keep him busy). I know John as a friend, colleague, and mentor who’s done more for me than I can say.
The symposium was a blast—a chance to hear phenomenal talks, enjoy the California sun, and catch up with old friends like Dave Bacon (who stepped down as Pontiff before stepping down as Pontiff was cool). The only bad part was that I inadvertently insulted John in my talk, by calling him my “lodestar of sanity.” What I meant was that, for 13 years, I’ve known plenty of physicists who can be arbitrarily off-base when they talk about computer science and vice versa, but I’ve only ever known John to be on-base about either. If you asked him a question involving, say, both Barrington’s Theorem and Majorana fermions, he’s one of the few people on earth who would know both, seem totally unfazed by your juxtaposing them, and probably have an answer that he’d carefully tailor to your level of knowledge and interest. In a polyglot field like quantum information, that alone makes him invaluable. But along with his penetrating insight comes enviable judgment and felicity of expression: unlike some of us (me), John always manages to tell the truth without offending his listeners. If I were somehow entrusted with choosing a President of the United States, he’d be one of my first choices, certainly ahead of myself.
Anyway, it turned out that John didn’t like my use of the word “sane” to summarize the above: for him (understandably, in retrospect), it had connotations of being humorless and boring, two qualities I’ve never seen in him. (Also, as I pointed out later, the amount of time John has spent helping me and patiently explaining stuff to me does weigh heavily against his sanity.) So I hereby rename John my Lodestar of Awesomeness.
In case anyone cares, my talk was entitled “Hidden Variables as Fruitful Dead Ends”; the PowerPoint slides are here. I spoke about a new preprint by Adam Bouland, Lynn Chua, George Lowther, and myself, on possibility and impossibility results for “ψ-epistemic theories” (a class of hidden-variable theories that was also the subject of the recent PBR Theorem, discussed previously on this blog). My talk also included material from my old paper Quantum Computing and Hidden Variables.
The complete program is here. A few highlights (feel free to mention others in the comments):
- Patrick Hayden spoke about a beautiful result of himself and Alex May, on “where and when a qubit can be.” After the talk, I commented that it’s lucky for the sake of Hayden and May’s induction proof that 3 happens to be the next integer after 2. If you get that joke, then I think you’ll understand their result and vice versa.
- Lenny Susskind—whose bestselling The Theoretical Minimum is on my to-read list—spoke about his views on the AMPS firewall argument. As you know if you’ve been reading physics blogs, the firewall argument has been burning up (har, har) the world of quantum gravity for months, putting up for grabs aspects of black hole physics long considered settled (or not, depending on who you ask). Lenny gave a typically-masterful summary, which for the first time enabled me to understand the role played in the AMPS argument by “the Zone” (a region near the black hole but outside its event horizon, in which the Hawking radiation behaves a little differently than it does when it’s further away). I was particularly struck by Lenny’s comment that whether an observer falling into a black hole encounters a firewall might be “physics’ Axiom of Choice”: that is, we can only follow the logical consequences of theories we formulate outside black-hole event horizons, and maybe those theories simply don’t decide the firewall question one way or the other. (Then again, maybe they do.) Lenny also briefly mentioned a striking recent paper by Harlow and Hayden, which argues that the true resolution of the AMPS paradox might involve … wait for it … computational complexity, and specifically, the difficulty of solving QSZK (Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge) problems in BQP. And what’s a main piece evidence that QSZK⊄BQP? Why, the collision lower bound, which I proved 12 years ago while a summer student at Caltech and an awestruck attendee of Preskill’s weekly group meetings. Good thing no one told me back then that black holes were involved.
- Charlie Bennett talked about things that I’ve never had the courage to give a talk about, like the Doomsday Argument and the Fermi Paradox. But his disarming, avuncular manner made it all seem less crazy than it was.
- Paul Ginsparg, founder of the arXiv, presented the results of a stylometric analysis of John Preskill’s and Alexei Kitaev’s research papers. The main results were as follows: (1) John and Alexei are easily distinguishable from each other, due in part to the more latter’s “Russian” use of function words (“the,” “which,” “that,” etc.). (2) Alexei, despite having lived in the US for more than a decade, is if anything becoming more “Russian” in his function word use over time. (3) Even more interestingly, John is also becoming more “Russian” in his function word use—a possible result of his long interaction with Alexei. (4) A joint paper by Kitaev and Preskill was indeed written by both of them. (Update: While detained at the airport, Paul decided to post an online video of his talk.)
Speaking of which, the great Alexei Kitaev himself—the $3 million man—spoke about Berry curvature for many-body systems, but unfortunately I had to fly back early (y’know, 2-month-old baby) and missed his talk. Maybe someone else can provide a summary.
Happy 60th birthday, John!
Two unrelated announcements.
1. Everyone who reads this blog should buy Sean Carroll’s two recent books: From Eternity to Here (about the arrow of time) and The Particle at the End of the Universe (about the Higgs boson and quantum field theory more generally). They’re two of the best popular physics books I’ve ever read—in their honesty, humor, clarity, and total lack of pretense, they exemplify what every book in this genre should be but very few are. If you need even more inducement, go watch Sean hit it out of the park on the Colbert Report (and then do it again). I can’t watch those videos without seething with jealousy: given how many “OK”s and “y’know”s lard my every spoken utterance, I’ll probably never get invited to hawk a book on Colbert. Which is a shame, because as it happens, my Quantum Computing Since Democritus book will finally be released in the US by Cambridge University Press on April 30th! (It’s already available in the UK, but apparently needs to be shipped to the US by boat.) And it’s loaded with new material, not contained in the online lecture notes. And you can preorder it now. And my hawking of Sean’s books is in no way whatsoever related to any hope that Sean might return the favor with my book.
2. Recent Turing Award winner Silvio Micali asks me to advertise the Second Cambridge Area Economics and Computation Day (CAEC’13), which will be held on Friday April 26 at MIT.

183,1255,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1255,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2013-02-04,Scott Aaronson,Collaborative Refutation,"At least eight people—journalists, colleagues, blog readers—have now asked my opinion of a recent paper by Ross Anderson and Robert Brady, entitled “Why quantum computing is hard and quantum cryptography is not provably secure.” Where to begin?
- Based on a “soliton” model—which seems to be almost a local-hidden-variable model, though not quite—the paper advances the prediction that quantum computation will never be possible with more than 3 or 4 qubits. (Where “3 or 4” are not just convenient small numbers, but actually arise from the geometry of spacetime.) I wonder: before uploading their paper, did the authors check whether their prediction was, y’know, already falsified? How do they reconcile their proposal with (for example) the 8-qubit entanglement observed by Haffner et al. with trapped ions—not to mention the famous experiments with superconducting Josephson junctions, buckyballs, and so forth that have demonstrated the reality of entanglement among many thousands of particles (albeit not yet in a “controllable” form)?
- The paper also predicts that, even with 3 qubits, general entanglement will only be possible if the qubits are not collinear; with 4 qubits, general entanglement will only be possible if the qubits are not coplanar. Are the authors aware that, in ion-trap experiments (like those of David Wineland that recently won the Nobel Prize), the qubits generally are arranged in a line? See for example this paper, whose abstract reads in part: “Here we experimentally demonstrate quantum error correction using three beryllium atomic-ion qubits confined to a linear, multi-zone trap.”
- Finally, the paper argues that, because entanglement might not be a real phenomenon, the security of quantum key distribution remains an open question. Again: are the authors aware that the most practical QKD schemes, like BB84, never use entanglement at all? And that therefore, even if the paper’s quasi-local-hidden-variable model were viable (which it’s not), it still wouldn’t justify the claim in the title that “…quantum cryptography is not provably secure”?
Yeah, this paper is pretty uninformed even by the usual standards of attempted quantum-mechanics-overthrowings. Let me now offer three more general thoughts.
First thought: it’s ironic that I’m increasingly seeing eye-to-eye with Lubos Motl—who once called me “the most corrupt piece of moral trash”—in his rantings against the world’s “anti-quantum-mechanical crackpots.” Let me put it this way: David Deutsch, Chris Fuchs, Sheldon Goldstein, and Roger Penrose hold views about quantum mechanics that are diametrically opposed to one another’s. Yet each of these very different physicists has earned my admiration, because each, in his own way, is trying to listen to whatever quantum mechanics is saying about how the world works. However, there are also people all of whose “thoughts” about quantum mechanics are motivated by the urge to plug their ears and shut out whatever quantum mechanics is saying—to show how whatever naïve ideas they had before learning QM might still be right, and how all the experiments of the last century that seem to indicate otherwise might still be wiggled around. Like monarchists or segregationists, these people have been consistently on the losing side of history for generations—so it’s surprising, to someone like me, that they continue to show up totally unfazed and itching for battle, like the knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail with his arms and legs hacked off. (“Bell’s Theorem? Just a flesh wound!”)
Like any physical theory, of course quantum mechanics might someday be superseded by an even deeper theory. If and when that happens, it will rank alongside Newton’s apple, Einstein’s elevator, and the discovery of QM itself among the great turning points in the history of physics. But it’s crucial to understand that that’s not what we’re discussing here. Here we’re discussing the possibility that quantum mechanics is wrong, not for some deep reason, but for a trivial reason that was somehow overlooked since the 1920s—that there’s some simple classical model that would make everyone exclaim, “oh! well, I guess that whole framework of exponentially-large Hilbert space was completely superfluous, then. why did anyone ever imagine it was needed?” And the probability of that is comparable to the probability that the Moon is made of Gruyère. If you’re a Bayesian with a sane prior, stuff like this shouldn’t even register.
Second thought: this paper illustrates, better than any other I’ve seen, how despite appearances, the “quantum computing will clearly be practical in a few years!” camp and the “quantum computing is clearly impossible!” camp aren’t actually opposed to each other. Instead, they’re simply two sides of the same coin. Anderson and Brady start from the “puzzling” fact that, despite what they call “the investment of tremendous funding resources worldwide” over the last decade, quantum computing still hasn’t progressed beyond a few qubits, and propose to overthrow quantum mechanics as a way to resolve the puzzle. To me, this is like arguing in 1835 that, since Charles Babbage still hasn’t succeeded in building a scalable classical computer, we need to rewrite the laws of physics in order to explain why classical computing is impossible. I.e., it’s a form of argument that only makes sense if you’ve adopted what one might call the “Hype Axiom”: the axiom that any technology that’s possible sometime in the future, must in fact be possible within the next few years.
Third thought: it’s worth noting that, if (for example) you found Michel Dyakonov’s arguments against QC (discussed on this blog a month ago) persuasive, then you shouldn’t find Anderson’s and Brady’s persuasive, and vice versa. Dyakonov agrees that scalable QC will never work, but he ridicules the idea that we’d need to modify quantum mechanics itself to explain why. Anderson and Brady, by contrast, are so eager to modify QM that they don’t mind contradicting a mountain of existing experiments. Indeed, the question occurs to me of whether there’s any pair of quantum computing skeptics whose arguments for why QC can’t work are compatible with one another’s. (Maybe Alicki and Dyakonov?)
But enough of this. The truth is that, at this point in my life, I find it infinitely more interesting to watch my two-week-old daughter Lily, as she discovers the wonderful world of shapes, colors, sounds, and smells, than to watch Anderson and Brady, as they fail to discover the wonderful world of many-particle quantum mechanics. So I’m issuing an appeal to the quantum computing and information community. Please, in the comments section of this post, explain what you thought of the Anderson-Brady paper. Don’t leave me alone to respond to this stuff; I don’t have the time or the energy. If you get quantum probability, then stand up and be measured!",6904,"['60b7acd1469c62c6dca0becdfe3c81cec932eb3020332abf2c4a89aba0e2e85c',

Video of the talk is now available at VideoLectures net. That site also did a short written interview with me, where they asked about the “message” of my talk (which is unfortunately hard to summarize, though I tried!), as well as the Aaron Swartz case and various other things. If you just want the PowerPoint slides from my talk, you can get those here.
Now, I could’ve just given my usual talk on quantum computing and complexity. But besides increasing boredom with that talk, one reason for my unusual topic was that, when I sent in the abstract, I was under the mistaken impression that NIPS was at least half a “neuroscience” conference. So, I felt a responsibility to address how quantum information science might intersect the study of the brain, even if the intersection ultimately turned out to be the empty set! (As I say in the talk, the fact that people have speculated about connections between the two, and have sometimes been wrong but for interesting reasons, could easily give me 45 minutes’ worth of material.)
Anyway, it turned out that, while NIPS was founded by people interested in modeling the brain, these days it’s more of a straight machine learning conference. Still, I hope the audience there at least found my talk an amusing appetizer to their hearty meal of kernels, sparsity, and Bayesian nonparametric regression. I certainly learned a lot from them; while this was my first machine learning conference, I’ll try to make sure it isn’t my last.
(Incidentally, the full set of NIPS videos is here; it includes great talks by Terry Sejnowski, Stanislas Dehaene, Geoffrey Hinton, and many others. It was a weird honor to be in such distinguished company — I wouldn’t have invited myself!)",1944,"['b70cfc486581ea11a921c8a4b7d4d1585958052473af66417f7bdaf60a957e72', 'b22374efc36997d4076696dc5404b2d2abf4c743e541593c02f2681355de4212', '64ee8a1b2c9b70e1de30fedb7a9c972140767c9d73b124bce8ef934ea2d620f0', '61b355653c464194b266c3375eb6f2723206b87322fec76ef7da60ac8aa7614b', '600f058ebf5c7a2cf83cc4f31c0967934fb475fcd1267bedfbf19ad03eea4556', 'ff5284b648a101ccb16161a084ec957c9f7d0daf7c91b2b4463371353ba353a6', 'dc4e09beca2cddd438dd96f206477dcf0d58e258c52556ec5abe034e7368a5ef', '924ad2debbd2ef27ce30daa4e2553ceb862892f68e2f1b4bb7d58b8ec63513e3', '2e8938d6303246f801b814a036078f2feaff30d30c9faea316cad973b91058e7', 'afd63e1521ebfe611c1d5314afdb891604bd37083f8ec8dc861033151b740bed', '5ce5fb3150f363dfebdad1de2c1004d07d6437196069484225375386ca8670d5', 'e076ea4b47fd74a092b3f3c3f1fe54b0585054dc2db4c0efb6d231ff8612a64e', '54fbfa456ec778b8136264d3589e330470abbc4afcd32c06d358ab90e2d57de1', '2383ebac39584018fc4b3586dedf2b767a59313dcfab56d6a43f1cff9a10f09e', 'a8abed38854fe0552b8b6847a188bbc7585a11182ee7737d60adab3140ab6620', 'aa5f0594fcaef27f958934f6ee2b6382d177cb44bc678280865c642c5bef09ab', 'ca774691be9a6224cc12df3c5faf8d8a599336dcc999a05534c64ab06791f811', '74b1a1d03c2cf68f18ec1f66285e2b353fbfe73fca0b17ab0e0f53058027624d', '886012235be5fe5fbeb5ad1edae08a1731a397c01d1f85070b0cca61a5e36a4c']"

The comments—by QC researchers (Preskill, Kuperberg, Gottesman, Fitzsimons…), skeptics (Dyakonov, Kalai, …), and interested outsiders alike—are some of the most interesting I’ve seen in this two-decade-old debate.
At the risk of crass immodesty, I just posted a comment whose ending amused me so much, I had to promote it to its own post. My starting point was an idea that several skeptics, including Dyakonov, have articulated in this debate, and which I’ll paraphrase as follows:
Sure, quantum computing might be “possible in principle.” But only in the same sense that teaching a donkey how to read, transmuting large amounts of lead into gold, or doing a classical computation in the center of the Sun are “possible in principle.” In other words, the task is at the same time phenomenally difficult, and fundamentally arbitrary and quixotic even if you did somehow achieve it.
Since I considered this argument an important one, I wrote a response, which stressed how quantum computing is different both because it strives to solve problems that flat-out can’t feasibly be solved any other way if standard complexity conjectures are correct, and because the goal—namely, expanding the human race’s computational powers beyond classical polynomial time—is not at all an arbitrary one. However, I then felt the need to expand on the last point, since it occurred to me that it’s both central to this debate and almost never discussed explicitly.
How do I know that the desire for computational power isn’t just an arbitrary human quirk?
Well, the reason I know is that math isn’t arbitrary, and computation is nothing more or less than the mechanizable part of solving math problems.
Let me put it this way: if we ever make contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, they might have three sexes and five heads. But they, too, will have encountered the problem of factoring integers into primes. Indeed, because they’ll inhabit the same physical universe as we do, they’ll even have encountered the problem of simulating quantum physics. And therefore, putting the two together, they’ll almost certainly have discovered something like Shor’s algorithm — though they’ll call it “Zork’s bloogorithm” or whatever.",2376,"['e5417f39e97d8742729b7916873e6c3415cf6900e7cc24a5d50cde274ac0a464', '52455d2380696109cb271cb41991992c6fa14a00f8528211afadf1984e38ecbf',

186,1211,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1211,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2013-01-02,Scott Aaronson,Happy New Year! My response to M. I. Dyakonov,"A couple weeks ago M. I. Dyakonov, a longtime quantum computing skeptic, published a new paper setting out his arguments (maybe “grievances” is a more accurate word) against quantum computing research. Looking for a way to procrastinate from other work I have to do, I decided to offer some thoughts in response.
To me, perhaps the most striking aspect of Dyakonov’s paper is what it doesn’t claim. Unlike Leonid Levin, Oded Goldreich, and several other quantum computing skeptics I’ve engaged, Dyakonov never seriously entertains the possibility of a general principle that would explain why scalable quantum computing is not possible. (Thus, my $100K prize presumably isn’t relevant to him.) He even ridicules discussion of such a principle (see the end of this post). The unwillingness to say that scalable QC can’t work, or to articulate a reason why, saves Dyakonov from the need to explore what else would need to be true about the physical world if scalable QC were impossible. For example, would there then be an efficient algorithm to simulate arbitrary quantum systems on a classical computer—or at least, all quantum systems that can plausibly arise in Nature? Dyakonov need not, and does not, evince any curiosity about such questions. In his game, it’s only the quantum computing proponents who are on trial; there’s no need for examination of the other side.
That being so, Dyakonov focuses on what he sees as unrealistic assumptions in known versions of the Quantum Fault-Tolerance Theorem, covering well-trodden ground but with some strange twists. He accuses quantum computing researchers of a “widespread belief that the |0〉 and |1〉 states ‘in the computational basis’ are something absolute, akin to the on/off states of an electrical switch, or of a transistor in a digital computer.” He then follows with a somewhat-patronizing discussion of how no continuous quantity can be manipulated perfectly, and how |0〉 and |1〉 are just arbitrary labels whose meanings could change over time due to drift in the preparation and measurement devices. Well, yes, it’s obvious that |0〉 and |1〉 don’t have absolute meanings, but is it not equally obvious that we can give them meanings, through suitable choices of initial states, gates, and measurement settings? And if the meanings of |0〉 and |1〉 drift over time, due to the imprecision of our devices … well, if the amount of drift is upper-bounded by some sufficiently small constant, then we can regard it as simply yet another source of noise, and apply standard fault-tolerance methods to correct it. If the drift is unbounded, then we do need better devices.
(Fault-tolerance mavens: please use the comments for more detailed discussion! To my inexpert eyes, Dyakonov doesn’t seem to engage the generality of the already-known fault-tolerance theorems—a generality traceable to the fact that what powers those results is ultimately just the linearity of quantum mechanics, not some fragile coincidence that one expects to disappear with the slightest change in assumptions. But I’m sure others can say more.)
Anyway, from his discussion of fault-tolerance, Dyakonov concludes only that the possibility of scalable quantum computing in the real world should be considered an open question.
Surprisingly—since many QC skeptics wouldn’t be caught dead making such an argument—Dyakonov next turns around and says that, well, OK, fine, even if scalable QCs can be built, they still won’t be good for much. Shor’s factoring algorithm is irrelevant, since people would simply switch to other public-key cryptosystems that appear secure even against quantum attack. Simulating quantum physics “would be an interesting and useful achievement, but hardly revolutionary, unless we understand this term in some very narrow sense.” And what about Grover’s algorithm? In an endnote, Dyakonov writes:
Quantum algorithms that provide (with an ideal quantum computer!) only polynomial speed-up compared to digital computing, like the Grover algorithm, became obsolete due to the polynomial slow-down imposed by error correction.
The above is flat-out mistaken. The slowdown imposed by quantum error-correction is polylogarithmic, not polynomial, so it doesn’t come close to wiping out the Grover speedup (or the subexponential speedups that might be achievable, e.g., with the adiabatic algorithm, which Dyakonov doesn’t mention).
But disregarding the polylog/polynomial confusion (which recurs elsewhere in the article), and other technical issues about fault-tolerance, up to this point many quantum computing researchers could happily agree with Dyakonov—and have said similar things many times themselves. Dyakonov even quotes Dorit Aharonov, one of the discoverers of quantum fault-tolerance, writing, “In a sense, the question of noisy quantum computation is theoretically closed. But a question still ponders our minds: Are the assumptions on the noise correct?”
(And as for QC researchers coming clean about limitations of quantum computers? This is just hearsay, but I’m told there’s a QC researcher who actually chose “Quantum computers are not known to be able to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time” as the tagline for his blog!)
Dyakonov fumes about how popular articles, funding agency reports, and so forth have overhyped progress in quantum computing, leaving the conditions out of theorems and presenting incremental advances as breakthroughs. Here I sadly agree. As readers of Shtetl-Optimized can hopefully attest, I’ve seen it as my professional duty to spend part of my life battling cringeworthy quantum computing claims. Every week, it feels like I talk to another journalist who tries to get me to say that this or that QC result will lead to huge practical applications in the near future, since that’s what the editor is looking for. And every week I refuse to say it, and try to steer the conversation toward “deeper” scientific questions. Sometimes I succeed and sometimes not, but at least I never hang up the phone feeling dirty.
On the other hand, it would be interesting to know whether, in the history of science, there’s ever been a rapidly-developing field, of interest to large numbers of scientists and laypeople alike, that wasn’t surrounded by noxious clouds of exaggeration, incomprehension, and BS. I can imagine that, when Isaac Newton published his Principia, a Cambridge University publicist was there to explain to reporters that the new work proved that the Moon was basically an apple.
But none of that is where Dyakonov loses me. Here’s where he does: from the statements
A) The feasibility of scalable quantum computing in the physical world remains open, and
B) The applications of quantum computing would probably be real but specialized,
he somehow, unaided by argument, arrives at the conclusion
C) Quantum computing is a failed, pathological research program, which will soon die out and be of interest only to sociologists.
Let me quote from his conclusion at length:
I believe that, in spite of appearances, the quantum computing story is nearing its end, not because somebody proves that it is impossible, but rather because 20 years is a typical lifetime of any big bubble in science, because too many unfounded promises have been made, because people get tired and annoyed by almost daily announcements of new “breakthroughs”, because all the tenure positions in quantum computing are already occupied, and because the proponents are growing older and less zealous, while the younger generation seeks for something new …
In fact, quantum computing is not so much a scientific, as a sociological problem which has expanded out of all proportion due to the US system of funding scientific research (which is now being copied all over the world). While having some positive sides, this system is unstable against spontaneous formation of bubbles and mafia-like structures. It pushes the average researcher to wild exaggerations on the border of fraud and sometimes beyond. Also, it is much easier to understand the workings of the funding system, than the workings of Nature, and these two skills only rarely come together.
The QC story says a lot about human nature, the scientific community, and the society as a whole, so it deserves profound psycho-sociological studies, which should begin right now, while the main actors are still alive and can be questioned.
In case the message isn’t yet clear enough, Dyakonov ends by comparing quantum computing to the legend of Nasreddin, who promised the Sultan that he could teach a donkey how to read.
Had he [Nasreddin] the modern degree of sophistication, he could say, first, that there is no theorem forbidding donkeys to read. And, since this does not contradict any known fundamental principles, the failure to achieve this goal would reveal new laws of Nature. So, it is a win-win strategy: either the donkey learns to read, or new laws will be discovered.
Second, he could say that his research may, with some modifications, be generalized to other animals, like goats and sheep, as well as to insects, like ants, gnats, and flies, and this will have a tremendous potential for improving national security: these beasts could easily cross the enemy lines, read the secret plans, and report them back to us.
Dyakonov chose his example carefully. Turnabout: consider the first person who had the idea of domesticating a wild donkey, teaching the beast to haul people’s stuff on its back. If you’d never seen a domestic animal before, that idea would sound every bit as insane as donkey literacy. And indeed, it probably took hundreds of years of selective breeding before it worked well.
In general, if there’s no general principle saying that X can’t work, the truth might be that X can probably never work, but the reasons are too messy to articulate. Or the truth might be that X can work. How can you ever find out, except by, y’know, science? Try doing X. If you fail, try to figure out why. If you figure it out, share the lessons with others. Look for an easier related problem Y that you can solve. Think about whether X is impossible; if you could show its impossibility, that might advance human knowledge even more than X itself would have. If the methods you invented for X don’t work, see if they work for some other, unrelated problem Z. Congratulations! You’ve just reinvented quantum computing research. Or really, any kind of research.
But there’s something else that bothers me about Dyakonov’s donkey story: its specificity. Why fixate on teaching a donkey, only a donkey, how to read? Earlier in his article, Dyakonov ridicules the diversity of physical systems that have been considered as qubits—electron spin qubits, nuclear spin qubits, Josephson superconducting qubits, cavity photon qubits, etc.—seeing the long list as symptomatic of some deep pathology in the field. Yet he never notices the tension with his donkey story. Isn’t it obvious that, if Nasreddin had been a quantum computing experimentalist, then after failing to get good results with donkeys, he’d simply turn his attention to teaching cows, parrots, snakes, elephants, dolphins, or gorillas how to read? Furthermore, while going through the zoo, Nasreddin might discover that he could teach gorillas how to recognize dozens of pictorial symbols: surely a nice partial result. But maybe he’d have an even better idea: why not build his own reading machine? The machine could use a camera to photograph the pages of a book, and a computer chip to decode the letters. If one wanted, the machine could be even be the size and shape of a donkey, and could emit braying sounds. Now, maybe Nasreddin would fail to build this reading machine, but even then, we know today that it would have been a noble failure, like those of Charles Babbage or Ted Nelson. Nasreddin would’ve failed only by being too far ahead of his time.",11877,"['3d940d29e01a834284578fd7705ef3e92558df7f4625af157aa441ed23644f27',

187,1181,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1181,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2012-12-23,Scott Aaronson,Quantum Complexity Theory Student Project Showcase 2!,"(Note: The “2!” in the title of this post really does mean “2 factorial,” if you want it to.)
With the end of the semester upon us, it’s time for a once-every-two-year tradition: showcasing student projects from my 6.845 Quantum Complexity Theory graduate course at MIT. For my previous showcase, in 2010, I chose six projects that I thought were especially outstanding. This year, however, there were so many great projects—and so many, in particular, that could actually be useful to people in quantum computing—that I decided simply to open up the showcase to the whole class. I had 17 takers; their project reports and 10-minute presentation slides are below.
Let me mention a few projects that tried to do something new and audacious. Jenny Barry generalizes the notion of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to the quantum case, and uses a recent result of Eisert et al., showing that certain problems in quantum measurement theory are undecidable (like, literally Turing-undecidable), to show that goal state reachability for “QOMDPs” is also Turing-undecidable (despite being decidable for classical POMDPs). Matt Falk suggests a novel quantum algorithm for spatial search on the 2D grid, and gives some numerical evidence that the algorithm finds a marked item in O(√n) time (which, if true, would be the optimal bound, beating the previous runtime of O(√(n log n))). Matt Coudron and Henry Yuen set out to prove that the Vazirani-Vidick protocol for quantum randomness expansion is optimal, and achieve some interesting partial results. Mohammad Bavarian (well, jointly with me) asks whether there’s a fast quantum algorithm for PARITY that gets the right answer on just slightly more than 50% of the inputs—and shows, rather surprisingly, that this question is closely related to some of the hardest open problems about Boolean functions, like sensitivity versus block sensitivity.
This year, though, I also want to call special attention to the survey projects, since some of them resulted in review articles that could be of real use to students and researchers in quantum computing theory. Notably, Adam Bookatz compiled the first list of essentially all known QMA-complete problems, analogous to (but shorter than!) Garey and Johnson’s listing of known NP-complete problems in 1979. Chris Graves surveyed the known quantum fault-tolerance bounds. Finally, three projects took on the task of understanding and explaining some of the most important recent results in quantum complexity theory: Travis Hance on Thomas Vidick and Tsuyoshi Ito’s NEXP in MIP* breakthrough; Emily Stark on Mark Zhandry’s phenomenal results on the security of classical cryptographic constructions against quantum attack; and Max Zimet on Jordan-Lee-Preskill’s major work on simulation of quantum field theories.
(Oops, sorry … did I use words like “important,” “breakthrough,” and “phenomenal” too often in that last sentence, thereby triggering the wrath of the theoretical computer science excitement police? Well then, come over to my apartment and friggin’ arrest me.)
Anyway, thanks so much to all the students for making 6.845 such an awesome class (at least on my end)! Without further ado, here’s the complete project showcase:",3247,"['9d41eeb06fd8d0ed5263a29508d3276f0907680f639939951e12646d4c06ca7e', '6a31d9c9755863e054920c0a3fc542df5ec66dee9dd0648ccad989a4dc2f6452', 'bf53b624bbbdc4f94f485afef4bcee5d01a2ebfabdeb1baf1ba6f11d15d65f00', '12c18cdeb10f6278d5eb2ca8d7c0525dec9aa4fff5995e83c04be847bd892d90', 'bd6df6f8fe67a483a71628a7a0ce22e92a1cc502c73e4b506bef144637408f18', 'cf8ab5170c3dbab4de3c87975a8c564d0abac8e573859fd86ca83585f49610aa', '8a9c52d9fb292e1298c2e740850be846a7e2ba46c4812692379115932e5c0ae3', '4dba6e10bdb5379a3c5d5d06d47c102b0f4fcf66af01e84159e36eb220694e5b', '8183f31b4e656cc674ef22dbdac875f58cf3b97fafc1597e59ca5e5017aa233d', '3d5bcc6d036bdd3cc55a3b4bf976e4dac8d53ec6bf52064316b6554d2ce7034b', '1e4971152ccab7e91c2d045c2edf8b8cba3082e2200255a7d70deda587781025', '301feb639d4e79238216a4aabef3d861099f0fe443a0ba522f25c5b0438b3b75', '571fca63ae61b72aa17dfe4d6a1cc9209e2cb3fa02f26759c86f25714cd305d7', '6ac2008a0c25d56f8daf0eb864cd3df12ab3a7886896fbe80588d18096418294', '6701a9451c96bd4d70a4d2211b9da854438e2dff2c82c8101714d257bfb3233f', '19bf28831b794c857800aae48ae77304e384ca7f3900a011bc0f5e7d4673fffd', 'd233f6a0465d4e2c1a567bf85f16302a8ad97ca35bf4b9db56cc29c7d675a211', 'a7a482af56382c8d008e1b861158e0c11ab6015a0b53889b3a5a83e873118a64', '0b89647a5f6961f17003e79d7aa4055005939a9dfc25ac3ce0de983c4a9cb2e7']"

And the results were obtained by no fewer than four independent experimental groups, some of whom have now published in Science. One of the groups is based in Brisbane, Australia, one in Oxford, one in Vienna, and one in Rome; they coordinated to release their results the same day. That’s right, the number of papers (4) that these groups managed to choreograph to appear simultaneously actually exceeds the number of photons that they so managed (3). The Brisbane group was even generous enough to ask me to coauthor: I haven’t been within 10,000 miles of their lab, but I did try to make myself useful to them as a “complexity theory consultant.”
Here are links to the four experimental BosonSampling papers released in the past week:
- Experimental BosonSampling by Broome et al. (Brisbane)
- Experimental Boson Sampling by Tillmann et al. (Vienna)

I’ll be happy to answer further questions in the comments; for now, here’s a brief FAQ:
Q: Why do you need photons in particular for these experiments?
A: What we need is identical bosons, whose transition amplitudes are given by the permanents of matrices. If it were practical to do this experiment with Higgs bosons, they would work too! But photons are more readily available.
Q: But a BosonSampling device isn’t really a “computer,” is it?
A: It depends what you mean by “computer”! If you mean a physical system that you load input into, let evolve according to the laws of physics, then measure to get an answer to a well-defined mathematical problem, then sure, it’s a computer! The only question is whether it’s a useful computer. We don’t believe it can be used as a universal quantum computer—or even, for that matter, as a universal classical computer. More than that, Alex and I weren’t able to show that solving the BosonSampling problem has any practical use for anything. However, we did manage to amass evidence that, despite being useless, the BosonSampling problem is also hard (at least for a classical computer). And for us, the hardness of classical simulation was the entire point.
Q: So, these experiments reported in Science this week have done something that no classical computer could feasibly simulate?
A: No, a classical computer can handle the simulation of 3 photons without much—or really, any—difficulty. This is only a first step: before this, the analogous experiment (called the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip) had only ever been performed with 2 photons, for which there’s not even any difference in complexity between the permanent and the determinant (i.e., between bosons and fermions). However, if you could scale this experiment up to about 30 photons, then it’s likely that the experiment would be solving the BosonSampling problem faster than any existing classical computer (though the latter could eventually solve the problem as well). And if you could scale it up to 100 photons, then you might never even know if your experiment was working correctly, because a classical computer would need such an astronomical amount of time to check the results.",4272,"['7903c6e29779ea1db4fedf29ad7a09c3434981ead6bebf44b9ce234366c94ea8', 'd2ebbd40119f079ffd67df67ddebc6b6422f23edc8d93e49eb726a120b247252', '0e41cef90fe4f81f0df566777dfc6b1d4c6b6698d4a8d684b796d1628d522cf6', '1971e5873a98d32074911e8518f1388ed65278b963155d836313a474da537d91', '253422b2d01f0be16e17f371ffbaf06a2a9b06aba14f5cf482e0c9f8668c2038', '979c788eb80e5fa6dc34d7b6231a59e85cc4d0723c00a2ad82ff7989b74d5dfe', '3db85345543b746ee0bbfa3a22f159bb519e16843859056d8e387cffbc856908', 'e2b2a8b2eb255607b5df7c1f87306c7d806e59dcb364a5a675e00bc4c2bdb324', 'b4a5ac5eb5695c787cd968eaf74adad8b758e0e36fb5e5fc23aa052c57244b43', 'b7e84518cfdbc6a533d7e86072564ea1082b2b3d338e38cbffd4d0e062a1a2bd', 'ff9d53f58c9beb65abc2f862bfee097385fdd5cd47053d5c3b98db689d58d602', '0ff9d468e8ca832104016f8e6a0e0ebf52a421c1dd1dae7a3e8d812063d4dab4', '835c322d3ddaa08145450a070378a2acab4bfc265a31feac1012de1ff5ce0f3c', 'c6d54c465ea60d6e255ea2d7fc50b8d24a9a9cef0579de6e378f652ad631393a', '7014be9350e52f56d136f5550056bdcd429ce51d11e37c80234668325a9c72ab', '1eeab0daae2830bd764a4c38e34e294483a77a64a7cd0b7f0f173d7bded6b1de', '4cc1b39e7eca2b71b385142d295d30f17f11ea3f7852c7f13683fb6fc4fef57c', 'cd6a2b6fd4f7ec9fe3ca5c76a5b64ba8143a1b83bd75a3f89d8ccfb06ac48ca1', '9e64752628c8f3632c0b4ddba09e6b84a14992502326847205bdfed1764c095c', '89bd06fd42f590cac5ab387e557d0cedd150ddbe6ba48e9a6ca6fbc58867b292', 'ef107416d905b25f6f955ebfa89e7f42ecd928ddc3b5af4c3773e617a391686d', '7f4af92c8267338a092bb6cb25549d65514b8fe0c1c8791c0d4a2a29c46337f3', '7be892f39c550c1b598d4915f65745a867eb043fcfeff973d36a754b49c78467']"

In case anyone is interested, here’s a comment I posted over at Cosmic Variance, responding to a question about the relevance of Haroche and Wineland’s work for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.
The experiments of Haroche and Wineland, phenomenal as they are, have zero implications one way or the other for the MWI/Copenhagen debate (nor, for that matter, for third-party candidates like Bohm 🙂 ). In other words, while doing these experiments is a tremendous challenge requiring lots of new ideas, no sane proponent of any interpretation would have made predictions for their outcomes other than the ones that were observed. To do an experiment about which the proponents of different interpretations might conceivably diverge, it would be necessary to try to demonstrate quantum interference in a much, much larger system — for example, a brain or an artificially-intelligent quantum computer. And even then, the different interpretations arguably don’t make differing predictions about what the published results of such an experiment would be. If they differ at all, it’s in what they claim, or refuse to claim, about the experiences of the subject of the experiment, while the experiment is underway. But if quantum mechanics is right, then the subject would necessarily have forgotten those experiences by the end of the experiment — since otherwise, no interference could be observed!
So, yeah, barring any change to the framework of quantum mechanics itself, it seems likely that people will be arguing about its interpretation forever. Sorry about that. 🙂
Where is he? So many wild claims being leveled, so many opportunities to set the record straight, and yet he completely fails to respond. Where’s the passion he showed just four years ago? Doesn’t he realize that having the facts on his side isn’t enough, has never been enough? It’s as if his mind is off somewhere else, or as if he’s tired of his role as a public communicator and no longer feels like performing it. Is his silence part of some devious master plan? Is he simply suffering from a lack of oxygen in the brain? What’s going on?
Yeah, yeah, I know. I should blog more. I’ll have more coming soon, but for now, two big announcements related to quantum computing.
Today the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded jointly to Serge Haroche and David Wineland, for “for ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems.” I’m not very familiar with Haroche’s work, but I’ve known of Wineland for a long time as possibly the top quantum computing experimentalist in the business, setting one record after another in trapped-ion experiments. In awarding this prize, the Swedes have recognized the phenomenal advances in atomic, molecular, and optical physics that have already happened over the last two decades, largely motivated by the goal of building a scalable quantum computer (along with other, not entirely unrelated goals, like more accurate atomic clocks). In so doing, they’ve given what’s arguably the first-ever “Nobel Prize for quantum computing research,” without violating their policy to reward only work that’s been directly confirmed by experiment. Huge congratulations to Haroche and Wineland!!
In other quantum computing developments: yes, I’m aware of the latest news from D-Wave, which includes millions of dollars in new funding from Jeff Bezos (the founder of Amazon.com, recipients of a large fraction of my salary). Despite having officially retired as Chief D-Wave Skeptic, I posted a comment on Tom Simonite’s article in MIT Technology Review, and also sent the following email to a journalist.
I’m probably not a good person to comment on the “business” aspects of D-Wave. They’ve been extremely successful raising money in the past, so it’s not surprising to me that they continue to be successful. For me, three crucial points to keep in mind are:
(1) D-Wave still hasn’t demonstrated 2-qubit entanglement, which I see as one of the non-negotiable “sanity checks” for scalable quantum computing. In other words: if you’re producing entanglement, then you might or might not be getting quantum speedups, but if you’re not producing entanglement, then our current understanding fails to explain how you could possibly be getting quantum speedups.
(2) Unfortunately, the fact that D-Wave’s machine solves some particular problem in some amount of time, and a specific classical computer running (say) simulated annealing took more time, is not (by itself) good evidence that D-Wave was achieving the speedup because of quantum effects. Keep in mind that D-Wave has now spent ~$100 million and ~10 years of effort on a highly-optimized, special-purpose computer for solving one specific optimization problem. So, as I like to put it, quantum effects could be playing the role of “the stone in a stone soup”: attracting interest, investment, talented people, etc. to build a device that performs quite well at its specialized task, but not ultimately because of quantum coherence in that device.
(3) The quantum algorithm on which D-Wave’s business model is based — namely, the quantum adiabatic algorithm — has the property that it “degrades gracefully” to classical simulated annealing when the decoherence rate goes up. This, fundamentally, is the thing that makes it difficult to know what role, if any, quantum coherence is playing in the performance of their device. If they were trying to use Shor’s algorithm to factor numbers, the situation would be much more clear-cut: a decoherent version of Shor’s algorithm just gives you random garbage. But a decoherent version of the adiabatic algorithm still gives you a pretty good (but now essentially “classical”) algorithm, and that’s what makes it hard to understand what’s going on here.
As I’ve said before, I no longer feel like playing an adversarial role. I really, genuinely hope D-Wave succeeds. But the burden is on them to demonstrate that their device uses quantum effects to obtain a speedup, and they still haven’t met that burden. When and if the situation changes, I’ll be happy to say so. Until then, though, I seem to have the unenviable task of repeating the same observation over and over, for 6+ years, and confirming that, no, the latest sale, VC round, announcement of another “application” (which, once again, might or might not exploit quantum effects), etc., hasn’t changed the truth of that observation.

190,1103,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1103,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2012-08-18,Scott Aaronson,Why Many-Worlds is not like Copernicanism,"[Update (8/26): Inspired by the great responses to my last Physics StackExchange question, I just asked a new one—also about the possibilities for gravitational decoherence, but now focused on Gambini et al.’s “Montevideo interpretation” of quantum mechanics.
Also, on a completely unrelated topic, my friend Jonah Sinick has created a memorial YouTube video for the great mathematician Bill Thurston, who sadly passed away last week. Maybe I should cave in and set up a Twitter feed for this sort of thing…]
[Update (8/26): I’ve now posted what I see as one of the main physics questions in this discussion on Physics StackExchange: “Reversing gravitational decoherence.” Check it out, and help answer if you can!]
[Update (8/23): If you like this blog, and haven’t yet read the comments on this post, you should probably do so! To those who’ve complained about not enough meaty quantum debates on this blog lately, the comment section of this post is my answer.]
[Update: Argh! For some bizarre reason, comments were turned off for this post. They’re on now. Sorry about that.]
In the meantime, though, since my flight here was delayed 4 hours, I decided to (1) pass the time, (2) distract myself from the inanities blaring on CNN at the airport gate, (3) honor Yakir’s half-century of work on the foundations of quantum mechanics, and (4) honor the commenters who wanted me to stop ranting and get back to quantum stuff, by sharing some thoughts about a topic that, unlike gun control or the Olympics, is completely uncontroversial: the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Proponents of MWI, such as David Deutsch, often argue that MWI is a lot like Copernican astronomy: an exhilarating expansion in our picture of the universe, which follows straightforwardly from Occam’s Razor applied to certain observed facts (the motions of the planets in one case, the double-slit experiment in the other). Yes, many holdouts stubbornly refuse to accept the new picture, but their skepticism says more about sociology than science. If you want, you can describe all the quantum-mechanical experiments anyone has ever done, or will do for the foreseeable future, by treating “measurement” as an unanalyzed primitive and never invoking parallel universes. But you can also describe all astronomical observations using a reference frame that places the earth at the center of the universe. In both cases, say the MWIers, the problem with your choice is its unmotivated perversity: you mangle the theory’s mathematical simplicity, for no better reason than a narrow parochial urge to place yourself and your own experiences at the center of creation. The observed motions of the planets clearly want a sun-centered model. In the same way, Schrödinger’s equation clearly wants measurement to be just another special case of unitary evolution—one that happens to cause your own brain and measuring apparatus to get entangled with the system you’re measuring, thereby “splitting” the world into decoherent branches that will never again meet. History has never been kind to people who put what they want over what the equations want, and it won’t be kind to the MWI-deniers either.
This is an important argument, which demands a response by anyone who isn’t 100% on-board with MWI. Unlike some people, I happily accept this argument’s framing of the issue: no, MWI is not some crazy speculative idea that runs afoul of Occam’s razor. On the contrary, MWI really is just the “obvious, straightforward” reading of quantum mechanics itself, if you take quantum mechanics literally as a description of the whole universe, and assume nothing new will ever be discovered that changes the picture.
Nevertheless, I claim that the analogy between MWI and Copernican astronomy fails in two major respects.
The first is simply that the inference, from interference experiments to the reality of many-worlds, strikes me as much more “brittle” than the inference from astronomical observations to the Copernican system, and in particular, too brittle to bear the weight that the MWIers place on it. Once you know anything about the dynamics of the solar system, it’s hard to imagine what could possibly be discovered in the future, that would ever again make it reasonable to put the earth at the “center.” By contrast, we do more-or-less know what could be discovered that would make it reasonable to privilege “our” world over the other MWI branches. Namely, any kind of “dynamical collapse” process, any source of fundamentally-irreversible decoherence between the microscopic realm and that of experience, any physical account of the origin of the Born rule, would do the trick.
Admittedly, like most quantum folks, I used to dismiss the notion of “dynamical collapse” as so contrived and ugly as not to be worth bothering with. But while I remain unimpressed by the specific models on the table (like the GRW theory), I’m now agnostic about the possibility itself. Yes, the linearity of quantum mechanics does indeed seem incredibly hard to tinker with. But as Roger Penrose never tires of pointing out, there’s at least one phenomenon—gravity—that we understand how to combine with quantum-mechanical linearity only in various special cases (like 2+1 dimensions, or supersymmetric anti-deSitter space), and whose reconciliation with quantum mechanics seems to raise fundamental problems (i.e., what does it even mean to have a superposition over different causal structures, with different Hilbert spaces potentially associated to them?).
To make the discussion more concrete, consider the proposed experiment of Bouwmeester et al., which seeks to test (loosely) whether one can have a coherent superposition over two states of the gravitational field that differ by a single Planck length or more. This experiment hasn’t been done yet, but some people think it will become feasible within a decade or two. Most likely it will just confirm quantum mechanics, like every previous attempt to test the theory for the last century. But it’s not a given that it will; quantum mechanics has really, truly never been tested in this regime. So suppose the interference pattern isn’t seen. Then poof! The whole vast ensemble of parallel universes spoken about by the MWI folks would have disappeared with a single experiment. In the case of Copernicanism, I can’t think of any analogous hypothetical discovery with even a shred of plausibility: maybe a vector field that pervades the universe but whose unique source was the earth? So, this is what I mean in saying that the inference from existing QM experiments to parallel worlds seems too “brittle.”
As you might remember, I wagered $100,000 that scalable quantum computing will indeed turn out to be compatible with the laws of physics. Some people considered that foolhardy, and they might be right—but I think the evidence seems pretty compelling that quantum mechanics can be extrapolated at least that far. (We can already make condensed-matter states involving entanglement among millions of particles; for that to be possible but not quantum computing would seem to require a nasty conspiracy.) On the other hand, when it comes to extending quantum-mechanical linearity all the way up to the scale of everyday life, or to the gravitational metric of the entire universe—as is needed for MWI—even my nerve falters. Maybe quantum mechanics does go that far up; or maybe, as has happened several times in physics when exploring a new scale, we have something profoundly new to learn. I wouldn’t give much more informative odds than 50/50.
The second way I’d say the MWI/Copernicus analogy breaks down arises from a closer examination of one of the MWIers’ favorite notions: that of “parochial-ness.” Why, exactly, do people say that putting the earth at the center of creation is “parochial”—given that relativity assures us that we can put it there, if we want, with perfect mathematical consistency? I think the answer is: because once you understand the Copernican system, it’s obvious that the only thing that could possibly make it natural to place the earth at the center, is the accident of happening to live on the earth. If you could fly a spaceship far above the plane of the solar system, and watch the tiny earth circling the sun alongside Mercury, Venus, and the sun’s other tiny satellites, the geocentric theory would seem as arbitrary to you as holding Cheez-Its to be the sole aim and purpose of human civilization. Now, as a practical matter, you’ll probably never fly that spaceship beyond the solar system. But that’s irrelevant: firstly, because you can very easily imagine flying the spaceship, and secondly, because there’s no in-principle obstacle to your descendants doing it for real.
Now let’s compare to the situation with MWI. Consider the belief that “our” universe is more real than all the other MWI branches. If you want to describe that belief as “parochial,” then from which standpoint is it parochial? The standpoint of some hypothetical godlike being who sees the entire wavefunction of the universe? The problem is that, unlike with my solar system story, it’s not at all obvious that such an observer can even exist, or that the concept of such an observer makes sense. You can’t “look in on the multiverse from the outside” in the same way you can look in on the solar system from the outside, without violating the quantum-mechanical linearity on which the multiverse picture depends in the first place.
The closest you could come, probably, is to perform a Wigner’s friend experiment, wherein you’d verify via an interference experiment that some other person was placed into a superposition of two different brain states. But I’m not willing to say with confidence that the Wigner’s friend experiment can even be done, in principle, on a conscious being: what if irreversible decoherence is somehow a necessary condition for consciousness? (We know that increase in entropy, of which decoherence is one example, seems intertwined with and possibly responsible for our subjective sense of the passage of time.) In any case, it seems clear that we can’t talk about Wigner’s-friend-type experiments without also talking, at least implicitly, about consciousness and the mind/body problem—and that that fact ought to make us exceedingly reluctant to declare that the right answer is obvious and that anyone who doesn’t see it is an idiot. In the case of Copernicanism, the “flying outside the solar system” thought experiment isn’t similarly entangled with any of the mysteries of personal identity.
There’s a reason why Nobel Prizes are regularly awarded for confirmations of effects that were predicted decades earlier by theorists, and that therefore surprised almost no one when they were finally found. Were we smart enough, it’s possible that we could deduce almost everything interesting about the world a priori. Alas, history has shown that we’re usually not smart enough: that even in theoretical physics, our tendencies to introduce hidden premises and to handwave across gaps in argument are so overwhelming that we rarely get far without constant sanity checks from nature.
I can’t think of any better summary of the empirical attitude than the famous comment by Donald Knuth: “Beware of bugs in the above code. I’ve only proved it correct; I haven’t tried it.” In the same way, I hereby declare myself ready to support MWI, but only with the following disclaimer: “Beware of bugs in my argument for parallel copies of myself. I’ve only proved that they exist; I haven’t heard a thing from them.”",11590,"['30b2cbb0f5e6e476c8312235b123bc6d4f1c99b963562b93a037419e41901394',

191,1075,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1075,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2012-07-12,Scott Aaronson,Scott in Scotland,"I’m in Edinburgh this week to visit my wonderful old friends Elham Kashefi and Rahul Santhanam, and to give a series of talks. It’s my first visit to my “ancestral homeland,” and as you can see above, I’ve enjoyed visiting my namesake monument and eating some freshly-ground haggis.
Earlier today, I was delighted to meet the matrix-multiplication-exponent-lowerer and unwilling Shtetl-Optimized celebrity Andrew Stothers, and to treat him to lunch. (I’d promised to buy Andrew a beer if I was ever in Edinburgh, to apologize for the blog-circus I somehow dragged him into, but he only wanted a diet Coke.) I’m now convinced that Andrew’s not publicizing his lowering of ω was mostly a very simple matter of his not being in contact with the theoretical computer science community. One factor might be that, here at U. of Edinburgh, the math and CS buildings are on different campuses two miles away from each other!
I apologize for the light-to-nonexistent blogging.

192,1028,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1028,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2012-05-10,Scott Aaronson,I was wrong about Joy Christian,"Update: I decided to close comments on this post and the previous Joy Christian post, because they simply became too depressing for me.
I’ve further decided to impose a moratorium, on this blog, on all discussions about the validity of quantum mechanics in the microscopic realm, the reality of quantum entanglement, or the correctness of theorems such as Bell’s Theorem. I might lift the moratorium at some future time. For now, though, life simply feels too short to me, and the actually-interesting questions too numerous. Imagine, for example, that there existed a devoted band of crackpots who believed, for complicated, impossible-to-pin-down reasons of topology and geometric algebra, that triangles actually have five corners. These crackpots couldn’t be persuaded by rational argument—indeed, they didn’t even use words and sentences the same way you do, to convey definite meaning. And crucially, they had infinite energy: you could argue with them for weeks, and they would happily argue back, until you finally threw up your hands in despair for all humanity, at which point the crackpots would gleefully declare, “haha, we won! the silly ‘triangles have 3 corners’ establishment cabal has admitted defeat!” And, in a sense, they would have won: with one or two exceptions, the vast majority who know full well how many corners a triangle has simply never showed up to the debate, thereby conceding to the 5-cornerists by default.
What would you in such a situation? What would you do? If you figure it out, please let me know (but by email, not by blog comment).
In response to my post criticizing his “disproof” of Bell’s Theorem, Joy Christian taunted me that “all I knew was words.” By this, he meant that my criticisms were entirely based on circumstantial evidence, for example that (1) Joy clearly didn’t understand what the word “theorem” even meant, (2) every other sentence he uttered contained howling misconceptions, (3) his papers were written in an obscure, “crackpot” way, and (4) several people had written very clear papers pointing out mathematical errors in his work, to which Joy had responded only with bluster. But I hadn’t actually studied Joy’s “work” at a technical level. Well, yesterday I finally did, and I confess that I was astonished by what I found. Before, I’d actually given Joy some tiny benefit of the doubt—possibly misled by the length and semi-respectful tone of the papers refuting his claims. I had assumed that Joy’s errors, though ultimately trivial (how could they not be, when he’s claiming to contradict such a well-understood fact provable with a few lines of arithmetic?), would nevertheless be artfully concealed, and would require some expertise in geometric algebra to spot. I’d also assumed that of course Joy would have some well-defined hidden-variable model that reproduced the quantum-mechanical predictions for the Bell/CHSH experiment (how could he not?), and that the “only” problem would be that, due to cleverly-hidden mistakes, his model would be subtly nonlocal.
What I actually found was a thousand times worse: closer to the stuff freshmen scrawl on an exam when they have no clue what they’re talking about but are hoping for a few pity points. It’s so bad that I don’t understand how even Joy’s fellow crackpots haven’t laughed this off the stage. Look, Joy has a hidden variable λ, which is either 1 or -1 uniformly at random. He also has a measurement choice a of Alice, and a measurement choice b of Bob. He then defines Alice and Bob’s measurement outcomes A and B via the following functions:
A(a,λ) = something complicated = (as Joy correctly observes) λ
B(b,λ) = something complicated = (as Joy correctly observes) -λ
I shit you not. A(a,λ) = λ, and B(b,λ) = -λ. Neither A nor B has any dependence on the choices of measurement a and b, and the complicated definitions that he gives for them turn out to be completely superfluous. No matter what measurements are made, A and B are always perfectly anticorrelated with each other.
You might wonder: what could lead anyone—no matter how deluded—even to think such a thing could violate the Bell/CHSH inequalities? Aha, Joy says you only ask such a naïve question because, lacking his deep topological insight, you make the rookie mistake of looking at the actual outcomes that his model actually predicts for the actual measurements that are actually made. What you should do, instead, is compute a “correlation function” E(a,b) that’s defined by dividing A(a,λ)B(b,λ) by a “normalizing factor” that’s a product of the quaternions a and b, with a divided on the left and b divided on the right. Joy seems to have obtained this “normalizing factor” via the technique of pulling it out of his rear end. Now, as Gill shows, Joy actually makes an algebra mistake while computing his nonsensical “correlation function.” The answer should be -a.b-a×b, not -a.b. But that’s truthfully beside the point. It’s as if someone announced his revolutionary discovery that P=NP implies N=1, and then critics soberly replied that, no, the equation P=NP can also be solved by P=0.
So, after 400+ comments on my previous thread—including heady speculations about M-theory, the topology of spacetime, the Copenhagen interpretation, continuity versus discreteness, etc., as well numerous comparisons to Einstein—this is what it boils down to. A(a,λ) = λ and B(b,λ) = -λ.
I call on FQXi, in the strongest possible terms, to stop lending its legitimacy to this now completely-unmasked charlatan. If it fails to do so, then I will resign from FQXi, and will encourage fellow FQXi members to do the same.
While I don’t know the exact nature of Joy’s relationship to Oxford University or to the Perimeter Institute, I also call on those institutions to sever any connections they still have with him.
Finally, with this post I’m going to try a new experiment. I will allow comments through the moderation filter if, and only if, they exceed a minimum threshold of sanity and comprehensibility, and do not randomly throw around terms like “M-theory” with no apparent understanding of what they mean. Comments below the sanity threshold can continue to appear freely in the previous Joy Christian thread (which already has a record-setting number of comments…).
Update (May 11): A commenter pointed me to a beautiful preprint by James Owen Weatherall, which tries sympathetically to make as much sense as possible out of Joy Christian’s ideas, and then carefully explains why the attempt fails (long story short: because of Bell’s theorem!). Notice the contrast between the precision and clarity of Weatherall’s prose—the way he defines and justifies each concept before using it—and the obscurity of Christian’s prose.
Another Update: Over on the previous Joy Christian thread, some commenters are now using an extremely amusing term for people who believe that theories in physics ought to say something comprehensible about the predicted outcomes of physics experiments. The term: “computer nerd.”
Third Update: Quite a few commenters seem to assume that I inappropriately used my blog to “pick a fight” with poor defenseless Joy Christian, who was minding his own business disproving and re-disproving Bell’s Theorem. So let me reiterate that I wasn’t looking for this confrontation, and in fact took great pains to avoid it for six years, even as Joy became more and more vocal. It was Joy, not me, who finally forced matters to a head through his absurd demand that I pay him $100,000 “with interest,” and then his subsequent attacks.",7547,"['ca765d86b26374c3c93ed05a0cc4bff45a0258d2d582a20e5b5491aea578f381', 'a0a86822541b69c6f6ce34c876c3e368b0498a7cd4d61155848389558a29d9d0',

Yes, that Bell’s theorem: the famous result from the 1960s showing that no local hidden variable theory can reproduce all predictions of quantum mechanics for entangled states of two particles. Here a “local hidden variable theory” means—and has always meant—a theory where Alice gets some classical information x, Bob gets some other classical information y (generally correlated with x), then Alice and Bob choose which respective experiments to perform, and finally Alice sees a measurement outcome that’s a function only of her choice and of x (not of Bob’s choice or his measurement outcome), and Bob sees a measurement outcome that’s a function only of his choice and of y. In modern terms, Bell, with simplifications by Clauser et al., gave an example of a game that Alice and Bob can win at most 75% of the time under any local hidden variable theory (that’s the Bell inequality), but can win 85% of the time by measuring their respective halves of an entangled state (that’s the Bell inequality violation). The proofs are quite easy, both for the inequality and for its violation by quantum mechanics. Check out this problem set for the undergrad course I’m currently teaching if you’d like to be led through the proof yourself (it’s problem 7).
In case you’re wondering: no, Bell’s Theorem has no more been “disproved” than the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, and it will never be, even if papers claiming otherwise are stacked to the moon. Like Gödel’s and Cantor’s Theorems, Bell’s Theorem has long been a lightning rod for incomprehension and even anger; I saw another “disproof” at a conference in 2003, and will doubtless see more in the future. The disproofs invariably rely on personal reinterpretations of the perfectly-clear concept of “local hidden variables,” to smuggle in what would normally be called non-local variables. That smuggling is accompanied by mathematical sleight-of-hand (the more, the better) to disguise the ultimately trivial error.
While I’d say the above—loudly, even—to anyone who asked, I also declined several requests to write a blog post about Joy Christian and his mistakes. His papers had already been refuted ad nauseam by others (incidentally, I find myself in complete agreement with Luboš Motl on this one!), and I saw no need to pile on the poor dude. Having met him, at the Perimeter Institute and at several conferences, I found something poignant and even touching about Joy’s joyless quest. I mean, picture a guy who made up his mind at some point that, let’s say, √2 is actually a rational number, all the mathematicians having been grievously wrong for millennia—and then unironically held to that belief his entire life, heroically withstanding the batterings of reason. Show him why 2=A2/B2 has no solution in positive integers A,B, and he’ll answer that you haven’t understood the very concept of rational number as deeply as him. Ask him what he means by “rational number,” and you’ll quickly enter the territory of the Monty Python dead parrot sketch. So why not just leave this dead parrot where it lies?
Anyway, that’s what I was perfectly content to do, until Monday, when Joy left the following comment on my “Whether or not God plays dice, I do” post:
Scott,
You owe me 100,000 US Dollars plus five years of interest. In 2007, right under your nose (when you and I were both visiting Perimeter Institute), I demonstrated, convincing to me, that scalable quantum computing is impossible in the physical world.
He included a link to his book, in case I wanted to review his arguments against the reality of entanglement. I have to confess I had no idea that, besides disproving Bell’s theorem, Joy had also proved the impossibility of scalable quantum computing. Based on his previous work, I would have expected him to say that, sure, quantum computers could quickly factor 10,000-digit numbers, but nothing about that would go beyond ordinary, classical, polynomial-time Turing machines—because Turing himself got the very definition of Turing machines wrong, by neglecting topological octonion bivectors or something.
Be that as it may, Joy then explained that the purpose of his comment was to show that
there is absolutely nothing that would convince you to part with your 100,000. You know that, and everyone else knows that … The whole thing is just a smug scam to look smarter than the rest of us without having to do the hard work. Good luck with that.
In response, I clarified what it would take to win my bet:
As I’ve said over and over, what would be necessary and sufficient would be to convince the majority of the physics community. Do you hope and expect to do that? If so, then you can expect my $100,000; if not, then not. If a scientific revolution has taken place only inside the revolutionary’s head, then let the monetary rewards be likewise confined to his head.
Joy replied:
[L]et us forget about my work. It is not for you. Instead, let me make a counter offer to you. I will give you 200,000 US dollars the day someone produces an actual, working, quantum computer in a laboratory recognizable by me. If I am still alive, I will send you 200,000 US Dollars, multiplied by an appropriate inflation factor. Go build a quantum computer.
I’m grateful to Joy for his exceedingly generous offer. But let’s forget about money for now. Over the past few months, I’ve had a real insight: the most exciting potential application of scalable quantum computers is neither breaking RSA, nor simulating quantum physics, nor Grover’s algorithm, nor adiabatic optimization. Instead, it’s watching the people who said it was impossible try to explain themselves. That prospect, alone, would more than justify a Manhattan-project-scale investment in this field.
Postscript. If you want something about quantum foundations and hidden-variable theories of a bit more scientific interest, check out this MathOverflow question I asked on Monday, which was answered within one day by George Lowther (I then carefully wrote up the solution he sketched).
Updates (May 6). Depending on what sort of entertainment you enjoy, you might want to check out the comments section, where you can witness Joy Christian becoming increasingly unhinged in his personal attacks on me and others (“our very own FQXi genius” – “biased and closed-minded” – “incompetent” – “Scott’s reaction is a textbook case for the sociologists” – “As for Richard Gill, he is evidently an incompetent mathematician” – “I question your own intellectual abilities” – “your entire world view is based on an experimentally unsupported (albeit lucrative) belief and nothing else” – “You have been caught with your pants down and still refusing to see what is below your belly” – “let me point out that you are the lesser brain among the two of us. The pitiful flatness of your brain would be all too painful for everyone to see when my proposed experiment is finally done” – etc., etc). To which I respond: the flatness of my brain? Also notable is Joy’s Tourette’s-like repetition of the sentence, “I will accept judgement from no man but Nature.” Nature is a man?
I just posted a comment explaining the Bell/CHSH inequality in the simplest terms I know, which I’ll repost here for convenience:
Look everyone, consider the following game. Two players, Alice and Bob, can agree on a strategy in advance, but from that point forward, are out of communication with each other (and don’t share quantum entanglement or anything like that). After they’re separated, Alice receives a uniformly-random bit A, and Bob receives another uniformly-random bit B (uncorrelated with A). Their joint goal is for Alice to output a bit X, and Bob to output a bit Y, such that
X + Y = AB (mod 2)
or equivalently,
X XOR Y = A AND B.
They want to succeed with the largest possible probability. It’s clear that one strategy they can follow is always to output X=Y=0, in which case they’ll win 75% of the time (namely, in all four of the cases except A=B=1).
Furthermore, by enumerating all of Alice and Bob’s possible pure strategies and then appealing to convexity, one can check that there’s no strategy that lets them win more than 75% of the time. In other words, no matter what they do, they lose for one of the four possible (A,B) pairs.
Do you agree with the previous paragraph? If so, then you accept the Bell/CHSH inequality, end of story.
Of all the papers pointing out the errors in Joy Christian’s attempted refutations of the simple arithmetic above, my favorite is Richard Gill’s. Let me quote from Gill’s eloquent conclusion:
There remains a psychological question, why so strong a need is felt by so many researchers to “disprove Bell” in one way or another? At a rough guess, at least one new proposal comes up per year. Many pass by unnoticed, but from time to time one of them attracts some interest and even media attention. Having studied a number of these proposals in depth, I see two main strategies of would-be Bell-deniers.
The first strategy (the strategy, I would guess, in the case in question) is to build elaborate mathematical models of such complexity and exotic nature that the author him or herself is the probably the only person who ever worked through all the details. Somewhere in the midst of the complexity a simple mistake is made, usually resulting from suppression of an important index or variable. There is a hidden and non-local hidden variable.
The second strategy is to simply build elaborate versions of detection loophole models. Sometimes the same proposal can be interpreted in both ways at the same time, since of course either the mistake or the interpretation as a detection loophole model are both interpretations of the reader, not of the writer.
According to the Anna Karenina principle of evolutionary biology, in order for things to succeed, everything has to go exactly right, while for failure, it suffices if any one of a myriad factors is wrong. Since errors are typically accidental and not recognized, an apparently logical deduction which leads to a manifestly incorrect conclusion does not need to allow a unique diagnosis. If every apparently logical step had been taken with explicit citation of the mathematical rule which was being used, and in a specified context, one could say where the first misstep was taken. But mathematics is almost never written like that, and for good reasons. The writer and the reader, coming from the same scientic community, share a host of “hidden assumptions” which can safely be taken for granted, as long as no self-contradiction occurs. Saying that the error actually occurred in such-and-such an equation at such-and-such a substitution depends on various assumptions.
The author who still believes in his result will therefore claim that the diagnosis is wrong because the wrong context has been assumed.
We can be grateful for Christian that he has had the generosity to write his one page paper with a more or less complete derivation of his key result in a more or less completely explicit context, without distraction from the author’s intended physical interpretation of the mathematics. The mathematics should stand on its own, the interpretation is “free”. My finding is that in this case, the mathematics does not stand on its own.
Update (5/7): I can’t think of any better illustration than the comment thread below for my maxim that computation is clarity. In other words, if you can’t explain how to simulate your theory on a computer, chances are excellent that the reason is that your theory makes no sense! The following comment of mine expands on this point:
The central concept that I find missing from the comments of David Brown, James Putnam, and Thomas Ray is that of the sanity check.
Math and computation are simply the tools of clear thought. For example, if someone tells me that a 4-by-4 array of zorks contains 25 zorks in total, and I respond that 4 times 4 is 16, not 25, I’m not going to be impressed if the person then starts waxing poetic about how much more profound the physics of zorks is than my narrow and restricted notions of “arithmetic”. There must be a way to explain the discrepancy even at a purely arithmetical level. If there isn’t, then the zork theory has failed a basic sanity check, and there’s absolutely no reason to study its details further.
Likewise, the fact that Joy can’t explain how to code a computer simulation of (say) his exploding toy ball experiment that would reproduce his predicted Bell/CHSH violation is extremely revealing. This is also a sanity check, and it’s one that Joy flunks. Granted, if he were able to explain his model clearly enough for well-intentioned people to understand how to program it on a computer, then almost certainly there would be no need to actually run the program! We could probably just calculate what the program did using pencil and paper. Nevertheless, Bram, John Sidles, and others were entirely right to harp on this simulation question, because its real role is as a sanity check. If Joy’s ideas are not meaningless nonsense, then there’s no reason at all why we shouldn’t be able to simulate his experiment on a computer and get exactly the outcome that he predicts. Until Joy passes this minimal sanity check—which he hasn’t—there’s simply no need to engage in deep ruminations like the ones above about physics or philosophy or Joy’s “Theorema Egregious.”",13464,"['95d8a7616633a725279028dd67e38afe63b143efd876ac2273153adf0f3a41a0', '0e5987f223f3cc491d62b2bf40f24285d8df34f293dc61391a0a99706e286e00',

194,954,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=954,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2012-02-22,Scott Aaronson,My visit to D-Wave: Beyond the roast-beef sandwich,"Last week I was in Vancouver, to give talks at the University of British Columbia and at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting. As part of that visit, on Friday afternoon, John Preskill, John Martinis, Michael Freedman and I accepted a gracious invitation to tour the headquarters of D-Wave Systems in Burnaby (a suburb of Vancouver). We started out in a conference room, where they served us cookies and sodas. Being the mature person that I am, the possibility of the cookies being poisoned at no point crossed my mind.
Then we started the tour of D-Wave’s labs. We looked under a microscope at the superconducting chips; we saw the cooling systems used to get the chips down to 20 millikelvin. In an experience that harked back to the mainframe era, we actually walked inside the giant black cubes that D-Wave was preparing for shipment. (The machines are so large partly because of the need for cooling, and partly to let engineers go in and fix things.) Afterwards, D-Wave CTO Geordie Rose gave a 2-hour presentation about their latest experimental results. Then we all went out to dinner. The D-Wave folks were extremely cordial to us and fielded all of our questions.
In spite of my announcement almost a year ago that I was retiring as Chief D-Wave Skeptic, I thought it would be fitting to give Shtetl-Optimized readers an update on what I learned from this visit. I’ll start with three factual points before moving on to larger issues.
Point #1: D-Wave now has a 128-(qu)bit machine that can output approximate solutions to a particular NP-hard minimization problem—namely, the problem of minimizing the energy of 90-100 Ising spins with pairwise interactions along a certain fixed graph (the “input” to the machine being the tunable interaction strengths). So I hereby retire my notorious comment from 2007, about the 16-bit machine that D-Wave used for its Sudoku demonstration being no more computationally-useful than a roast-beef sandwich. D-Wave does have something today that’s more computationally-useful than a roast-beef sandwich; the question is “merely” whether it’s ever more useful than your laptop. Geordie presented graphs that showed D-Wave’s quantum annealer solving its Ising spin problem “faster” than classical simulated annealing and tabu search (where “faster” means ignoring the time for cooling the annealer down, which seemed fair to me). Unfortunately, the data didn’t go up to large input sizes, while the data that did go up to large input sizes only compared against complete classical algorithms rather than heuristic ones. (Of course, all this is leaving aside the large blowups that would likely be incurred in practice, from reducing practical optimization problems to D-Wave’s fixed Ising spin problem.) In summary, while the observed speedup is certainly interesting, it remains unclear exactly what to make of it, and especially, whether or not quantum coherence is playing a role.
Which brings me to Point #2. It remains true, as I’ve reiterated here for years, that we have no direct evidence that quantum coherence is playing a role in the observed speedup, or indeed that entanglement between qubits is ever present in the system. (Note that, if there’s no entanglement, then it becomes extremely implausible that quantum coherence could be playing a role in a speedup. For while separable-mixed-state quantum computers are not yet known to be efficiently simulable classically, we certainly don’t have any examples where they give a speedup.) Last year, as reported on this blog, D-Wave had a nice Nature paper that reported quantum tunneling behavior in an 8-qubit system. However, when I asked D-Wave scientist Mohammad Amin, he said he didn’t think that experiment provided any evidence for entanglement between qubits.
The “obvious” way to demonstrate entanglement between qubits would be to show a Bell inequality violation. (We know that this can be done in superconducting qubits, as the Schoelkopf group at Yale among others reported it a couple years ago.) Meanwhile, the “obvious” way to demonstrate a role for quantum coherence in the apparent speedup would be gradually to “turn down” the system’s coherence (for example, by adding an interaction that constantly measured the qubits in the computational basis), and check that the annealer’s performance degraded to that of classical simulated annealing. Unfortunately, the D-Wave folks told us that neither experiment seems feasible with their current setup, basically because they don’t have arbitrary local unitary transformations and measurements available. They said they want to try to demonstrate 2-qubit entanglement, but in the meantime, are open to other ideas for how to demonstrate a quantum role in the apparent speedup with their existing setup.
Point #3: D-Wave was finally able to clarify a conceptual point that had been bugging me for years. I—and apparently many others!—thought D-Wave was claiming that their qubits decohere almost immediately (so that, in particular, entanglement would almost certainly never be present during the computation), but that the lack of entanglement didn’t matter, for some complicated reason having to do with energy gaps. I was far from alone in regarding such a claim as incredible: as mentioned earlier, there’s no evidence that a quantum computer without entanglement can solve any problem asymptotically faster than a classical computer. However, that isn’t D-Wave’s claim. What they think is that their system decoheres almost immediately in the energy eigenbasis, but that it doesn’t decohere in the computational basis—so that, in particular, there would be entanglement at intermediate stages. If so, that would be perfectly fine from the standpoint of the adiabatic algorithm, which doesn’t need coherence in the energy eigenbasis anyway (after all, the whole point is that, throughout the computation, you want to stay as close to the system’s ground state as possible!). I understand that, given their knowledge of decoherence mechanisms, some physicists are extremely skeptical that you could have rapid decoherence in the energy basis without getting decoherence in the computational basis also. So certainly the burden is on D-Wave to demonstrate that they maintain coherence “where it counts.” But at least I now understand what they’re claiming, and how it would be compatible (if true) with a quantum speedup.
Let me now move on to three broader questions raised by the above points.
The first is: rather than constantly adding more qubits and issuing more hard-to-evaluate announcements, while leaving the scientific characterization of its devices in a state of limbo, why doesn’t D-Wave just focus all its efforts on demonstrating entanglement, or otherwise getting stronger evidence for a quantum role in the apparent speedup? When I put this question to Mohammad Amin, he said that, if D-Wave had followed my suggestion, it would have published some interesting research papers and then gone out of business—since the fundraising pressure is always for more qubits and more dramatic announcements, not for clearer understanding of its systems. So, let me try to get a message out to the pointy-haired bosses of the world: a single qubit that you understand is better than a thousand qubits that you don’t. There’s a reason why academic quantum computing groups focus on pushing down decoherence and demonstrating entanglement in 2, 3, or 4 qubits: because that way, at least you know that the qubits are qubits! Once you’ve shown that the foundation is solid, then you try to scale up. So, please support D-Wave if it wants to spend money to show Bell inequality violations, or other “smoking-gun” evidence that its qubits are working together coherently. You’re welcome, D-Wave!
The second question is one that I’ve encountered many times on the blogosphere: who cares how D-Wave’s system works, and whether it does or doesn’t exploit quantum coherence, as long as it solves practical problems faster? Sure, maybe what D-Wave is building is really a series of interesting, useful, but still basically “classical” annealing devices. Maybe the word “quantum” is functioning here as the stone in a stone soup: attracting money, interest, and talented people to build something that, while neat, ultimately doesn’t much depend on quantum mechanics at all. As long as D-Wave’s (literal!) black box solves the problem instances in such-and-such amount of time, why does it matter what’s inside?
To see the obtuseness of this question, consider a simple thought experiment: suppose D-Wave were marketing a classical, special-purpose, $10-million computer designed to perform simulated annealing, for 90-bit Ising spin glass problems with a certain fixed topology, somewhat better than an off-the-shelf computing cluster. Would there be even 5% of the public interest that there is now? I think D-Wave itself would be the first to admit the answer is no. Indeed, Geordie Rose spoke explicitly in his presentation about the compelling nature of (as he put it) “the quantum computing story,” and how it was key to attracting investment. People don’t care about this stuff because they want to find the ground states of Ising spin systems a bit faster; they care because they want to know whether or not the human race has finally achieved a new form of computing. So characterizing the device matters, goddammit! I pride myself on being willing to adjust my opinions on just about anything in response to new data (as I’ve certainly done in D-Wave’s case), but the insistence that black boxes must be opened and explanations provided is something I’ll carry to the grave.
Finally, given the skeptical-yet-positive tone of this post, some people will wonder whether I now regret my earlier, more unmitigated D-Wave skepticism. The answer is no! Asking questions is my job. I’ll give D-Wave credit whenever it answers some of the questions—as it did on this visit!—and will shift my views accordingly. But I’ll also neither stop asking nor apologize for asking, until the evidence for a quantum speedup becomes clear and indisputable (as it certainly hasn’t yet). On the other hand, I do regret the snowballing nastiness that developed as a combined result of my and other skeptics’ statements, D-Wave’s and its supporters’ statements, and the adversarial nature of the blogosphere. For the first time, I find myself really, genuinely hoping—with all my heart—that D-Wave will succeed in proving that it can do some (not necessarily universal) form of scalable quantum computation. For, if nothing else, such a success would prove to the world that my $100,000 is safe, and decisively refute the QC skeptics who, right now, are getting even further under my skin than the uncritical D-Wave boosters ever did.",10819,"['d0219c5f031e0d16ea4b705fadb9c95a687a53f1a93eeb5abe997329dc4f30cb', 'a1333cef8235ce49ba677b9696e108f2805fee4e68153a38cb39e1c62ed56987', 'b222e2a4302ce5aaf25c301cc6874a10f5a834c57a1122f5d9e1ad4be8f88d15', '608653d256c931a24bc5694b24960c83722e9c7057b571631b86e67602793b4e', 'dfdb4f37e38539c7699cd46d5e79eda4d3f653b8e2c2437db759fffb029c8a73', '5feb649e39c20a801b3b5ab9ade8b699e819e65b0d600de0128e8c7702a9581f', '636a6414580b0c77b31ab98287c68c065b12f02453a25f48e64482a2ce74b697', '8d06e196919b5ff73627adb13e3b0e5e081c58256c7514d375d2de3fa7904482', 'd7a0434e0487e49e03d26861d07a84bcf59cefc640c8f1881dad044f06250b73', 'c61887437cdad7e9e1cda57ea9fc61e6cacb34cd89123cb20f421671bf019c37', 'ad2275799d68593d97d930d1965c8012c6fea35ee852ba5a03e661a0f6462aaa', '69298ef737d95462acfbd3e14bf2792254b88ab85d1867384c895a1fc26aa9d9', '83bf95c04227d6149a42d8cfe838e248b070166b731dc9c1108bd54946a9bb2d', 'dcf15b670abd3f0ae273fa2c04a461507b7a5c94715a5a18fddfed20c72eb059', '9300f228a4bc625c7c3bff4303100ec2b7166969fb27675db3d611426dd83ab9', '50f10f333c20065070770d9e9b0defdc779ea85af88b7e80d0923ca31355ca78', '706a6011590a369017b9be67ce0e76c023af538d8f61315e6db7f1928ac52c0b', '93aac63cf9805a4df415f2ca97e49cf98ff6afce0d6a62d62c653816501ca68c', 'f3e6aedaeebcc86be291b37f58e755ce389a21f28ed467183512f4d65b9a5efb', 'd3253bbb2948512d6912323aa16975beb6c9552a9efc9dbdeb4101dc53833367', '5d074136105f43282d749fc5b2603cc903f85939915717e5e37258e2ada3b8b8', '00ae2939007bec5379647bdf900d2d3dca60c7fd24044f251b3e3a52807daa30', '83046cd98c96de539279867003bfeb95256cdebf4bd35fb71026180a1a7feca2', '88877d4b00641c781e6c758b90ee327b3c21e11562a79471c53149dc885fffd8', '8f0496dfb76b6811015aad1045f666db73f0796dd747095884dd5e7ef8d1f167', 'c638b50bc7ebfbc23337012f4550cbabed42679dfd479758dcc517c846b20072', '6bf902866db8ce25caef10beab3d874f0b30c52762b468d8dd90967ba5550a1b', '207bda00707c6fcf0532db6770050c6408858babb243da15e254502e11b25629', '035e5a4bf8a7998fd55a4d51dc6b9c7fe0f3f7d9afeeef47295411fd40c8d21f', '40e81d6d748577f63417688372126b64e56db0d0f1864b1bc774cce70f9381be', 'c221090e119b3daa908b962e84b748ffcdf0c178a175b607d45b583f55964d8b', '999361115d2cc6cea32c66dd1fcd652e48af39b6daf3c21fc0a26e09c9df6935', '96ff3156742efc57150577d943f0d6a20219ee5630cf34691a7c95a727e22380', '0cff475cd09c35f43ec71ed1e744d8761af8f9bc14c5f6d26d94e9c045819a02', 'dfddcaff9a845c6be018fd1dc29735068eb2fcff5fce44dbb9e151456ebf1332', '14d939c0c923c15d8078fb8cdc55bf29cafe4756d11be79a3138c1fba1c188de', 'a4e58885b09e2ce92fb7ffeea03391979892c36cb62c6d49f5d6f68bce4fea1a', '8c97594f8253e81ee849b959ace133a0f974de26752e181bdf9c8f1ae4917216', 'aceabcd37641316c833ce64a6b78d10ba471dda20e694c7efb61d2b598f94904', '876ddb8972ecdcf5662212d95527450f56cf5f7b7553e159a0dd5b92507cac5a', '2689370f7789ec28fc97260b7769f6183a114d2c26d25bcfd23852b2225cdce1', '09eb4218a19a5a75a35b948308bbafdaf92f777a3c5409e866eac1697cc2c232', 'cec45aee8da974fdd9dad47ea8550b478ea10a9a94426598b5bbfa26f1f247af', '6a66adf4f0cc0d7b8f00a3e49e472cff4058dd471ddd91d0f80962457b7329f7', '0e87424c26cbc58b6c54a848e8e1cd8b57229515ac46af619ed83a21a542caba', '842477cd65a8c66b432e8f922366badca7e51f5f321bed8559830a91601f37f2', 'f0f01f19a901fc8636224238fd1edb5ad8314c29407971cab7ba6d78c082fbf4', '821fb4ec192879be21b6bf6c015ef7a80aedf2b1a9c121e6177eb9dd7607ae9f', 'efdebbee86c940460adda819f39b6581e0b775e0ffe622bd6d8ae43b76b50c02', 'bb7fed7bd4394604d82c92c85d962613963b7c485bbe1d93b4a31e92ed6dc0b8', '2ac04efb82697e6656997ccec3f3eaaebc3eba5f4deb8c2b4f80dbefae990233', 'df0cf8a29d6910f6feeb10438086300af45ca980b8044b78edcf835196a7f1ec', '0ba8399439abc258009e680ca2399a869dac4ca51da89c3d2dd2618b61a77f07', '77a21203648451a49019fb7933eea5758e75905036113f7f54e8326e2d12b255', '89606e730a99393a8c672219a5052f78d777d7267e0e3d575352836a8e8795c8', 'efdebbee86c940460adda819f39b6581e0b775e0ffe622bd6d8ae43b76b50c02', 'eef5095a167ddeaf705a0724575e1a609658e4ebce36d1e0aa2547aef7f6cfba']"
195,902,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=902,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2012-02-03,Scott Aaronson,"Whether or not God plays dice, I do","Another Update (Feb. 7): I have a new piece up at IEEE Spectrum, explaining why I made this bet. Thanks to Rachel Courtland for soliciting the piece and for her suggestions improving it.
Update: My $100,000 offer for disproving scalable quantum computing has been Slashdotted. Reading through the comments was amusing as always. The top comment suggested that winning my prize was trivial: “Just point a gun at his head and ask him ‘Convinced?'” (For the record: no, I wouldn’t be, even as I handed over my money. And if you want to be a street thug, why limit yourself to victims who happen to have made public bets about quantum computing?) Many people assumed I was a QC skeptic, and was offering the prize because I hoped to spur research aimed at disproving QC. (Which is actually an interesting misreading: I wonder how much “pro-paranormal” research has been spurred by James Randi’s million-dollar prize?) Other people said the bet was irrelevant since D-Wave has already built scalable QCs. (Oh, how I wish I could put the D-Wave boosters and the QC deniers in the same room, and let them duke it out with each other while leaving me alone for a while!) One person argued that it would be easy to prove the impossibility of scalable QCs, just like it would’ve been easy to prove the impossibility of scalable classical computers in 1946: the only problem is that both proofs would then be invalidated by advances in technology. (I think he understands the word “proof” differently than I do.) Then, buried deep in the comments, with a score of 2 out of 5, was one person who understood precisely:
I think he’s saying that while a general quantum computer might be a very long way off, the underlying theory that allows such a thing to exist is on very solid ground (which is why he’s putting up the money). Of course this prize might still cost him since if the news of the prize goes viral he’s going to spend the next decade getting spammed by kooks.
OK, two people:
- There’s some needed context. Aaronson himself works on quantum complexity theory. Much of his work deals with quantum computers (at a conceptual level–what is and isn’t possible). Yet there are some people who reject the idea the quantum computers can scale to “useful” sizes–including some very smart people like Leonid Levin (of Cook-Levin Theorem fame)–and some of them send him email, questions, comments on his blog, etc. saying so. These people are essentially asserting that Aaronson’s career is rooted in things that can’t exist. Thus, Aaronson essentially said “prove it.” It’s true that proving such a statement would be very difficult … But the context is that Aaronson gets mail and questions all the time from people who simply assert that scalable QC is impossible, and he’s challenging them to be more formal about it. He also mentions, in fairness, that if he does have to pay out, he’d consider it an honor, because it would be a great scientific advance.
For better or worse, I’m now offering a US$100,000 award for a demonstration, convincing to me, that scalable quantum computing is impossible in the physical world. This award has no time limit other than my death, and is entirely at my discretion (though if you want to convince me, a good approach would be to convince most of the physics community first). I might, also at my discretion, decide to split the award among several people or groups, or give a smaller award for a discovery that dramatically weakens the possibility of scalable QC while still leaving it open. I don’t promise to read every claimed refutation of QC that’s emailed to me. Indeed, you needn’t even bother to send me your refutation directly: just convince most of the physics community, and believe me, I’ll hear about it! The prize amount will not be adjusted for inflation.
The impetus for this prize was a post on Dick Lipton’s blog, entitled “Perpetual Motion of the 21st Century?” (See also this followup post.) The post consists of a debate between well-known quantum-computing skeptic Gil Kalai and well-known quantum-computing researcher Aram Harrow (Shtetl-Optimized commenters both), about the assumptions behind the Quantum Fault-Tolerance Theorem. So far, the debate covers well-trodden ground, but I understand that it will continue for a while longer. Anyway, in the comments section of the post, I pointed out that a refutation of scalable QC would require, not merely poking this or that hole in the Fault-Tolerance Theorem, but the construction of a dramatically-new, classically-efficiently-simulable picture of physical reality: something I don’t expect but would welcome as the scientific thrill of my life. Gil more-or-less dared me to put a large cash prize behind my words—as I’m now, apparently, known for doing!—and I accepted his dare.
To clarify: no, I don’t expect ever to have to pay the prize, but that’s not, by itself, a sufficient reason for offering it. After all, I also don’t expect Newt to win the Republican primary, but I’m not ready to put $100,000 on the line for that belief. The real reason to offer this prize is that, if I did have to pay, at least doing so would be an honor: for I’d then (presumably) simply be adding a little to the well-deserved Nobel Prize coffers of one of the greatest revolutionaries in the history of physics.
Over on Lipton’s blog, my offer was criticized for being “like offering $100,000 to anyone who can prove that Bigfoot doesn’t exist.” To me, though, that completely misses the point. As I wrote there, whether Bigfoot exists is a question about the contingent history of evolution on Earth. By contrast, whether scalable quantum computing is possible is a question about the laws of physics. It’s perfectly conceivable that future developments in physics would conflict with scalable quantum computing, in the same way that relativity conflicts with faster-than-light communication, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics conflicts with perpetuum mobiles. It’s for such a development in physics that I’m offering this prize.
Update: If anyone wants to offer a counterpart prize for a demonstration that scalable quantum computing is possible, I’ll be happy for that—as I’m sure, will many experimental QC groups around the world. I’m certainly not offering such a prize.",6280,"['671454af86a1a187e1b10843477c4d8debd91af14bb0e449b66335c885af668b', 'bc4fc65fdf2ed78ea34143a407348485bc3819de9f9f831f8a17f4b30abd0df5',

(My original title was “The Real Reasons to Study Quantum Computing.”) This piece is part of a collection of essays on “the future of computing,” which include one on self-driving cars by Sebastian Thrun, one on online learning by Daphne Koller, and other interesting stuff (the full list is here).
In writing my essay, the basic constraints were:
(a) I’d been given a rare opportunity to challenge at least ten popular misconceptions about quantum computing, and would kick myself for years if I didn’t hit all of them,
(b) I couldn’t presuppose the reader had heard of quantum computing, and
(c) I had 1200 words.
Satisfying these constraints was harder than it looked, and I benefited greatly from the feedback of friends and colleagues, as well as the enormously helpful Times staff. I did get one request that floored me: namely, to remove all the material about “interference” and “amplitudes” (too technical), and replace it by something ordinary people could better relate to—like, say, a description of how a quantum computer would work by trying every possible answer in parallel. Eventually, though, the Gray Lady and I found a compromise that everyone liked (and that actually improved the piece): namely, I’d first summarize the usual “try all answers in parallel” view, and then explain why it was wrong, bringing in the minus signs and Speaking Truth to Parallelism.
To accompany the essay, I also did a short podcast interview about quantum computing with the Times‘ David Corcoran. (My part starts around 8:20.) Overall, I’m happy with the interview, but be warned: when Corcoran asks me what quantum computers’ potential is, I start talking about the “try all answers in parallel” misconception—and then they cut to the next question before I get to the part about its being a misconception! I need to get better at delivering soundbites…
One final comment: in case you’re wondering, those black spots on the Times‘ cartoon of me seem to be artifacts of whatever photo-editing software they used.

198,862,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=862,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2011-12-03,Scott Aaronson,Quantum Algorithms for Quantum Field Theories,"For weeks, I’ve been meaning to blog about an important recent paper by Stephen Jordan, Keith Lee, and John Preskill, entitled Quantum Algorithms for Quantum Field Theories. So I’m now doing so.
As long as I’ve been in quantum computing, people have been wondering aloud about the computational power of realistic quantum field theories (for example, the Standard Model of elementary particles). But no one seemed to have any detailed analysis of this question (if there’s something I missed, surely commenters will let me know). The “obvious” guess would be that realistic quantum field theories should provide exactly the same computational power as “ordinary,” nonrelativistic quantum mechanics—in other words, the power of BQP (the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a quantum computer). That would be analogous to the situation in classical physics, where bringing in special relativity dramatically changes our understanding of space, time, matter, and energy, but seems (unlike quantum mechanics) to have little or no effect on which computational problems can be solved efficiently. Analogously, it would seem strange if quantum field theories (QFTs)—which tie together quantum mechanics, special relativity, and detailed knowledge about the elementary particles and their interactions, but seen from far enough away are “just” quantum mechanics—forced any major revision to quantum computing theory.
Until now, though, there seems to have been only one detailed analysis supporting that conclusion, and it applied to (2+1)-dimensional topological QFTs (TQFTs) only, rather than “realistic” (3+1)-dimensional QFTs. This was the seminal work of Freedman, Kitaev, and Wang and Freedman, Larsen, and Wang in 2000. (Six years later, Aharonov, Jones, and Landau gave a more computer-science-friendly version, by directly proving the BQP-completeness of approximating the Jones polynomial at roots of unity. The latter problem was known to be closely-related to simulating TQFTs, from the celebrated work of Witten and others in the 1980s.) To a theoretical computer scientist, dropping from three to two spatial dimensions might not sound like a big deal, but what’s important is that the relevant degrees of freedom become “topological”, making possible a clean, simple model of computation. For “realistic” QFTs, by contrast, it wasn’t even obvious how to define a model of computation; putting realistic QFTs on a rigorous mathematical footing remains a notorious open problem.
In their new paper, Jordan, Lee, and Preskill say that they give an algorithm, running on a “conventional” quantum computer, to estimate scattering probabilities in a class of QFTs called “continuum φ4 theories.” Their algorithm uses time polynomial in the number of incoming particles in the scattering experiment and in their total energy, and inversely polynomial in the desired precision ε and in the distance λ-λc between the QFT’s coupling constant λ and a phase transition λc. (In d=2 spatial dimensions, they say the dependence on the precision scales like (1/ε)2.376, the 2.376 coming from matrix multiplication. Naturally, that should now be amended to (1/ε)2.373.) To develop their algorithm, Jordan et al. apparently had to introduce some new techniques for coping with the error incurred by discretizing QFTs. No classical algorithm is known with similar scaling—so when suitably formalized, the “QFT simulation problem” might indeed be in BQP-BPP, matching the uninformed doofus intuition of complexity theorists like me. Jordan et al. don’t say whether the problem they’re solving is also BQP-complete; I imagine that could be a topic for future research. They also don’t say whether their precision parameter ε bounds the variation distance between the real and simulated output distributions (rather than just the differences between probabilities of individual scattering outcomes); I hope they or someone else will be able to clarify that point.
In case it isn’t obvious yet, let me make it crystal-clear that I lack the physics background to evaluate Jordan et al.’s work in a serious technical way. All I can say with confidence is that the small number of people who (1) have the requisite background and (2) care about computational complexity, will probably spend non-negligible time discussing and understanding this paper in the weeks and months to come.
Conflict-of-Interest Warning: At a deep, subconscious level, I probably chose to blog about Jordan et al.’s paper not for any legitimate scientific reason, but simply because I know John Preskill and Stephen Jordan personally, and, despite being physicists, they’re both tremendously-respected colleagues who’ve made many outstanding contributions to quantum computing theory besides this one. Then again, everything I’ve ever done—and everything you’ve ever done—has probably had such unsavory hidden motives as well, so who’s counting?

199,822,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=822,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2011-11-19,Scott Aaronson,The quantum state cannot be interpreted as something other than a quantum state,"Lots of people asked me to comment on a much-discussed new preprint by Matthew Pusey, Jonathan Barrett, and Terry Rudolph (henceforth PBR), “The quantum state cannot be interpreted statistically”. (See here for an effusive Nature News article, here for the predictable Slashdot confusion-fest, here for a related Cosmic Variance guest post by David Wallace, and here for a spiteful rant by Lubos Motl that hilariously misunderstands the new result as “anti-quantum-mechanics.”)
I recommend reading the preprint if you haven’t done so yet; it should only take an hour. PBR’s main result reminds me a little of the No-Cloning Theorem: it’s a profound triviality, something that most people who thought about quantum mechanics already knew, but probably didn’t know they knew. (Some people are even making comparisons to Bell’s Theorem, but to me, the PBR result lacks the same surprise factor.)
To understand the new result, the first question we should ask is, what exactly do PBR mean by a quantum state being “statistically interpretable”? Strangely, PBR spend barely a paragraph justifying their answer to this central question—but it’s easy enough to explain what their answer is. Basically, PBR call something “statistical” if two people, who live in the same universe but have different information, could rationally disagree about it. (They put it differently, but I’m pretty sure that’s what they mean.) As for what “rational” means, all we’ll need to know is that a rational person can never assign a probability of 0 to something that will actually happen.
To illustrate, suppose a coin is flipped, and you (but not I) get a tip from a reliable source that the coin probably landed heads. Then you and I will describe the coin using different probability distributions, but neither of us will be “wrong” or “irrational”, given the information we have.
In quantum mechanics, mixed states—the most general type of state—have exactly the same observer-relative property. That isn’t surprising, since mixed states include classical probability distributions as a special case. As I understand it, it’s this property of mixed states, more than anything else, that’s encouraged many people (especially in and around the Perimeter Institute) to chant slogans like “quantum states are states of knowledge, not states of nature.”
By contrast, pure states—states with perfect quantum coherence—seem intuitively much more “objective.” Concretely, suppose I describe a physical system using a pure state |ψ>, and you describe the same system using a different pure state |φ>≠|ψ>. Then it seems obvious that at least one of us has to be flat-out wrong, our confidence misplaced! In other words, at least one of us should’ve assigned a mixed state rather than a pure state. The PBR result basically formalizes and confirms that intuition.
In the special case that |ψ> and |φ> are orthogonal, the conclusion is obvious: we can just measure the system in a basis containing |ψ> and |φ>. If we see outcome |ψ> then you’re “unmasked as irrational”, while if we see outcome |φ>, then I’m unmasked as irrational.
So let’s try a slightly more interesting, non-orthogonal example. Suppose I describe a system S using the state |0>, while you describe it using the state |+>=(|0>+|1>)/√2. Even then, there are some measurements and outcomes of those measurements that would clearly reveal one of us to have been irrational. If we measure S in the {|0>,|1>} basis and get outcome |1>, then I was irrational. If we measure in the {|+>,|->} basis (where |->=(|0>-|1>)/√2) and get outcome |->, then you were irrational. Furthermore, if S is any qubit that obeys quantum mechanics, then it must have a decent probability either of returning outcome |1> when measured in the {|0>,|1>} basis, or of returning outcome |-> when measured in the {|+>,|->} basis.
So, are we finished? Well, PBR don’t discuss the simple argument above, but I assume they wouldn’t be satisfied with it. In particular, they’d probably point out that it only unmasks one of us as irrational for some measurement outcomes—but who can say what the measurement outcome will be, especially if we don’t presuppose that the quantum state provides a complete description of reality?
What they want instead is a measurement that’s guaranteed to unmask someone as irrational, regardless of its outcome. PBR show that this can be obtained, under one further assumption: that “rational beliefs behave well under tensor products.” More concretely, suppose two people with different knowledge could rationally describe the same physical system S using different pure states, say |0> or |+> respectively. Then if we consider a new system T, consisting of two independent copies of S, it should be rationally possible to describe T using any of the four states |0>|0>, |0>|+>, |+>|0>, or |+>|+>. But now, PBR point out that there’s a 2-qubit orthonormal basis where the first vector is orthogonal to |0>|0>, the second vector is orthogonal to |0>|+>, the third vector is orthogonal to |+>|0>, and the fourth vector is orthogonal to |+>|+>. So, if we measure in that basis, then someone will get unmasked as irrational regardless of the measurement result.
More generally, given any physical system S that you and I describe using different pure states |ψ> and |φ>, PBR define a new system T consisting of k independent copies of S, where k is inversely proportional to the angle between |ψ> and |φ>. They then construct a projective measurement M on T such that, whichever of M’s 2k possible outcomes is observed, one of the 2k possible “tensor product beliefs” about T gets unmasked as irrational. And that’s it (well, other than a generalization to the noisy case).
So, will this theorem finally end the century-old debate about the “reality” of quantum states—proving, with mathematical certitude, that the “ontic” camp was right and the “epistemic” camp was wrong? To ask this question is to answer it.
(Clarification added for Lubos Motl and anyone else unwilling or unable to understand: The answer that I intended was “no.” I don’t think the battle between the “ontic” and “epistemic” camps can ever be won, by its nature. Nor has that particular battle ever interested me greatly, except insofar as some interesting mathematical results have come out of it.)
I expect that PBR’s philosophical opponents are already hard at work on a rebuttal paper: “The quantum state can too be interpreted statistically”, or even “The quantum state must be interpreted statistically.”
I expect the rebuttal to say that, yes, obviously two people can’t rationally assign different pure states to the same physical system—but only a fool would’ve ever thought otherwise, and that’s not what anyone ever meant by calling quantum states “statistical”, and anyway it’s beside the point, since pure states are just a degenerate special case of the more fundamental mixed states.
I expect the rebuttal to prove a contrary theorem, using a definition of the word “statistical” that subtly differs from PBRs. I expect the difference between the two definitions to get buried somewhere in the body of the paper.
I expect the rebuttal to get blogged and Slashdotted. I expect the Slashdot entry to get hundreds of comments taking strong sides, not one of which will acknowledge that the entire dispute hinges on the two camps’ differing definitions.
There’s an important lesson here for mathematicians, theoretical computer scientists, and analytic philosophers. You want the kind of public interest in your work that the physicists enjoy? Then stop being so goddamned precise with words! The taxpayers who fund us—those who pay attention at all, that is—want a riveting show, a grand Einsteinian dispute about what is or isn’t real. Who wants some mathematical spoilsport telling them: “Look, it all depends what you mean by ‘real.’ If you mean, uniquely determined by the complete state of the universe, and if you’re only talking about pure states, then…”
One final remark. In their conclusion, PBR write:
… the quantum state has the striking property of being an exponentially complicated object. Specifically, the number of real parameters needed to specify a quantum state is exponential in the number of systems n. This has a consequence for classical simulation of quantum systems. If a simulation is constrained by our assumptions—that is, if it must store in memory a state for a quantum system, with independent preparations assigned uncorrelated states—then it will need an amount of memory which is exponential in the number of quantum systems.
The above statement is certainly true, but it seems to me that it was already demonstrated—and much more convincingly—by (for example) the exponential separations between randomized and quantum communication complexities.",8800,"['69ef1f5d021e8ce02a51941675ed463c89ce067866fd66adbf10d67ab1562995', '9e4b280e2629bde09f26297ddbe0b5f82e1a02c57163b527709dbe04ae445734', '78f28ad01b99fc48ed554d6395640c07095e900823ca3e475bc2dbacbb9432fd', 'c65e9c40c4e9fb074bf510580539ac6d6e423ed8056ab9e6fd3b600c42df300b', 'f9efce58360268837fe45490810aa35f3eba2eafb96bc1f82eab53fa2a085a0c', '220f05146aee0c6ba31a6299d62f3e83a017089512656b2e9443d67b322b560f', '1541abd4e78a48ef21abc48cfb13eddfe2748f1a3bce8f8e601eb7c396c9653a', '8110ec89a27b4b1fdf264db6a6a25c24e9ff8e72d6862f87349ad9fa3dc42ab0', 'e359b92cca506ec44cddb1f31b764b091887df59606366bf5902aad5baafd909', '6b021642cf39e2e32f3e43998087524440c515c28bf369d909af2948eeeff554', 'ec848ee62adfd785ddb891258dbabf7d7a1d83271d72599245c1a2bfca3bd650', '56f3f338cb02110bc5947fc0521243099e3e6b50beee4c38b559db5bcccf3a35', 'b1889e495ca59e15913f7810794f9a6f50219596f4b2c2096ed650cd22b8d4bc', '838a94eac466b35aede6f3703e5f91f2c8b0894d86edbd09c9baa2aa4b47d505', 'd489b1d54d0f8999f7fa72b1d80c3c14c1c6688e1881af4644b453cb83e204cb', 'cfd23aa1bb13f6662605072ac24fa85c8e02bfec7a60e40da51b082edef19a90', '1c635c291c4eac40eebb2fdb9257cca66be3b693704b11fa017064020ca9b214', '7df4d101d28db93772e41e4e3835db71f0bc8d5cba884d284f2ed7e03995dba5', '05c1e1cd2294897ce2e4fba2248203832bdea35700443a4e426ed459d0d32892', 'c8a95d8c78caaaf11845c238d7833adfafae6e2ec6e5a1d29f55a4a8db764af7', 'd7ddf875a1aefcef04b295a482f6c463438a0c559075122c219de2c052aa2622', '92a60640796239332ca4e9781747a4bd54334bb3461c244aa97bac514d91141f', '00266ccac612de5a7f9a183f1cc899abdb5eed8361d2546bd27dffaed8afa22d', 'e64d2c8f5b85fb062d58d38312e0bc04e45b730760d61dad7118cf6b5bd6493d', '324b0198866737b2a06d2d1e6d6ffb38ab9c8ca2bd0d7f59e051191f8ad11f01', '53154c0cb7c745e02d248fa8497e3391cf66f1a38e21facea87e33e82d22c352', 'c2328c70118969cd9af5984cf58a0c2090b6f9c786060868c2be408603553ddc', 'c404d188427c6208e2a4f680eb835db61f70582f772159216f47129abf5871e2', '3bbf1815b3b6017aabba86d08b8dfcd56043a2384ced0b6bb233aed77be1c24d', 'da008ffa027a87a752e4f4b46e7a80a69189541453df837707a2369e71b3f607', '44a5a082d464477f7563853da69dfd954cba3bba42ee0aa9e4b4cd278936b501', 'dda8d2ef33672110f2915a236138449fd14268ebcc1e795e0bab9961f11005ca', '333ab967d2027445bb28cfeb91367b488b405c045f3a3b31269c4e33d5a0b7d4', '38f561917d2decdad75792f175033cceb1d9b94f2048a6c7652aec51db8d693a', '14ada7e22f60485e11af844bb8e16e6ca7a9e543eb11da11d8f1d529dce7636e', '62c1d109f07b0d11315cf2e708f636110b9ad995df1fa60320cbc76666e493fe', '4a308924b9d80ecca78d4acbb7cac78aae9886746ba9e1c06f1727397d4f9f5a', '2968b3b8c8e808af574981653c1a2ba76767c448343a7413c49c81e7679ca3b7', 'dd1dfb17b5d7497de75a08372832215f16164e9eaebdd4face08122a9df0b141', '7111c1ea81ae4b4337f1eade8ec503da014d0f7e1f15fb69cc21bb4b8a0cd522', '56aa96557eb8ff7b96cc440b9feb37df97778f6847fbf65bd7193461e3bb1254', 'a2a60a70b6c0698c4e4bf70e2898b317be102780f7c2a75d686b6af0be8227c2', 'b1ae7306377f0f1e826bd3048a248cf8acfdcca87479b43bac1b78bb75a1a73e', '577ea117dcb2d5534f6659a3396a2103b3e6dd423ca1fb8828f26de4090d010a', '2a70d9502b704305e4ea61305be9258b6ffbdaae28fe656023f35997bb5a4123', '3de30b961cfb5f6fe4779e80aaeb9ff56c4205a05d71b4893ed30f1f580203dd', '8140c44fd226860250953251c397abd1d920ca0510d4f595e5c11425a3bcdbe3', 'b16d0056b7e20b12da25678dd82cbac576653e4ab3e974de20f54bcf8e6e9d2f']"
200,735,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=735,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2011-08-08,Scott Aaronson,Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity,"Update (August 11, 2011): Thanks to everyone who offered useful feedback! I uploaded a slightly-revised version, adding a “note of humility” to the introduction, correcting the footnote about Cramer’s Conjecture, incorporating Gil Kalai’s point that an efficient program to pass the Turing Test could exist but be computationally intractable to find, adding some more references, and starting the statement of Valiant’s sample-size theorem with the word “Consider…” instead of “Fix…”
I just posted a 53-page essay of that name to ECCC; it’s what I was writing pretty much nonstop for the last two months. The essay will appear in a volume entitled “Computability: Gödel, Turing, Church, and beyond,” which MIT Press will be publishing next year (to coincide with Alan T.’s hundredth birthday).
Note that, to explain why philosophers should care about computational complexity, I also had to touch on the related questions of why anyone should care about computational complexity, and why computational complexity theorists should care about philosophy. Anyway, here’s the abstract:
One might think that, once we know something is computable, how efficiently it can be computed is a practical question with little further philosophical importance. In this essay, I offer a detailed case that one would be wrong. In particular, I argue that computational complexity theory—the field that studies the resources (such as time, space, and randomness) needed to solve computational problems—leads to new perspectives on the nature of mathematical knowledge, the strong AI debate, computationalism, the problem of logical omniscience, Hume’s problem of induction and Goodman’s grue riddle, the foundations of quantum mechanics, economic rationality, closed timelike curves, and several other topics of philosophical interest. I end by discussing aspects of complexity theory itself that could benefit from philosophical analysis.
Weighing in with 70 footnotes and 126 references, the essay is basically a huge, sprawling mess; I hope that at least some of you will enjoy getting lost in it. I’d like to thank my editor, Oron Shagrir, for kicking me for more than a year until I finally wrote this thing.",2196,"['1387487383f4953a6124ae940a265513b08212d703cea8befbff4904a3b4677b',

(Also check out the interviews with Steven Rudich, Steven Rudich a second time, Lance Fortnow, Doron Zeilberger, and your other favorite stars of the nerdosphere!) In the interview, I talk about my passion for baseball stats, what you don’t know about llama-breeding, the use of color in Matisse’s later works … oh all right, it’s mostly about quantum computing and P vs. NP.
Here’s a story I told for an event called Story Collider, which was back-to-back with a superb production of Breaking the Code (Hugh Whitemore’s acclaimed play about the life of Alan Turing) in Cambridge’s Central Square Theater. I was honored to serve as a “scientific consultant” to the Breaking the Code production, and to do audience Q&A before and after a couple performances. In the Story Collider, I talk about the “Turing phase” I went through as a teenager and Alan T.’s impact on my life.
(Note: For the past couple years, I’ve avoided talking much about my personal life on this blog, since I pride myself on being someone who learns from experience and adjusts his behavior accordingly. But two months ago, something truly happy occurred in my life, and if you listen to the end of the Story Collider, you’ll find out what it was…)

This talk was part of a fantastic workshop called Conceptual Foundations and Foils for Quantum Information Processing, which was about ways of changing the laws of quantum mechanics to get alternative theories that still make some sort of sense, and that might shed new light on the “tried-and-true original.” In this particular talk, the speaker discusses a large number of ways to make the complexity class BQP (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time) “slightly” bigger or smaller. I’m embarrassed to admit that I watched this particular talk transfixed to the computer screen: I genuinely couldn’t predict how BQP was going to get mutilated next, and I looked forward to finding out.",920,"['69362cf4aceee10b4d9fb616a8353e3f9f995ab729704a7f557dc3c4b8055016', 'c9638dc7d9420e03f696717424b8af06cd191f013b70fa2f680948bae43c7714', 'd94c18658c62a3a42997f017199d5718f46d8142fae6816f4b65fbc808ff9b38', '99390aa3e6aad73e846f2f45bc4663f5b7fa6d0dc2d2bf30eba8154effe331af', '7e06ac610ddf11a09a49418a6d16f137c9afaf95962b0502fb109c2639bca178', '4b9ba06756bc6f3bea0dc127a452d7202d9dafcd505941313a4a4b21a488e419', 'a2cc39d985078f57eee39d8cb773ae8d393069601101c1e943f73e2e82b53f30', 'e5a565f22c804792ec1b932a8f538b4bade6b2a718b6c959e282d64a2838ba2a', 'c1b546474de927e17ccea27281f82d5a260b0f8cd82f12e1fb2696bbf13f7523', 'bb6d68c2132c96ddfbd4a225293b516126ffe26b6104bde4f6908cc51b941a36', '0f6fed719f58e3d9bd98c7516d9e19634dc275ab1bdb153ade2dd56471df513e', '62f9c00d1f77244db49e779acfce8e3a6420d61600658c7ffb7ca0779f029404', '50a761ca662d516eef4750b573a414f12042f8958d27e3d27b1319a52422b75c', 'cbe9bf4ff0a5f4d41abedb5780604890ad64639a15c549147f8e20f0aa25db34', '15d9a5563b3b18f148ecebcd0c334525fbffaa57045a0b4a212f130629a6ded5', 'ab8c995738200e0ce3b605923c278be533c6eee684a6a85692769471e28b5f50', 'baa3c1246f83efdb73d0a944979b46d6d2bad20d2037cb36459910aa6e6f0840', '70fdb082dba50b8ea3c045a94f344b8626bbbfb6e2bd18b568b6ba8d510aec47', '7314bb255e51d0aaedbf7f083e49d2514451b6d2d75325874ca29e26b45c4ffd']"
204,639,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=639,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2011-05-15,Scott Aaronson,Quantum-Effect-Demonstrating Beef,"Update (May 25): See my Q&A about D-Wave’s new announcement at Forbes.com.
Update (May 26): See also this very helpful Quora post by Dave Bacon, who says mostly the same things I did (though it always sounds better when he says it!)
Clearly, there hasn’t been enough controversy on Shtetl-Optimized this past week. But I have just the thing to fix that: a new D-Wave post!
For three days, people have been sending me the news by land, sea, and air that D-Wave just published a paper in Nature, describing evidence for quantum annealing behavior in a system of eight superconducting flux qubits. The paper itself is behind a paywall, but the more detailed Electronic Supplementary Material is available for free (see also D-Wave’s blog post). As usual, my readers apparently expect me to render an instantaneous opinion.
But for the first time in the history of major D-Wave announcements, I’m unable to do so. For D-Wave is finally doing the very thing that I and others have been begging them to do for years: that is, directly addressing the question of whether their systems actually exploit quantum effects, or just perform classical simulated annealing. In the new work, they apply an annealing operation to eight coupled qubits arranged in a 1D chain, then plot the probability of a particular basis state as a function of time, by running the experiment over and over and stopping it at various intermediate points. They then look at the dependence of the probability-versus-time curve on a third parameter, the temperature, and claim that they can explain the curve’s temperature dependence by a numerical simulation that assumes quantum mechanics, but not by one that assumes classical simulated annealing.
To be clear, an eight-qubit spin chain with a quantum-mechanical temperature dependence is still a very long way from anything commercially useful (and it’s notable that, now that D-Wave has happily joined the ruling-out-the-null-hypothesis club, we’re down from 128 qubits back to 8). This paper also makes no claims to demonstrate entanglement, which is almost certainly necessary for any interesting quantum speedup, and which has been verified in other superconducting qubit experiments (e.g., the Schoelkopf Lab‘s at Yale), but as far as I know still not in D-Wave’s. Even so, after four years of the quantum computing community being told to review a restaurant based solely on its ice water and table settings, I’m delighted that D-Wave has finally brought an appetizer. Expert readers who’ve actually tasted the appetizer are urged, in the strongest terms, to share their analysis in the comments section. I’m looking forward to our least-uninteresting D-Wave discussion ever.
But first, let me anticipate the question that at least one commenter will ask (I mean you, rrtucci). No, I don’t have any regrets about pouring cold water on D-Wave’s previous announcements, because as far as I can tell, I was right! For years, D-Wave trumpeted “quantum computing demonstrations” that didn’t demonstrate anything of the kind; tried the research community’s patience with hype and irrelevant side claims; and persistently dodged the central question of how it knew it was doing quantum computing rather than classical simulated annealing. So when people asked me about it, that’s exactly what I told them. Now, whether because it took the skeptics’ criticisms to heart, or for whatever other reasons, D-Wave has done a real experiment that deserves the careful scrutiny it will receive. I just call the shots as they’re fired.
As some of you might be aware, I’m a theoretical computer scientist, not a physicist (much less an experimentalist). So in previous posts, the only reason I even presumed to comment on experimental matters is that D-Wave made it easy for me! My “expert analysis” mostly just consisted of pointing out, over and over, that D-Wave hadn’t yet brought the QEDB (Quantum-Effect-Demonstrating Beef)—and that, until they did so, there seemed to be little reason even to discuss the other issues that D-Wave’s marketing materials and the press were both spending 95% of their time on. Now that a slice of QEDB (or something that looks like one, anyway) is on the table, I think there’s at least as much need as ever for critical evaluation of D-Wave’s claims from the quantum computing research community, but I no longer see Shtetl-Optimized filling that need. So I hereby announce my retirement as Chief D-Wave Skeptic, a job that I never wanted in the first place. New applicants for this rewarding position are urged to apply in the comments section; background in experimental physics a

205,613,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=613,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2011-05-03,Scott Aaronson,Better late than never,"No, I’m not talking about Osama, but about my reactions below to a New Yorker article about quantum computing—reactions whose writing was rudely interrupted by last night’s news. Of all the possible times in the past decade to get him, they had to pick one that would overshadow an important Shtetl-Optimized discussion about complexity theory, the Many-Worlds Interpretation, and the popularization of science? Well, I guess I’ll let it slide.
As already discussed on Peter Woit’s blog, this week’s New Yorker has a long piece about quantum computing by the novelist Rivka Galchen (unfortunately the article is behind a paywall). Most of the article is about the quantum computing pioneer David Deutsch: his genius, his eccentricity, his certainty that parallel universes exist, his insistence on rational explanations for everything, his disdain for “intellectual obfuscators” (of whom Niels Bohr is a favorite example), his indifference to most of the problems that occupy other quantum computing researchers, the messiness of his house, his reluctance to leave his house, and his love of the TV show House.
Having spent a wonderful, mind-expanding day with Deutsch in 2002—at his house in Oxford, of course—I can personally vouch for all of the above (except the part about House, which hadn’t yet debuted then). On the one hand, Deutsch is one of the most brilliant conversationalists I’ve ever encountered; on the other hand, I was astonished to find myself, as a second-year graduate student, explaining to the father of quantum computing what BQP was. So basically, David Deutsch is someone who merits a New Yorker profile if anyone does. And I was pleased to see Galchen skillfully leveraging Deutsch’s highly-profilable personality to expose a lay audience (well, OK, a chardonnay-sipping Manhattan socialite audience) to some of the great questions of science and philosophy.
However, reading this article also depressed me, as it dawned on me that the entire thing could have been written fifteen years ago, with only minor changes to the parts about experiment and zero change to the theoretical parts. I thought: “has there really been that little progress in quantum computing theory the past decade and a half—at least progress that a New Yorker reader would care about?” Even the sociological observations are dated: Galchen writes about interest in quantum computing as the “Oxford flu,” rather than the “Waterloo flu” or “Caltech flu” that it’s been since 2000 or so (the latter two capitals of the field aren’t even mentioned!). A good analogy would be an article about the Web, published today, that described the strange and exciting new world of Netscape, HotBot, and AltaVista.
A more serious issue is that the article falls victim to almost every misleading pop-science trope about quantum computing that some of us have trying to correct for the past decade. For example:
With one millionth of the hardware of an ordinary laptop, a quantum computer could store as many bits of information as there are particles in the universe.
Noooooo! That’s only for an extremely strange definition of “store”…
Oxford’s eight-qubit quantum computer has significantly less computational power than an abacus, but fifty to a hundred qubits could make something as powerful as any laptop.
Noooooo! Fifty to a hundred qubits could maybe replace your laptop, if the only thing you wanted to use your laptop for was simulating a system of fifty to a hundred qubits…
In a 1985 paper, Deutsch pointed out that, because Turing was working with classical physics, his universal computer could imitate only a subset of possible computers. Turing’s theory needed to account for quantum mechanics if its logic was to hold. Deutsch proposed a universal quantum computer based on quantum physics, which would have calculating powers that Turing’s computer (even in theory) could not simulate.
There are at least three problems here. The first is conflating simulation with efficient simulation. At the risk of going hoarse, a classical Turing machine can calculate absolutely everything that a quantum computer can calculate! It might “merely” need exponentially more time. Second, no one has proved that a classical Turing machine really does need exponentially more time, i.e., that it can’t efficiently simulate a quantum computer. That remains a (deep, plausible, and widely-believed) conjecture, which will take enormous mathematical advances to resolve. And third, Deutsch’s landmark paper wasn’t among the ones to give evidence for that conjecture. The first such evidence only came later, with the work of Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon, and Shor.
To be fair to Galchen, Deutsch himself has often been inaccurate on these points, even though he ought to (and does!) know better. Specifically, he conflates the original Church-Turing Thesis (which isn’t challenged in the slightest by quantum computing) with its modern, polynomial-time version (which is), and he neglects to mention the conjectural status of quantum computers’ speedup. Here are two examples out of many, from The Fabric of Reality:
“quantum computers can perform computations of which no (human) mathematician will ever, even in principle, be capable.”
“if the visible universe were the extent of physical reality, physical reality would not even remotely contain the resources required to factorize such a large number.”
Am I just harping over technicalities here? In my view, the issue goes deeper. All of the above oversights can be understood as symptoms of complexophobia: the fear of acknowledging that one is actually making statements about computational complexity theory. Again and again, I’ve seen science writers go through strange verbal contortions to avoid the question of how anyone could know that a computation inherently requires a huge amount of time—as if the reader must be prevented, at all costs, from seeing such a claim as anything other than obvious. It can be fascinating to watch, in the same way it’s fascinating to watch a politician discuss (say) Confederate History Month without mentioning slavery. How long can you poke and prod the P versus NP beast without rousting it?
On the other hand, complexity theory does show up in Galchen’s article, and in an extremely interesting context: that of explaining where Deutsch got the idea for quantum computing.
According to Deutsch, the insight for [his famous 1985 paper] came from a conversation in the early eighties with the physicist Charles Bennett, of I.B.M., about computational-complexity theory, at the time a sexy new field that investigated the difficulty of a computational task.
Is “at the time” meant to imply complexity theory is no longer sexy, or merely that it’s no longer new? Leaving that aside…
Mass, for instance, is a fundamental property, because it remains the same in any setting; weight is a relative property, because an object’s weight depends on the strength of gravity acting on it … If computational complexity was like mass—if it was a relative property—then complexity was quite profound; if not, then not.
“I was just sounding off,” Deutsch said. “I said they make too much of this”—meaning complexity theory—“because there’s no standard computer with respect to which you should be calculating the complexity of the task.” Just as an object’s weight depends on the force of gravity in which it’s measured, the degree of computational complexity depended on the computer on which it was measured. One could find out how complex a task was to perform on a particular computer, but that didn’t say how complex a task was fundamentally, in reference to the universe … Complexity theorists, Deutsch reasoned, were wasting their time.
The tale continues with Bennett pointing out that the universe itself could be taken to be the “fundamental computer,” which leads Deutsch to the shocking realization that the complexity theorists weren’t complete morons. Sure, they had a silly theory where all the answers depended on which computer you chose (which somehow none of them ever noticed), but luckily, it could be fixed by the simple addition of quantum mechanics!
Over the anguished howls of my classical complexity-theorist friends, I should point out that this story isn’t completely false. There’s no denying that merging quantum mechanics with theoretical computer science was a major advance in human knowledge, and that the people who first had the idea to merge the two were not computer scientists, but physicists like Deutsch and Feynman (the latter’s role is completely left out of Galchen’s story).
But complexity theory wasn’t so much a flawed early attempt at quantum computing as an essential prerequisite to it: the thing that made it possible to articulate how quantum computers might differ from classical computers in the first place. Indeed, it occurs to me that Deutsch and Bennett’s conversation provides the key to resolving a puzzle discussed in the article:
“Quantum computers should have been invented in the nineteen-thirties,” [Deutsch] observed near the end of our conversation. “The stuff that I did in the late nineteen-seventies and early nineteen-eighties didn’t use any innovation that hadn’t been known in the thirties.” That is straightforwardly true. Deutsch went on, “The question is why.”
I used to go around saying the same thing: “someone like John von Neumann could have easily invented quantum computing in the 1930s, had he just put the pieces together!” But I now suspect this view is a mistake, the result of projecting what’s obvious today onto a much earlier era. For there’s at least one essential ingredient for quantum computing that wouldn’t enter scientific consciousness until the 1970s or so: complexity theory, and particularly the distinction between polynomial and exponential time.
Over the years, I’ve developed what I call the Minus-Sign Test, a reliable way to rate popularizations of quantum mechanics. To pass the Minus-Sign Test, all a popularization needs to do is mention the minus signs: i.e., interference between positive and negative amplitudes, the defining feature of quantum mechanics, the thing that makes it different from classical probability theory, the reason why we can’t say Schrödinger’s cat is “really either dead or alive,” and we simply don’t know which one, the reason why the entangled particles can’t have just agreed in advance that one would spin up and the other would spin down. Another name for the Minus-Sign Test is the High-School Student Test, since it’s the thing that determines whether a bright high-school student, meeting quantum mechanics for the first time through the popularization, would come away thinking of superposition as
(a) one of the coolest discoveries about Nature ever made, or
(b) a synonym used by some famous authority figures for ignorance.
Despite the low bar set by the Minus-Sign Test, I’m afraid almost every popular article about quantum mechanics ever written has failed it, the present piece included.
Reading Not Even Wrong, I was surprised at first that the discussion centered around Deutsch’s argument that quantum computing proves the existence of Many Worlds. (More precisely, Deutsch’s position is that Many Worlds is an established fact with or without quantum computing, but that for those who are too dense or stubborn to see it, a working quantum computer will be useful for hitting them over the head.)
As others pointed out: yes, the state of the universe as described by quantum mechanics is a vastly, exponentially bigger thing than anything dreamt of in classical physics; and a scalable quantum computer would be dramatic evidence that this exponentiality is really “out there,” that it’s not just an artifact of our best current theory. These are not merely truths, but truths worth shouting from the rooftops.
However, there’s then the further question of whether it’s useful to talk about one quantum-mechanical universe as an exponential number of parallel semi-classical universes. After all, to whatever extent the branches of a superposition successfully contribute to a quantum computation, to that extent they’re not so much “parallel universes” as one giant, fault-tolerantly-encoded, self-interfering blob; and to whatever extent those branches do look like parallel universes, to that extent they’re now forever out of causal contact with each other—the branches other than our own figuring into our explanations for observable events only in the way that classical counterfactuals figure in.
Anyway, I thought: does anyone still care about these issues? Wasn’t every possible argument and counterargument explored to death years ago?
But this reaction just reveals my personal bias. Sometime in graduate school, I realized that I was less interested in winning philosophical debates than in discovering new phenomena for philosophers to debate about. Why brood over the true meaning of (say) Gödel’s Theorem or the Bell Inequality, when there are probably other such worldview-changing results still to be found, and those results might render the brooding irrelevant anyway? Because of this attitude, I confess to being less interested in whether Many-Worlds is true than in whether it’s scientifically fruitful. As Peter Shor once memorably put it on this blog: why not be a Many-Worlder on Monday, a Bohmian on Tuesday, and a Copenhagenist on Wednesday, if that’s what helps you prove new theorems?
Ironically, this attitude seems to me to mesh well with Deutsch’s own emphasis on explanation as the goal of science. Ask not whether the parallel universes are “really there,” or whether they should really be called “parallel universes”—ask what explanatory work they do for you! (That is, over and above the explanatory work that QM itself already does for you, assuming you accept it and know how to use it.)
So for me, the single strongest argument in favor of Many-Worlds is what I call the “Deutsch argument”:
Many-Worlds is scientifically fruitful, because it led David Deutsch to think of quantum computing.
This argument carries considerable force for me. On the other hand, if we accept it, then it seems we should also accept the following argument:
Bohmian mechanics is scientifically fruitful, because it led John Bell to think of the Bell inequality.
Furthermore, consider the following facts:
David Deutsch is a brilliant, iconoclastic theoretical physicist, who thought deeply about quantum foundations at a time when it was unfashionable to do so. His extraordinary (and not wholly-unjustified!) self-confidence in his own powers of reasoning has led to his defending not one but many heterodox ideas.
Is it possible that these facts provide a common explanation for Deutsch’s certainty about Many-Worlds and his pioneering role in quantum computing, without our needing to invoke the former to explain the latter?
Let me end with a few miscellaneous reactions to Galchen’s article.
Physics advances by accepting absurdities. Its history is one of unbelievable ideas proving to be true.
I’d prefer to say the history of physics is one of a vast number of unbelievable ideas proving to be false, and a few specific unbelievable ideas proving to be true—especially ideas having to do with the use of negative numbers where one might have thought only positive numbers made sense.
[Robert Schoelkopf and his group at Yale] have configured their computer to run what is known as a Grover’s algorithm, one that deals with a four-card-monte type of question: Which hidden card is the queen? It’s a sort of Shor’s algorithm for beginners, something that a small quantum computer can take on.
No, small quantum computers can and have taken on both Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms, solving tiny instances in each case. The real difference between Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms is one that complexophobia might prevent Galchen from mentioning: Shor gives you a (conjectured) exponential speedup for some highly-specific problems (factoring and discrete log), while Grover gives you “merely” a quadratic speedup, but for a much wider class of problems.
“Look,” [Deutsch] went on, “I can’t stop you from writing an article about a weird English guy who thinks there are parallel universes. But I think that style of thinking is kind of a put-down to the reader. It’s almost like saying, If you’re not weird in these ways, you’ve got no hope as a creative thinker. That’s not true. The weirdness is only superficial.”
This was my favorite passage in the article.",16506,"['3ae0efc103a73b71ee033db5d5f9ce01978494ad517a5d373257c8112c0f5283', '5af323868276ffe881a54edd35ffe1cb27641a2214886fea1bdffded87b98213',

206,570,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=570,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2011-03-09,Scott Aaronson,Valiant’s valiance recognized,"Update (March 25): I have a new paper called A Linear-Optical Proof that the Permanent is #P-Hard, which is dedicated to Les Valiant on the occasion of his Turing Award. Here’s the abstract:
One of the crown jewels of complexity theory is Valiant’s 1979 theorem that computing the permanent of an n*n matrix is #P-hard. Here we show that, by using the model of linear-optical quantum computing—and in particular, a universality theorem due to Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn—one can give a different and arguably more intuitive proof of this theorem.
For decades, Harvard’s Leslie Valiant has obviously deserved a Turing Award—and today, the ACM most excellently announced its agreement with the obvious. I have little to add to the prize citation (see also Lance’s post): from launching new fields whose reach extends beyond theory (PAC-learning), to proving epochal results (#P-completeness of the permanent), to asking hugely influential questions (permanent vs. determinant), Valiant has been a creative powerhouse of theoretical computer science for longer than I’ve been alive.
One thing the prize citation doesn’t mention is that Valiant is now the third Turing Award winner (after Andy Yao and Len Adleman) to have made a major contribution to quantum computing theory. Valiant’s 2001 paper Quantum Computers that can be Simulated Classically in Polynomial Time introduced the beautiful computational model that computer scientists now know as “matchgates,” and that physicists know as “noninteracting fermions.” It still amazes that Valiant proposed this model for purely mathematical reasons—hitting physical relevance straight between the eyes despite (as far as I can tell) not having that target anywhere in his sights.
To put the point in terms that my physicist friends will understand, that Valiant himself would probably dispute, but that I would defend:
Valiant’s work has shown that, even if our universe hadn’t been made of bosons and fermions, theoretical computer scientists would have had compelling reasons of their own to invent those particles or something equivalent to them—and furthermore, that at least one theoretical computer scientist would have had the imagination to do so.
Certainly Valiant has had a huge influence on me, both through his work and as someone who made time to talk to me as an obscure grad student a decade ago. Three of my papers—The Learnability of Quantum States, A Full Characterization of Quantum Advice, and The Computational Complexity of Linear Optics—would collapse entirely without Valiant-laid foundations.
Congratulations, Les!",2589,"['97450fbcb5f4a68b3df9b78e5dcf25b9fdbddad7c257f3637499e09ace46f902', '5afbbb8f5cc3b2421bbbc467c67e33a0500cdaf76474c77a161c88b18b673b22', '1959fc27fad015d44346b1bc131c42ea726703b4617857b4ba3e77bc5eb3a878', '992452fe9e6e9c5c02fd4045d041624d74a43551e33e44fabc115aa60e6583ee', '8e836976ef35719e04ae8597f06dc0bce30efd1c4e2ce6aeba4d0cf7a4e55ea1', 'be374e1818bc97504eba56d74a86a6aebef8542a8c3b15e64929c0b4a15a5f36', '61cb52b739ac3768943e2ee4b8c5e93919b99723b0c180b723ebce742fb2964f', '5c8c18c430d2250a48d7d84f835d01107240e726b3463dacf9cd0de071f73272', '6ab3a9fbaaa14f11a7bb2d27001d237fa1b0a73d1d33ad791ed522bea91232b3', '3b39ce147361681e609ae75d5c3154ceae1a1b5649381846b21b7993eb950199', 'dd788c38b6b574302f4179807243e5cb4404ccae7e9c9b189cdaac31d9c95eed', '0e4a1f7571f38cd2071ec22fdb0f6c80f4d483e220971af15e42884c9c167c58', '6b92813dd13e65ac64260149817e90cd31302f86de931fc53691bac3192a1fc1', '5df6cf258c798356d82dc535982b658f86eaee9398ed3dc33bd71abc30b0f1ea', 'd9cd8311df368b36717e7d24f920fe58c3b58353dc9afd733a0c3f7bffdcd0bf', '2312341b602550a62193c1b2052fe7b796b038a31e030fc3a1873c6e94c30cef', '1acc5f799cf1ebc3b0f92941e990aa97ad92ec82664b410ce4433000df07b8eb', '9c4c1a20d084e27b86d0390f528f21eccfb183c4d9a2895da3bff403cfb548bb', 'b88f2183080e74e96108c239fcb3e8474a3e94b790e9b20d938730fc09785f30', 'c172dcfc6807a587b01b2de8bfbdbf5eaf8810605151b2b07975f74961e46d00', '6ed97c088e033dc49e4cbc96d0e88420ff144042c83af5ce42a48c5365be135e', '2daba16cdf5b28d96f1db987e39b0af5175cac41d391e9752314411f07b42354', '0e780921fd30c54e72eec4b86227109555e8275ede428bf7d3437f8dacf47fdb', 'b403b97b92802330f99ddd09f71a1fea3a42ff696a93af85b573be051713bd55']"

Although the title—“The quantum singularity”—made me wince a little, I was impressed by the effort Larry put into getting the facts right, and especially laying out the problems that still need to be solved.
Less successful was a story in PC Magazine based on MIT’s press release, which contained the following sentence (let me know if you can decipher what the author meant—I couldn’t):
Aaronson says that he and Arkhipov have not successfully proven that designing a device capable of testing the theory is impossible—which is an important first step, whether to eventually building a quantum computer, or even just laying the initial framework for using the microscopic secrets of the universe to let humans better understand the world that surrounds them.
However, in the competition for Popular Science Article Sentence of the Year, the sentence above will have to contend with a now-classic sentence from the New York Times article about Watson:
More than anything, the contest was a vindication for the academic field of computer science, which began with great promise in the 1960s with the vision of creating a thinking machine and which became the laughingstock of Silicon Valley in the 1980s, when a series of heavily financed start-up companies went bankrupt.
To the NYT’s credit, they quickly posted a correction:

Thanks so much to the students for making the course a success—I hope they enjoyed it at least half as much as I did!
A central part of 6.845 is the course project, which can be either a literature survey or original research in quantum complexity, and which can be done either individually or in pairs. The majority of the students chose to do original research—which surprised me, given how little time was available and how inherently unpredictable theorizing is. Yet all the projects ended up being good, and some ended up being spectacular—initiating new topics, making progress on open problems that I’d worked on without success, etc. So with the students’ kind permission, I decided to pick six outstanding projects for a “blog showcase.” (Obviously, inclusion in this showcase doesn’t preclude the projects being published “for real,” as I hope and expect they will be!)
Without further ado:
Alessandro Chiesa and Michael Forbes, A Note on QMA With Multiple Provers. Here Ale and Michael improve previous QMA(k) protocols for NP-complete problems due to Aaronson-Beigi-Drucker-Fefferman-Shor and Beigi—boosting the success probability by polynomial factors and showing how to verify a much wider range of problems than just 3SAT and 3-Coloring.
Paul Christiano, Toward Quantum Money Relative to a Classical Oracle. In a Complexity’09 paper (whose full version, alas, isn’t yet finished), I showed that there exists a “quantum oracle” relative to which quantum money, which anyone can verify but no one can efficiently counterfeit, is possible. Here Paul takes the next step, giving a candidate quantum money scheme that only requires a classical oracle. Unfortunately, there’s still a gap in the security proof for this scheme, but I’m optimistic that with new ideas the gap can be filled.
Alan Deckelbaum, Quantum Correlated Equilibria in Classical Complete Information Games. In this innovative paper, Alan defines a new concept of quantum correlated equilibria in quantum game theory (see here for the definition of classical correlated equilibria, due to Aumann), and studies its basic properties. In particular, he proves the nontrivial result that there exist equilibria that can be realized using classical correlation, but that can’t be realized using pure-state entanglement without one or more players having incentive to deviate. See here for some independent related work by Shengyu Zhang.
Shelby Kimmel, Quantum Adversary (Upper) Bound. (Also on the arXiv; two closely-related arXiv preprints are Speed from Repetition by Shelby, and Super-Polynomial Quantum Speed-ups for Boolean Evaluation Trees with Hidden Structure by Shelby along with Bohua Zhan and Avinatan Hassidim.) This work has to be read and understood to be believed—I too was skeptical at first! Basically, Shelby gives an example of a promise problem with a constant-query quantum algorithm—except she has no idea what the algorithm is! She can only prove its existence nonconstructively, by first giving a quantum algorithm for a composed version of the problem, and then appealing to Ben Reichardt’s breakthrough characterization of quantum query complexity in terms of span programs. For a special case of the problem, she’s able to give an explicit O(1)-query quantum algorithm by using the Haar wavelet transform.
Andy Lutomirski, On the Query Complexity of Counterfeiting Quantum Money. Independently of Paul Christiano, here Andy proposes a different quantum money scheme using a classical oracle, which again ought to work but is missing only a security proof. Along the way, Andy also proposes a beautiful new query complexity problem—the “Separate Components Problem”—which cries out for a quantum lower bound, and might also lead to a classical oracle separation between QMA and QCMA.
Raluca Ada Popa, Witness-Indistinguishability Against Quantum Adversaries. Building on John Watrous’s work on quantum zero-knowledge, here Raluca defines the new notion of quantum witness-indistinguishability, and proves many of its basic properties. For example, she shows that if quantum computationally-concealing commitment schemes exist, then all of NP has witness-indistinguishable proofs that are computationally secure against quantum adversaries. As with so much else in cryptography, even just getting the definitions right is a nontrivial affair!",4492,"['7240789e20dc8dde4472f627753423891f7e94508acd64e4a690319a1fa5a3c8', '906bb39ad03b88e90c77490fea01919e12506151c4dcaa7707f2a9173f0015b8', 'ab7993f9820e30819141738fb26e5a8e5c9865212ff6d5ecf809ac8220bd5121', 'd164e9de1bec5c12fcb05326bdac7768c5e515b84226ac99ddd1d64739ea453a', '795727d142d6ed16262b8dd277aef6b529b0d5da0a972e95ca586970d9272730', 'cec3651881c494da8763951e08c5ca939c92f7222dfe519fe71b81533602cea0', '0ef8b171b69d59b8b2bb70f48f00fc76caca6a86bff3798030a02312e720fd28', 'fa40a5204bd19354393a18bd52c68d3f2e984f7ad78e1c4ee545aa82aad9391f', '9b64d6032dc4d7476ee87178b7ce9ee9885e70cb46c5de831e7c9e3f7a9d25b0', '3487667dcdf8cc383b52f4eb19bd3221dfd173d5025bc045e1f3f6b53947e26d', 'e0e8ce371e6308a5650c9318eb1816bb57e85a7bc9a7b89dea97a460b9e4924e', 'f812e00129bd53d965b59f488ab55d8db270b5c2eda1e149d32ec28508846cf0', '4c36c4695f28a63bfa106d570b7ad8a94a6c7a01618384153e9d2f5ecf32cf41', 'dd75238e4b53f202713e075564bdc3f01254fa90544d50cb3730ac27b5b51852', '00c5ce05d41913836e24202fbcc2c2b673f49501dc5ecc2bfa75f2572145e49b', 'f4e58e5c288f786ed847c0a5361742549fa795ee577a5bd9f11e32adb45fbcab', '81da5ca8ee6da3d085f36feb48ad31b64a2ad1fad39ff9cd28dda744134d0e39', 'ca49b3a168348fa8feb397d990d024ee409f4d5a933238774ee2f956cab8fc0d', '033d5cd1dd454b5d9c264dbb8207830f7b17e4433e6c1eeafde39dca5aeab23e', '923d52a2b8cfb54141945f3541f2283956c1bf1721115c4ecadd8b326e61700b', 'e805fc692350c0f95418bdebe85ffc26e08b1ebc306f2741ddf4640ada4df58e', 'e526afc1994240d15c5912005b5b5905ce3534e0d21141e61f768c4a6945a59a', '1056d92b75c4f65dbe343010eae6eb42ac1e37cb1b69b4f0118e3ceeb8043703', 'eac37373f9d1b20bbd6fe244f1dafcb9014eaae38b5a4071e3ad28e93bc22f9e', '32738812e0f4ff9a5acaf362228b5a5f6819ad9dadf10c087d49ae4cefb015df', 'f9a6b9802da3afca1ddc11fe7a589759de843a0176e72b723bae719db755b871', 'b50ff8f5b91c2e809f5cd78bf537d67f3f8ebc1826138d6473ebb62085c1b53b', 'd8abaacea133e5bdca951c0e750c0b6f0d0d29fc58664881add8a0c796fbd0a9', '10a4fecaa732a4db79bfa5e42769eaffb545aced3bebcaf9aa3a7313f5db0565', 'd5f804b223d29b9c829752e6e807e527c846ceb7d1eff94e80e1fa76dbe824a8']"

First, sadly, I’ll be going to neither ICS’2011 in Beijing nor QIP’2011 in Singapore this coming week—too much travel! If you’re going to either conference and would like to contribute a guest post, please let me know.
Second, I posted a note to the arXiv this week called Impossibility of Succinct Quantum Proofs for Collision-Freeness. Here’s the abstract:
We show that any quantum algorithm to decide whether a function f:[n]→[n] is a permutation or far from a permutation must make Ω(n1/3/w) queries to f, even if the algorithm is given a w-qubit quantum witness in support of f being a permutation. This implies that there exists an oracle A such that SZKA⊄QMAA, answering an eight-year-old open question of the author. Indeed, we show that relative to some oracle, SZK is not in the counting class A0PP defined by Vyalyi. The proof is a fairly simple extension of the quantum lower bound for the collision problem.
This result is neither hard nor surprising, but it does more-or-less solve a problem that’s bothered me since grad school (and which I mentioned a couple months ago on this blog) in a ridiculously simple-in-retrospect way, which is either nice or disappointing depending on how you look at it.
Third, some of you might have heard that the Carmel region in Israel recently suffered a terrible forest fire, which destroyed about 30 million trees and killed 44 people, and which required the assistance of many countries to put out.

210,473,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=473,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2010-11-13,Scott Aaronson,The Computational Complexity of Linear Optics,"I usually avoid blogging about my own papers—since, as a tenure-track faculty member, I prefer to be known as a media-whoring clown who trashes D-Wave Sudoku claims, bets $200,000 against alleged P≠NP proofs, and complains about his lecture notes being appropriated by Australian actresses to sell printers. Any research that I happen to do is best kept secret, lest it interfere with that carefully-constructed persona.
Today, though, I’m making an exception. On Thursday, my PhD student Alex Arkhipov and I finally finished our mammoth
94 95-page preprint on The Computational Complexity of Linear Optics, which we were writing for the past year. (Remarkably, this is Alex’s first paper. Congratulations, Alex!) Never before was I involved in a project that forced me to learn so many unfamiliar things, from experimental quantum optics to random matrix theory to exotic complexity classes like BPPNP and PostBQP. (Alright, that last one wasn’t particularly unfamiliar, but the others were.)
In one sentence, the goal of our paper is to help bridge the yawning gap between what complexity theorists believe is true about quantum mechanics—namely, that it’s exponentially-hard to simulate on a classical computer—and what experimentalists can currently demonstrate. To do so, we try to “meet the experimentalists halfway,” by proposing a linear-optical setup that seems significantly closer to practicality than (say) a universal quantum computer, but still solves a computational problem that we can show is intractable for classical computers, under plausible and clearly-stated hardness assumptions (which don’t just amount to “our system is hard to simulate”!).
Without further ado, here’s the abstract:
We give new evidence that quantum computers — moreover, rudimentary quantum computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements — cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular, we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically intractable under plausible assumptions.
Our first result says that, if there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P#P=BPPNP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation.
Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture, which says that it is #P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture, which says that |Per(A)|≥√(n!)/poly(n) with high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem interesting even apart from our application.
This paper does not assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to develop the beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying our model, and its connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained way accessible to theoretical computer scientists.
As you can see from the abstract, there’s a huge amount still to be done—of which the most obvious is (1) proving our #P-hardness conjecture and (2) doing our experiment! I’m also hopeful that people will take up the challenge of proving similar hardness results for other “rudimentary” quantum systems, besides linear optics. In that vein, one immediate question is whether we can give evidence that the beautiful “commuting quantum computations” model of Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd is hard to simulate even approximately by a classical computer.
Here are a few options for anyone who’s slightly curious about our work, but not curious enough to, y’know, download the paper:
- My PowerPoint slides.
- Alex’s PowerPoint slides, which I like better than mine.
- A MathOverflow question that I posted yesterday about the Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture, and which was quickly answered by Terry Tao.
- A CS Theory StackExchange question about our paper posted by András Salamon, which I answered this morning.
- New: An interesting blog post about our work by Gil Kalai.
Anyway, the main purpose of this post was simply to provide a place for people with questions about our paper to ask them.

211,471,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=471,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2010-10-27,Scott Aaronson,Research projects in quantum complexity theory,"Today I’m in College Park, Maryland, for a fun quantum information workshop. I just came from Las Vegas, where I was at FOCS 2010, appropriately held at the Monte Carlo. (Don’t tell anyone, but I also skipped out on part of the conference for a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon.)
However, while I’ll be happy to answer questions about either of those conferences (or about the Grand Canyon, I guess), the rest of this post won’t be about them. Instead, it will be about some relatively approachable-looking open problems in quantum complexity theory: basically, the problems that I’d be tackling today if I were a bright-eyed grad student instead of a senile, over-the-hill 29-year-old.
The inspiration for this open problems list came from the graduate course I’m currently teaching on Quantum Complexity Theory. Just like when I taught this class two years ago, I’m asking every student to complete a term project, either individually or in groups of two. Here’s the thing: assigning student projects in theoretical computer science turns out to be damn hard. Even if you make it clear that a literature survey is fine, many of the students admirably want to do something original. But how do you come up with a theory problem that
(a) hasn’t been solved, and
(b) can be solved by someone who’s just learning the material, with a high probability of success, in 1-2 months?
And thus it is that I present my sort-of updated version of my Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory. Despite the original motivation, most of these problems are probably too hard for a student term project—but all of them, I think, have term-project-sized chunks that could be ripped off. The new challenges list makes no claim whatsoever of comprehensiveness, and is heavily skewed toward problems that I, personally, have worked on.
Without further ado, and organized into seven topics, starting with the one closest to my heart:
Quantum Query Complexity
Can we use Reichardt’s breakthrough characterization of quantum query complexity by span programs and the negative-weight adversary method to obtain new results on quantum query complexity for concrete problems?
In the quantum black-box model, if we relax the assumption that the linear transformations are unitary, and merely require that, for every Boolean input x, the sum of the squares of the “amplitudes” of the accept states is a probability (i.e., belongs to [0,1]), do we ever get an asymptotically smaller query complexity? What about an exponentially smaller query complexity?
Given a quantum algorithm that makes T queries, can we approximate its acceptance probability on most Boolean inputs using a classical algorithm that makes poly(T) queries? (See here for more.)
Are randomized and quantum query complexities polynomially related for all functions f(x1,…,xn) that are invariant under permuting the indices 1,…,n (for example, the Collision and Element Distinctness functions)? (In previous work with Ambainis, we showed randomized and quantum query complexities are polynomially related for all functions that are invariant under permuting both the indices and the values of x1,…,xn.)
Can every quantum algorithm that makes k queries to an n-bit string, be simulated by a randomized algorithm that makes n1-1/2k queries? Does the k-fold generalization of the Fourier Checking problem provide an example for which this conjectured bound is tight?
Let f be a black-box function, which is promised to be either 1-to-1 or 2-to-1. Is there a polylog(n)-qubit quantum proof that f is 1-to-1, which can be verified using polylog(n) quantum queries to f? (If not, then we get an oracle relative to which SZK is not in QMA.)
Let f be a black-box function, which is promised either to satisfy the Simon promise or to be one-to-one. Can a prover with the power of BQP convince a BPP verifier that f is one-to-one?
Cryptography
Are there interesting functionalities, besides point functions, that can be quantumly copy-protected?
Can we give classical oracles relative to which publicly-verifiable quantum money and copy-protected quantum software are possible?
Is the GGM construction of pseudorandom functions from pseudorandom generators secure even against quantum adversaries? If not, can we give an analogous construction that’s secure?
Intermediate Possibilities Between BPP And BQP
Is it true that every set of unitary quantum gates (acting on qubits) is either universal for quantum computation, or else simulable in classical polynomial time?
If a quantum computer is in a tree state at every time step, does it follow that the computer can be simulated in classical polynomial time (i.e., in BPP)?
If a quantum computer is in a separable mixed state at every time step, does it follow that the computer can be simulated in classical polynomial time?
Postselection
Can we take any quantum computational model that allows adaptive measurements, and simulate it by a model that allows postselected measurements instead?
What are the “weakest” models of quantum computation that yield all of PostBQP when combined with postselection on measurement outcomes?
Communication Complexity
In the Group Membership Problem, there is a finite group G known to both Alice and Bob. Alice is given a subgroup H of G, Bob is given an element x of G, and the problem is for Bob to decide whether x is in H. What is the randomized one-way communication complexity of GM? Can we prove a lower-bound better than the trivial log|G|, thereby separating randomized and quantum one-way communication complexities for a total Boolean function?
Are the randomized and quantum one-way communication complexities polynomially related for every total Boolean function f? What about the randomized and quantum two-way communication complexities?
QMA(2)
Is QMA(2) contained in EXP? To put it differently: let V be a two-outcome measurement, which acts on the tensor product of two n-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Is there a quasipolynomial-time classical algorithm that approximates max|ψ>[V accepts |ψ>2] to constant additive error?
Is QMA(2) with real amplitudes the same thing as QMA(2) with complex amplitudes?
Quantum Computing With Locality Constraints
Let G be a graph with n vertices, and let U be an nxn unitary matrix with the property that uij≠0 only if (i,j) is an edge of G. Then how efficiently can we represent (or approximate) U as a product of unitaries that are “local” with respect to G? This is a vague question, but see my paper with Ambainis for ways of making it precise.
Given n bits arranged in a √nx√n square grid, suppose we want to know whether every row contains at least one ‘1’ bit. Can we do this using an ~O(√n) quantum algorithm that is “local” in the sense defined by myself and Ambainis? Can we beat the trivial upper bound of n3/4?",6806,"['7dc2df9494a4a8d8cbef639528fab0ee6fef8f1a494bf200e0d773c7601dc836', '56d11b40f4f37d84e3b2b540aa7807bac9a5947de4049e7c26ec880ab7875505', '50473cb9d66bfbb8b109baff007c5886f87dd00373e897d080e6910edc697f2b', '1d53988f249fa732a4bb7ad89307ec4bc683ce7a3339b20c9615a0f406c1d557', '7e4c2839d3c8a8c4f38be4a144ade467f76d102e28a292bed9c41c44307feee2', 'ad4fc58c5645a1b67354a67ae6c1e4fa68f4a640fa28a015aace713f266faff4', '93cc675bbbf951bbb69bf83240a8a1c70d16e63a82c1f5c35ac68406079146db', '9762bf96ec649c9229a82768a9afb5e5a9aaac6267e7d8651f8082557e71cc67', 'b6a18b22f563a5b5e121db219d651cdecae84a2af40cd597f45182a93b6a614d', 'bfd7799f96ae303e6d38d352b8555209e024bc42739f861d7b9d8b7db71a041a', '3856460a054ec10a9f8828dc23d92832c4e442d1092f7377819402d8821328dd', '9286eb253a24a981f2f253e8d2005bcb2c9663c41535fde2d68942f4ee2a965e', '168585c4a3a17657c72f26a07ee950064c5b525abab0136a60c35071e2b634d5', 'c80d41ae2f289cb9098e6b17668f27225286e94499ee9f50467bfec021406681', '86362e94293d5726bcecd52185154203efdd21b1bcb877a1a273714504987338', 'c543ef76fad25518be2c61aacc0ec5f7de660b207c86bdcfc4516748322a83e6', '893fc332d7f69d78feb78f693826d9c36ce4f265d03af132046ef6ce8367af6b', '3deb916c3684ecac125fee153acb56034fcca87594b8966a124e40d75bbf9aca', 'ae9e37cc05fe917bf47eea349af811ed6c5334ee68a2a42b94b5c5c685af8642', '276257635674111224fccee51ad204da3524e2af440f7de298b685b501fc59d3', '93605f82c20df98551df416f3c3c638211a064f65f6b0be01937b3b6dc59b643', '70770b0637a3e4fc0ae3f4dafe7e363714073504cb4141499af15a2a641fac6f']"

The main area of interest for this postdoc is quantum complexity theory, but I’ll also consider outstanding applicants of a more classical bent—in fact, the ideal applicant is someone equally excited to tackle meaty open problems in quantum complexity, classical complexity, or any combination of the two. As a postdoc here, you’ll collaborate (I hope) with me and my PhD students, but you’ll also have plenty of opportunities for interaction with the other quantum computing theory folks at MIT (Peter Shor, Ed Farhi, Seth Lloyd…), as well as the other computational complexity folks (too many to list). This postdoc is for one year, with the expectation of a renewal for a second year.
If you’re interested, email your CV, a link to your homepage, and what you consider your top 3 or 4 publications to aaronson@csail.mit.edu, and also arrange to have 3 rec letters emailed to me. Feel free to apply even if you previously applied for other postdocs at MIT: this is a new opportunity that’s somewhat different from previous ones. The application deadline is, shall we say, December 1st? Let me know if you have any questions.
Finally, while I was tempted to make “reading Shtetl-Optimized” an effective prerequisite for the postdoc, feel free to distribute this call for applications more widely.",1500,"['ba9a7b64a3f8d016ce0535982bd520b5ca0a19257e0b5ff5a79af783e374aaa4', 'c323098ea180a26f784098e11bbbdffb2b0daa7a5c4ac5dfde3528106fcc7271', '39394dd79ee6b1798302b8d85ad4309fb59c0430b675efb7b61644c178746622', '54cf2d0026f26f2406507cea647f2111e4493713f457412608ec450f621b9c1b', '70bc5ef713b89e335759bee44f289d796b573b03139a40d226a6e5bda7a6e18a', '9c31f6e8b869d672d1466c693cd5a8beca23a787c78cff3d3f829b7bdd765c7a', '7d44e9adc641188a70f7fc2908f2454c5f20b963122b60808d6f98f1a6cd8df6', '66130008b2564989379dd27017a761873fb8308216898208bb8d0931f8dbbdfe', 'ffcc936f6dcccf3424b5218255896778b0a391513e8ebbc602f90eaeb429fc80', 'daf0b4e694b79ebb3ea2402c884b06e099e69c61143550f237e3a1305e8e2ee2', 'b59b45c72430ebcdd6f9b1c33c5290f2f55f7cc409b72a0fd97db2482d7615bf', 'abc53634fca6a0bd5bb9f645622a5dd819bdcddccfaf3a0cec459a0238a56906', 'ade5e2c72515de6f1c6cf84683ea0384a6ddcdf4da3688f331f92e3d96cfcb3e', 'a7138965f9a97b24a903f96ed45a79459db8b18c8e550d3d1cdbbb4de629a93c', '9c61edfbf8c8e315af84bbc775eabd8c7665798c1b3753973cd5ca68d060b8fb', 'c5c69edb3603151dd434aba63be5996f16c1a176d8c087f26afb6646dac0551d', '4acd13eb2ed391d4468c718701de66996d1ba14584637ef41ddf6f126f6db5f0', '2e37bff2dd685d24a502b5eb7992b8aebd49860e65dff3349a73fa6d4cceb84b', 'e0917ac27b72a60d9c565104f803673afa26feec279fcc9cab7961f362163d3c', 'ac8a06529f1307e681a3935eeaf2f15f6609b6b439a10372a04d787e7f318aef', 'a5b05b7621c460a7c119eee6af8a423812a16d56f60e22942506e2673b8c344e', '91a37e7fc08cc498c6b6c429935801142fa875903d7cc0c7db65d19e58849845', '3f7be03e898462311525ceb7e1803f870db2150c924061a9c69646c4bb6bdea8', 'c8eb93360099d1e61a29f677bb1f5c2e63ab1c97608837bd4e597d0b55de1a98', 'a030545c49ea732e5cccc12b61c43a6efc79ff4d5c57d57308f5d058f809d6f0', 'd3398621ef734d3c65b167d796ff4f2e172561b01a89b59c3d8a59e8a0802f03', 'b9d7db142c0856caa1edca3d08509e401366e0549b0110150536ad6e87b331cb', 'dca8cbf7d96a9f3c541ab4798368eab75586014025df7dcca7cca8a544056c75', '1ff08c530f44004cbcab032635f6895c8127661fadd693470bc4f78963e71e55', '7e261bed659f5977186d24816f7fe7ee958c569aec95e3d2f3d13d2298dd7f73', '2ccd2c81cef10344461e3bfe633f7b404c06bae86abb01794a6248bae4341915', '057746279007c08f40d48a9afc9e0427236bc8f59a66b381cb4b1eb8cee3e0fe', '0d9120caa8ecf7ac0785b74d773ccfc6f2a3ea3075bf557f0ee020cf813f7dc0', 'd46bbb4535f6408d05b3b86f89f3ac2752b5144afd788dd6035462359272e265', 'f75654a0bad078234806ebb24e47e7a27616b4875a7a1f51c8d9f7648517dea8', 'b1da6777ffc87d64a49ec3659461876886611deda6ab874a00d3fae4ff01769e', 'd076cb9bcb422cca49c10c5728aa6002e5463e99f32e807d5b876876b700e816', '58858940fc84132540db4308277540d799295f19539fd865ff36f730cb3ebee5', 'c6c70dc14925e2c52d00132b9767211716cb93f0c601fcd275bb096e52ef1352', 'c1fbeb960d541e02cba1ec9d06ec9511433b71ab28117cb5d798de4439614ced', '001d1aed3875e9970e3d7b678175e0f45113fe3d97655794a0466e06b9e5f480']"
213,461,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=461,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2010-08-22,Scott Aaronson,Bringing a sacrificial goat and n-bit string to the oracle,"I’ve been enjoying Athens and the coast of Greece for the past four days. I was going to take a day trip to Delphi, for the sole purpose of blogging about having “queried the Oracle” there, but I ultimately decided to confine this trip to the unrelativized regions of Greece.
However, I do have something else related to oracles that I’d like to blog about today. Last week I put out a preprint on the ECCC (that’s the Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity for newbs), entitled “The Equivalence of Sampling and Searching.” There, I use Kolmogorov complexity to prove the surprising (to me) fact that
- FBPP=FBQP if and only if SampP=SampBQP.
In other words: classical computers can efficiently solve every search (i.e., “functional” or “relational”) problem that quantum computers can solve, if and only if they can efficiently approximately sample the output distribution of every quantum circuit. (Note that, although this result involves the names of quantum complexity classes, it has almost nothing to do with quantum computing.) Anyway, when I gave a talk about this result at Hebrew University, Noam Nisan raised two excellent questions, neither of which I’d thought to ask and neither of which I knew the answers to:
- Is there an oracle relative to which BPP=BQP but PromiseBPP≠PromiseBQP? (In other words: an oracle that makes classical and quantum computers equivalent for language decision problems, but different for promise problems?)
- Is there an oracle relative to which PromiseBPP=PromiseBQP but FBPP≠FBQP? (In other words: an oracle that makes classical and quantum computers equivalent for promise problems, but different for search problems? Here FBPP and FBQP are the classes of search problems solvable in polynomial time by classical and quantum computers respectively—see my preprint for formal definitions of them.)
Affirmative answers to these questions would imply that any extension of my equivalence theorem to decision and promise problems would have to be non-relativizing. I’d be incredibly grateful for any thoughts about these questions, and will even offer a $5 reward for each one.
However, since I have a feeling that these oracle challenges won’t generate quite enough comments, let me now pour some gasoline on the fire. You may have noticed that what I did above, among other things, was to call attention to my own ECCC preprint. Up till today, I’ve had an informal policy of almost never using Shtetl-Optimized to blog about my own research, except indirectly (e.g., when I talk about open problems that arose out of my papers). I had three reasons for this policy: first, blogging about one’s own research always runs the severe risk of boring everyone. Second, after I’ve finished a paper, I’m usually bored with it; writing a blog entry that rehashes what’s already in the paper is usually the last thing I want to do. Third, and most importantly, I didn’t want to create the impression that I was using this blog to give my papers an “unfair advantage” over everyone else’s.
However, recently a consensus seems to have formed, among the community of disgruntled anonymous commenters on computational complexity blogs, that I’m some sort of clown who bets $200,000 against alleged P≠NP proofs for the sole reason that he’s unable to do any actual research of his own. While I ought to have the Obamalike composure to remain unaffected by such gutter-sniping, I have to admit that it pissed me off. To be sure, I am a clown who bets $200,000 against alleged P≠NP proofs instead of doing actual research.

Topics discussed include: the anthropic principle; how to do quantum mechanics if the universe is so large that there could be multiple copies of you; Nick Bostrom’s “God’s Coin Toss” thought experiment; the cosmological constant; the total amount of computation in the observable universe; whether it’s reasonable to restrict cosmology to our observable region and ignore everything beyond that; whether the universe “is” a computer; whether, when we ask the preceding question, we’re no better than those Renaissance folks who asked whether the universe “is” a clockwork mechanism; and other questions that neither Anthony, myself, nor anyone else is really qualified to address.
There was one point that sort of implicit in the discussion, but I noticed afterward that I never said explicitly, so let me do it now. The question of whether the universe “is” a computer, I see as almost too meaningless to deserve discussion. The reason is that the notion of “computation” is so broad that pretty much any system, following any sort of rules whatsoever (yes, even non-Turing-computable rules) could be regarded as some sort of computation. So the right question to ask is not whether the universe is a computer, but rather what kind of computer it is. How many bits can it store? How many operations can it perform? What’s the class of problems that it can solve in polynomial time?",1499,"['c44f0447c6b3a5d455fb9a8b3279a4b010e8632a0f1482b6f47310b97e08b484', 'cd002cfee9a1afd7fc21a5692019b79a32e43cc030f5be2a9ee394ddcd3306dd', 'b6ca8037dd0417c3299f2f0d4c3a269a028779bd9a2323eb46b7cba9b619ef6f', '0457c7bdc5823284777589b61a40c4c05e4518d11b8525443638997f07d7f413', 'fd8251af15162f5709de6b0316209251b4cc6e82dbc94418c7d8db5c687df3ed', '1e0efccff99edf2e2092750b34c41de3d840e5c299887bfc1ab01ea6005bd658', '01179e8b0dff1b5f99be6641e53bb603220b94f24779f1d080d11ac6f82d9f4e', 'dd66140447212792cf75b9ee778fe5d1a68264aa967a05e4f7dcb1ebfa9103e6', 'ab78ab087da5d0fadac5004922c5fd5bd6a2eb3ef8e98c43f9d8e0074e91365d', '05ed847478fa65128db26d4d82c56d1741f3dbd3db9079f83fa0d3df537b9914', '839784d2e6650d26d1dc42fe8044d12c705b4bf404a1dd47157e2aec56c95976', '5c4785f8868fa1bc5d6f69ee92cf6fdba9a48252a396fc53b8fb991fc899f698', 'de2b696e03d46720dd2fb76f11cd6d59d1ca6430273229ad627e4a1bbbce67a4', 'da8660c91393c5e6b5f01e8f4d9079a8b6bf1b646f2b763a5ced724bf081bb76', 'fa50ce2ee69c89542b2674642b673b8018791124041837aafb0df865900276f9', 'a380a9f757bf9deb7de4a1ef60cffdfe73b331acc9a94043fa641b5f37bceada', '6144ce68781ba12f94a25d934e48b5d3fa112bf523a6bf11362a2a0f3e42ba6f', '8ebbf2c4e5a828e8406abf71de3c394ba962e6d1dbaabe8f4a739887ca4017bb', 'a1544eb76a43e211f56077102ff29436b23c8f372c551ea7461748c521300768', '84628568f8fb72b8424b3a25d22d6ad2446b817a6c214e57d9436bbe857a7ae9', 'e4d643cae029d33c4f923a160a20d89a45cf692fd47c2dd31c366f76e512cb60', 'ac03eef9b3301675ca5741c6185ea9ac2b9d54c6e1463740aaf4bf0ca29939fb', '722113b74275f939604cf68d395545401e21131381f71c3da76fffa919848d3a', 'bb438c0b5ca54e84128d1c09ba42dc43da9f274813e438a91807d39939032f43', '0c2a318eed6308880f06820bd1bbf7b1abb083e9268a9701ed63368cc1341ec0', '07f067e96aaf532b891a1b2bd1f3985149b24bb143d0a5d3ab51659e67fad8d8', 'ba05f375110d8c9124917262ad324e50ec3a35fb953cb72330dc5cf86dc0198a', '8e1245e01622017b2e4d66db60a23ef37cbd46a856fce7859cead5050774796d', '3e406bd57083f03e5720da208bc03c517826fd17e646cfab62a77985c3857e90', '3754ca9a50ea4dc0e13dd4644124a1bafe214431d6d4c291c5a7ba65385ba72a', '9e2ec49e1eee9d9166b74721349a93ef0c894005e7e450b13c06a85644d609c5', 'a07a86a08b0f513dfc2c4584daf13b75dadff9d3973485520e867457b6d03dd4', '1fba33273d69931bdc3b260813bf67482fef9dbd0d6c5d09872547fd6545cb7c', '0ad77ba9f8affa462997884cd025704f19c6ea3f8aca1761a23550d82e844019', '0c1f731cef4761fae7770ef0624799fe096ac885c1705452b9cd89c63bafb85f', '7eae4f33a32950e7f064e3d9d522c2e23e2e424f71e12f9f015baf5590d930ab', 'b8bb05ba09eed9838a1bc4b3d8188466a539966cfe3bafb0c35b4ba2c6ca6b27', 'deb45ca7165f56804a957a1cf3ceceb4925497e439d0eb222b722c078b1fe25d', '990090bf4e682793aeee3c456064ecb94f1795e1b69571a5b4c8b75092f3cb87', '95be1ae4926c69b5de0f3b8f565db5969eeee698fc56e3c647d7dd207bd5c73e', 'c819eb1d31d44025047e2e0b28aab9648531e96c8592ba729f70afdf32236928', '6e5c43dbfd5e826d4079cdff73b846feb1d29ed25e98835e2238f7ab7bf9e7f1', '15bd2e442e79cfd7d5951dea566f7da72c268cdb42d28015893e428c4302c88a', 'b3bc0f6dceb58bf5ad8e086902a44b59028d50fae97227f11dd7e15b59ad9672', '18f02c5c5b136436d8f47079a33cab2ef0a01014c9604e4849549fd758d52de3', '8deaae852c934483dedbd0417f44f1d4f54f2571f14cfcbd0170dfd7cab7f983', '9d230c2d06705986e87b15c39c2d97bda3c7597598fe0eb3f353ac437fbfd35d', '1b62bd575d879b681d203d89f74e1002669f7a4f50a13e6cddd88ff93331d4b9', 'ea0d62423f9178d7124b21211ec463bc24b75837809117b55149a6c518542284', 'eb64ac95df1fddd554a70b836c3649b656bf1b77411c3d93643c2cb6ae38fe57', '0c211c8a0abf260659127835b0ce5c00d77770d6c136b1f5a51c3318b5724e88', 'f557861b748820561240322ccc16b94e1cec57f70caa308837cd9a5f9cda8ab2', 'a2f8b91e226dad684b3e294efc25f78232b8fe9ffe6dae8636521e05a9192c46', 'bc96db4a7df80c9c8649adf85efbb00130d0603a30cfffc23a03e141dc71d023', '68c0f4e624bea13ea34877ecb01464877850848146b3c32365648299c17e8b39', 'ccfd71a7231ec2fcf9484d0a86a05360bbd57c56810409d621b6aa2da556e01d', 'dee8d0737a666a2a732eb9978c8d33b6b4cf1b796b6e65ef50dacec5f9ecdf1e', 'e46a1758b89d5dd6e2a6cbb4d8ecdaf2b58cb318cd11dbd537d7272f5c287867']"
215,451,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=451,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2010-07-05,Scott Aaronson,Doing my oracle duty,"I promised myself I’d stop blogging about controversial issues whose mere mention could instigate a flamewar and permanently get me in trouble. Well, today I’m going to violate that rule, by blogging about the difference relativized and unrelativized complexity classes.
Recently a colleague of mine, who works in the foundations of quantum mechanics, sent me a long list of questions about the seminal 1993 paper of Bernstein and Vazirani that introduced the complexity class BQP (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time). It was clear to me that all of his questions boiled down to a single point: the distinction between the relativized and unrelativized worlds. This is an absolutely crucial distinction that trips up just about everyone when they’re first learning quantum computing.
So I fired off a response, which my colleague said he found extremely helpful. It then occurred to me that what one person found helpful, another might as well—and that which makes 30% of my readers’ eyes glaze over with its thoroughgoing duh-obviousness, might be very thing that another 30% of my readers most want to see. So without further ado, the two worlds of quantum complexity theory…
In the relativized world, we let our algorithms access potentially-powerful oracles, whose internal structure we don’t examine (think of Simon’s algorithm for concreteness). In that world, we can indeed prove unconditionally that BPP≠BQP—that is, quantum computers can solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers, when both computers are given access to the same oracle.
In general, almost every “natural” complexity class has a relativized version associated with it, and the relativized versions tend to be much easier to separate than the unrelativized versions (it’s basically the difference between a masters or PhD thesis and a Fields Medal!) So for example, within the relativized world, we can separate not only BPP from BQP, but also P from NP, NP from PSPACE, NP from BQP, etc.
By contrast, in the unrelativized world (where there are no oracles), we can’t separate any complexity classes between P and PSPACE. Doing so is universally recognized as one of the biggest open problems in mathematics (in my opinion, it’s far-and-away the biggest problem).
Now, Bernstein and Vazirani proved that BQP is “sandwiched” between P and PSPACE. For that reason, as they write in their paper, one can’t hope to prove P≠BQP in the unrelativized world without also proving P≠PSPACE.
Let’s move on to another major result from Bernstein and Vazirani’s paper, namely their oracle separation between BPP and BQP. You might wonder: what’s the point of proving such a thing? Well, the Bernstein-Vazirani oracle separation gave the first formal evidence that BQP “might” be larger than BPP. For if BPP equaled BQP relative to every oracle, then in particular, they’d have to be equal relative to the empty oracle—that is, in the unrelativized world!
(The converse need not hold: it could be the case that BPP=BQP, despite the existence of an oracle that separates them. So, again, separating complexity classes relative to an oracle can be thought of as a “baby step” toward separating them in the real world.)
But an even more important motivation for Bernstein and Vazirani’s oracle separation is that it led shortly afterward to a better oracle separation by Simon, and that, in turn, led to Shor’s factoring algorithm.
In a sense, what Shor did was to “remove the oracle” from Simon’s problem. In other words, Shor found a concrete problem in the unrelativized world (namely factoring integers), which has a natural function associated with it (namely the modular exponentiation function, f(r) = xr mod N) that one can usefully treat as an oracle. Treating f as an oracle, one can then use a quantum algorithm related to Simon’s algorithm to find the period of f, and that in turn lets you factor integers in polynomial time.
Of course, Shor’s algorithm became much more famous than Simon’s algorithm, since the implications for computer science, cryptography, etc. were so much more concrete and dramatic than with an abstract oracle separation. However, the downside is that the speedup of Shor’s algorithm is no longer unconditional: for all anyone knows today, there might also a fast classical algorithm to factor integers. By contrast, the speedup of Simon’s algorithm (and of Bernstein-Vazirani before it) is an unconditional one.",4438,"['0f3b84dfff9485303d7ee90c9db7f582957bea3bc50798d4771fcbf3d40a5d5b', 'c3ddfe694f1829df7e1097fcc66d5362efbbbe55723c3c0b79d5812023c08862', '43c5fb584338b0b3680a823425d47f8571c864591860bc46aed89018bba0eff2', '339025f7a36e6dda1844af560c944af091c7c7788be67d7087b5887b41098049', '596a690bc2d0238ae62672878e4ee428858853d9c93e12e41a33829250fc1d00', '6a20a74b266e0a28b5266c8c51087efa00c714e3293d9abd3649be35922613a8', '5b715030e08aa34554c4fa79c851169af60f009bedfc44ab06c872df0cced302', '83e780913dde9885d594cbc2eb1da3ac21cbe73ad2d5ce9e4f6b33eced370819', '482c406fbf73d30e3fad9b764f0bdd7cad69d3e166c0343bdd44594abe04e056', '7f9267593295c6b8ad22b5d2f0fcb57e95c6e4f42c1d9d45dfc096d3fc23bbb5', '80c4c451472fca0a2ffed1ae1fde0607c4906225bd282f3b50e4669f764b460f', 'f3501f9315f15b2db35560489025b3daa98a33ee088be5b6415d20ff4d810593', 'e49c0a425a55ccffb9f389d0bf494588dc3d9c51bd7627b880bfb4976ceeaba3', 'a93a14f653855948a6f6e2c5a8d2dd303f47a95a5842363624827518ff42a617', '1b260f02e75b422c127d9b9e7c2cce1cdedaeddde8a788a31a8c6d8b5bedf2c3', 'dd417c8d95208c5adf6b288d8a130bebc76946547ad247d9c285b0914eea161a', 'c3c849a32a3ebde2c79b7244a239bc0a83b390f5c765c78815d11f37b39a2de1', '1d25d59286e5d96a7e2a98de411857e59cc6ed6b39ca09b2378c8c50538ec140', 'b8cff5f962eeda872407bd25a779e83fedd8575eada68a862a5251b4b1338068', '0e37d870788a4473668d462b89724cf71f56113502b882d7be0461bb277cc5b4', '188474df8e467790ae2348f30fcc844108813d71ad28d48689cd142ed32ac27b', 'f04f5bb7c720a8672d002ef7d9a1a555f13913408c6611b32cdbc3f3df714a4d', 'f28ec3e9783d4f17b311bef9b6b53db093097d3e775574a07e509f25c73dcd49', '426d816cfbf1b5949fd48239121a0d55309ae9fb92929adcaecc32af3a870920', 'e043c1979426817e44aaef7b65ce306967bef1530c5f27c3c84c62f51368ca4e', '0ed572c78f7478473c3437d6f9acdc099188a226e89ce0d7f32d6aad6a2fde9c', 'e6e36cd66ed133f9eb64933af7c88c266d5cd70843aa263775042fcf8d171c0f', '8aae9d96d657bc331427258a05f451edd932d025300bd10a8309c63e9b39062b', '9da86c8c2b5e5707a413c6642625bb5a0c9c13c2d65cb0c57cbc78fbd5743d92', 'c137a5019aa9b5231075fdbf45d7a94bd72f90adfb839a2df57f6515efa94583', '3af302fd54f9c1e37a532ea0b39a81e38da16cb646b40fea3ddfbbd2c5e84be2', 'b1cd736bfd087fc04f6eb9d9e246e627a6d2e4effbc2ed1094ead9100581a46c', 'ba547ecae98f04a5090b935ff0da6e35bb0267d0c7f9b034baa6055b1777e827', 'a3676f29f41a876dc2fdc87af43968392dd2f2710506a6484cb20bf210d4ff26', '6ceec8a903a2eca8455b16ad79e82f6a15af354aa93cc70ed4cc1e66d7736509', 'dd3dbbcbea8088cabfb07b7ee32be9dac72002b72f018b67363fae1aeb64682f']"
216,449,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=449,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2010-06-06,Scott Aaronson,Fighting Hype with Hype,"I’ve been depressed all month about the oil spill. So what better to cheer me up than a flurry of comments and emails asking me to comment on an Ars Technica story by Chris Lee, reporting that it’s now been proven once and for all that quantum computers don’t help with NP-complete problems?
Now, just to really put the screws on any optimists out there, a new paper has shown that adiabatic computers are actually quite bad at hard math problems …
What [the researchers] have shown is that, when adiabatic quantum computers are used to solve NP-complete problems, the energy gap between the lowest energy state and the next state up is not well behaved. Instead, it narrows faster than exponentially, meaning the adiabatic quantum computing cannot, even in principle, solve NP-complete problems faster than a classical computer …
In the end, they conclude that NP-complete problems are just as hard on an adiabatic quantum computer as on a classical computer. And, since earlier work showed the equivalence between different variants of quantum computers, that pretty much shuts down the possibility of any quantum computer helping with NP-complete problems.
I don’t think anyone in the field will be particularly surprised by this. The failure of earlier work to show that quantum computers offered a speed-up on any NP-complete problem indicated that it was likely that it simply was not possible.
I’m heartened by the progress we’ve made these last ten years: from overhyped and misleading claims that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, to overhyped and misleading claims that they can’t.
The link to the paper from the article is broken, and the article doesn’t give the names of the researchers involved, but from the context, I’m pretty sure the article’s attempting to talk about this paper by Boris Altshuler, Hari Krovi, and Jeremie Roland, amusingly entitled “Anderson localization casts clouds over adiabatic quantum optimization.” This paper really is an interesting and important one—but alas, the Ars Technica story grossly misstates and exaggerates what it does.
For what I hope will be the last time, but I’m sure won’t: yes, almost everyone in the field believes it’s true that quantum computers can’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. But we have no idea at present how to prove anything of the kind. In fact, we don’t even know how to prove classical computers can’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time (that’s called the P vs. NP question; maybe you’ve heard of it!). Nor do we even know how to prove a conditional statement, like “quantum computers can’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time unless classical computers can also.” Any such result would be the biggest advance in theoretical computer science at least since I was born.
So then what do Altshuler, Krovi, and Roland do? They consider a specific quantum algorithm—namely, the quantum adiabatic algorithm with linear interpolation—applied to random instances of an NP-complete problem, namely Exact Cover. They then argue, based on a combination of numerical simulations and perturbation theory approximation, that the spectral gap decreases exponentially (actually, like 1/n!), which would imply that the adiabatic algorithm generally requires exponential time to reach the ground state.
If that sounds pretty interesting, you’re right! But what’s the fine print? Well, let’s accept, for the sake of argument, Altshuler et al.’s claim that their conclusions about Exact Cover would likely generalize to 3SAT and other standard NP-complete problems. Even then, there are three crucial caveats, all of which the Ars Technica story ignores:
- Most importantly, the limitation (if it is one) applies only to one specific algorithm: namely the adiabatic optimization algorithm (with a specific interpolation schedule, but let’s ignore that for now). Now, some people seem to think a limitation on the adiabatic algorithm implies a limitation of quantum computers in general, since “adiabatic is universal”—a buzzphrase that’s caused a lot of confusion. In reality, what Aharonov et al. proved, in a beautiful paper six years ago, is that the adiabatic model of computation is universal. But they were talking about something much more general than the adiabatic optimization algorithm. For example, the ground state of Aharonov et al.’s adiabatic process is not the solution to a combinatorial optimization problem, but rather a “history state” that encodes an entire computation itself.
- The Altshuler et al. paper talks about random instances of the Exact Cover problem—but the uniform distribution over instances is just one particular distribution. Even if the adiabatic algorithm doesn’t help there, it’s possible that there are other natural distributions over instances for which it exponentially outperforms (say) classical simulated annealing.
- Finally, even given the above two caveats, Altshuler et al. only show that the adiabatic algorithm fails on random Exact Cover instances at a “physics level of rigor.” In other words, their argument relies on a “perturbative approximation” that seems plausible but isn’t proved. A cynic might retort that, at a “physics level of rigor,” we also know that P≠NP! But such a cynic would be unfair. I don’t want to knock Altshuler et al.’s contribution. For almost two decades, there’s been a spectacularly fruitful interaction between the physicists and the math/CS folks in the study of random constraint satisfaction problems. Indeed, many of the conjectures (or, in physics lingo, “results”) in this area that the physicists derived using their hocus-pocus methods, were later rigorously confirmed by the mathematicians, and I don’t know of any that were disconfirmed. Even so, the distinction between a proof and a “physics proof” is one that seems worth insisting on—especially in theoretical computer science, an area that’s often far removed from conventional “physical intuition.”
In summary, while it feels like swimming through a burning oil slick to say so, I have to side with D-Wave about the Ars Technica piece (though my reasons are mostly different).
So congratulations, Ars Technica! Like The Economist before you, you’ve successfully cast clouds over yourself when reporting about stuff I don’t understand.

217,446,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=446,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2010-05-22,Scott Aaronson,"What’s taking so long, Mr. Babbage?","Recently a journalist asked me why we don’t yet have quantum computers. Since I get that question, in some form, at least 300 times per day, I thought it might be worthwhile to collect my thoughts about it in one place. The essay below doesn’t say anything that I and others in the field haven’t said many times before, so hardcore Shtetl-Optimized fans should probably skip it. (Don’t worry, I’ll let y’all know when I have something new to say and am reckless enough to say it.)
When people ask me why we don’t yet have quantum computers, my first response is to imagine someone asking Charles Babbage in the 1820s: “so, when are we going to get these scalable classical computers? by 1830? or maybe 1840?” In that case, we know that it took more than a century for the technology to catch up with the theory (and in particular, for the transistor to be invented). More generally, we have lots of precedents for a technology being imaginable decades or even centuries before it became technologically feasible—heavier-than-air flight is another example. So there’s nothing weird or anomalous about our current situation.The central technological obstacle to building a scalable quantum computer is well-known, and is decoherence, or unwanted interaction between the computer and its external environment. When information about a quantum state leaks into the outside world—by any means whatsoever, intended or not—the state loses its “quantumness” and reverts to being classical. So to do a quantum computation, it’s necessary to keep the qubits (atomic nuclei, photons, or whatever else they are) almost fanatically isolated from their environment. But at the same time, you also need to manipulate the qubits, move them around, etc., in such a way as to carry out the computation. Those twin requirements are the reasons why the most famous ‘success’ of practical quantum computing to date was factoring 15 into 3×5.
Indeed, the problem of decoherence is so severe that you might even conjecture that building a quantum computer is impossible in principle. However, by now people have thought pretty hard about that possibility, and have failed to find any fundamental obstacle to quantum computing. Indeed, the starting assumption that quantum computing “must be impossible” hasn’t led to a research program with any real successes.
On the positive side, by contrast, in the 1990s computer scientists and physicists developed the beautiful theory of quantum fault-tolerance, which shows that, as long as you can get the decoherence rate below a certain finite threshold (which current estimates put at somewhere around a 10-3 probability of failure per qubit per gate time), you can fix the errors caused by decoherence faster than you introduce new ones, and thereby perform an arbitrarily long quantum computation. (I like to think of this fault-tolerance threshold as analogous to the critical mass for an atomic bomb!) So, today there are large research efforts in two directions: on the experimental side, to push down the decoherence rate, and on the theoretical side, to find error-correction schemes that can cope with higher decoherence rates. Hopefully those efforts will “meet in the middle” someday, and then we’ll have quantum computers!
However, long before we see general-purpose quantum computers, I predict that we’ll see a proliferation of special-purpose quantum simulators—basically, quantum computers that are tailored to some specific physics, chemistry, or optimization problem. Indeed, arguably we already have that today, in that we have plenty of many-particle entangled quantum systems (such as high temperature superconductors and quark-gluon plasmas) that we don’t know how to simulate efficiently on a classical computer. You could think of all these systems as “quantum computers” that compute their own time evolution! From this perspective, the challenge is “merely” to get a programmable quantum computer, one that can solve a problem of our choosing (like factoring a huge composite number). But I can easily imagine gradual steps in that direction from what we already have over the next couple of decades.
Finally, maybe it’s worth mentioning that there have already been some significant spinoffs of quantum computing in classical computer science (see here for a beautiful survey of them). Also, as “ordinary” transistors get closer and closer to the atomic scale, I predict that ideas from quantum information science will be increasingly relevant, if only to suppress the quantum effects that the chip designers don’t want!",4569,"['1c8fa8317f9901f006733683a061b17e7a9213dc50bc78012e7d3142f0256750', 'cfe5b4f561c3fbed7b4624b973c1b200e777db0a46049287ed8242cf1b685d36', '8dfda039867d420f6980719526d51418e8908e0faf491d9c1bbe530ebf697b28', '2f9871f275b8d84c7e275f0a1e1c8a14f4d8519f1d373b2086fef6b48adfc4e4', 'dc67864b50f8474743ed20d3ad969ba4915a2ff48513be7c444c65b6d303e52f', '0b2b3b8fc3bb01fbd50ce7df94305002db1edb231b6137009b117b9dd4a52828', '8abd89640a2232f16f920bdad4cd2fdcd01da129cb298d8abd46f9d6830b8d63', '5837206f0be3280dcd6eab7df34928d1b9d46469ecda9bfc9ed998889603adc6', 'd66d8fea640ed3aac214c7148f0670e6d96d26bd0e21a8700949f335ad001088', '20e28188f0a62b46a178157325f4321f11ac7e3fb5ea0c190aecfe4a79356737', 'a88435865d227c5cd225ce05164d45d8798c09bdf87db1c854eba424b40ae70a', '63db161420b6a7fa419459fc8d1134e6c9a1cfcca1cefc2bdeb0a47d80c0b622', 'ff99ea57557b02d1bc6d92f9822c677427b8f665b6e9d4b2db9eabac4fa4dda3', 'f21c8bf40e08be1ea8f0b014bfd1c4bfeddc9281cd2c0d38f89b551a0a2bece7', '7d19f8501c2a8555a15775fa1cb0674da16323153d39ecb673454e9af3fa3c5d', '903464c861ea7c738ea49c2dfebe4706acdc255bbd1174ca09f66a35ab5d8392', 'deaff47d296f6b3340ef258f6dec647d46886cdd5de4ee85fb1b8ce9c6a025ec', '6cde9937431d0565d59f62a4d699d901334dc4f88efe409f01f632257ae2e533', '0d1c47b657a3622fbc03e4a2056f7eacaffa8c12d656719a12f7fe469af73da1', '3e0e83f994d05bef58372a0ad50dd334bb91393f14ba3eec051413c115ada4ba', 'cd3def3e8a8ac896af59b0fc75d66c155b59c6dacbe770d2a22fe74df21cc82b', '4bc672fc1dfd2819561b984b30880cb3cf4be8fec03b68bbc9539cfd91d078eb', '9d33fba89df620a2a36f28f5dd87e9c9df187e0eba0d908406ff958002828a52', '78d65c4a3c5ca9391b383e744d89f992b5221b7ca33c483dceec7c68c847adfb', 'cdf5275d8e39ccc39885c72495570a21c384781b520e2e01b4853228c4218e9b', '928df8ff0c4639aabaeff48077d02d12c13c010f70c827ce55645782920a4ed7', '030fcd8052e6949d88b03f0b566faef6de50bc4bdaf9c80460856574dfa69380', '1609ee7e9316ed4dc0da12c4d814ea7463182d95416611f4e13febad0af4ee13', '6f5e283700c1b1a6b8d1d1bf022f10c2073a5329e27e5fd6fa0f66590aa54ef5', '6d1fa229cfbb8d7627f123bea8adc1714e6bd417f8ec36195b53bdaa1b3fa606', '5ce458185920f3ca174a577525404df37ee2d25b10c656c6e0e16542f57b0dee', 'ab6150bfe54cfb19d3dc9c39f58be671c1caf46272f3d4d58e34a1d5eaf881d9', '6c2ee8076476ae0fa68f1f464ca51031a74df16380ea57f263cae594a8f7db01', '5870db3452867e3f7c338731199f2f619a5d67cd02559af13c5bf101a498197f', 'f68e2ee96a15ae45e5b36cecb2fed387d41c7a903b45a2ba6f918c37ffa65dba', '8f8a1378ebcf6e3d9ebe005a5333b1f82d3f1eb3fc9e358a12491d1782607041', '0ed0bc16b9b37604945c5872d5491213a53b4ec784b1431f5f7deee7c8a6db4d', '035b25e2b9bab628fb9a2322fc6e9a78b46a8da51c61161490de60b95d1de38a', 'be8b90828d002bc85a337db1317985a52f3343a9c630911d857f0f5db08e29f1', '3ea243279cc3adea752b8401b88920be788822cb4d481dc9f95a8deb7d6d390a', '37de30665d122443af74d3f56061814531f0bd4bb95ea683369127987ef51e99', '9bef0012ca859a31234c194e352bf4b5bc8add02b6782e3ee0e1a4893b94ae31', 'c35f268e3704f98a34f989eb464867b59b04d6f88cc29223cd9f5c00d2675d6e', '64e34672ef9c90a2e19b8f89968c7a74f5dddb10df652e6c23525649e89fbc3a', 'fc1c7888184802ce717c7f4652419569232d4a4765b6399e07632cc13b41d041', 'bb2254ca00929e7f4ce899bc139540a6af1a5ae51fde97d1e7592e298a37b4ab', '8e56354c81a6151f810732c8f465ceb106277691470b19e17dfb971ec0548c7f']"
218,444,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=444,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2010-04-15,Scott Aaronson,Schrödinger’s cash,"There’s an article in this week’s New Scientist by Justin Mullins about unforgeable quantum money. By the standards of “quantum mechanics journalism,” the article is actually really good; I’d encourage you to read it if you want to know what’s going on in this area. In particular, Mullins correctly emphasizes that the point of studying quantum money is to understand quantum mechanics better, not to mint practical QCash anytime soon (to do the latter, you’d first have to solve the minor problem of the money decohering within microseconds…).
My main quibble is just that I think the article overstates my own role! In my Complexity’09 paper, the main thing I showed is that secure quantum money that anyone can verify is possible, assuming the counterfeiters only have black-box access to the device for verifying the money. I also showed that, to get quantum money that anyone can verify, you have to make computational assumptions. (By contrast, Stephen Wiesner’s scheme from the 1960s, in which only the bank could verify the money, was information-theoretically secure.) But in terms of coming up with actual candidate quantum money schemes (as well as breaking those schemes!), the other members of the “quantum money club”—Andy Lutomirski, Avinatan Hassidim, David Gosset, Ed Farhi, Peter Shor—have been more active than me.
Two other quibbles:
(1) Mullins writes: “Then last year, Aaronson proposed a new approach that does away with the banknote and concentrates instead on the stream of information that represents quantum cash.” In Wiesner’s scheme, too, I think it was pretty clear that the “banknote with qubits stuck to it” was just a fun way to tell the story…
(2) The article does a good job of explaining the distinction between information-theoretic and computational security. But it doesn’t stress that, with the latter, we can’t actually prove that any of the “hard problems” are hard, without also proving P≠NP! (I’ll admit that the importance of this point is slightly hard to convey in a popular article, possibly because many people, or so I’m told, go about their lives without proving anything.) The best we can do is show that, if you could solve this problem, then you could also solve this other problem that people have studied for a long time. But in the case of quantum money, we don’t even know how to do that—which is what we meant when we wrote in our ICS paper that “it seems possible that public key quantum money intrinsically requires a new mathematical leap of faith.”
Considered as research topics in complexity theory, uncloneable quantum money, copy-protected quantum software, and so on are almost as wide-open today as public-key encryption was in the 1970s. That is, we don’t have a compelling intuition as to whether these tasks are possible at all: all quantum mechanics does is open up the possibility of them, which wasn’t there in the classical world. Unfortunately, in the case of quantum money, most of the ideas we’ve had for realizing the possibility have turned out to be insecure—often for non-obvious reasons. Assuming quantum money is possible, we don’t know what the right protocols are, what types of math to base them on, or how to argue for their security. So if you’re not impressed by the results we have, why don’t you try your hand at this quantum money business? Maybe you’ll have better luck than we did.

I wish I had something more useful to say about this tragedy, but I don’t.
For the past couple days, I’ve been at QIP’2010 in Zurich, Switzerland. I’d had premonitions, even before arriving, that this was going to be an unusually awesome QIP. Having been on the PC, I knew the strength of the technical program, and I’d learned that the turnout—320 participants—would be a record high. My positive feelings only intensified when I saw the following in the hallway of my hotel:
My buzz reached a fever pitch when I entered the lecture hall and found giant, gourmet Swiss chocolate bars on every seat.
But I only knew for sure that this QIP would rock when my erstwhile adviser, Umesh Vazirani, gave his opening plenary talk on “New bridges between computer science and quantum computation.” Umesh highlighted several developments, including:
- the relationship I noticed last year between the BQP versus the polynomial hierarchy problem and the Generalized Linial-Nisan Conjecture.
- the QIP=PSPACE breakthrough of Jain et al. (based on the recent multiplicative-weights update method from classical computer science).
- recent breakthroughs in lattice-based cryptography (most famously, Gentry’s fully homomorphic encryption system), which took inspiration from the quantum computing work of Oded Regev five years ago.
- the work of Broadbent, Fitzsimons, and Kashefi and independently Aharonov, Ben-Or, and Eban (for which I paid out pieces of the Aaronson $25.00 Prize), which lets a “classical” verifier (equipped with the ability to send single, unentangled qubits through a channel) verify an arbitrary quantum computation; and which Umesh illustrated by a story about a verifier investigating the claims of a shady, fly-by-night company called “Q-Wave.”
Umesh argued that the deepening connections between quantum computing and classical complexity theory—open problems in classical complexity being solved using quantum-inspired techniques, tools that weren’t available in the classical world until a year or two ago already being used for quantum purposes, etc.—represent one of the most exciting new developments in the field.
The combination of the chocolate bar (which I was already eating), and Umesh preaching so much truth from the pulpit, was heavenly.
Amazingly, subsequent talks managed to keep up the momentum. Daniel Gottesman spoke about his work with Sandy Irani on the quantum complexity of translationally-invariant tiling and Hamiltonian problems. By giving tools to say something useful about computational complexity even in cases where the only free parameter is the system size, Gottesman and Irani open up some exciting avenues for further work. Jordan Kerenidis spoke about the effort to prove an analogue of the Valiant-Vazirani witness isolation theorem for QMA (Quantum Merlin-Arthur). Stefano Pironio talked about how you can exploit the Bell inequality violations to generate a long random string starting from a short random seed, assuming only the locality of the laws of physics, and not assuming anything about the reliability of your randomness-generating devices. This observation, which I find to be of great conceptual (and conceivably even practical) interest, is related to the so-called “Free Will Theorem” of Conway and Kochen, as well as to a result I proved eight years ago in my review of Stephen Wolfram’s book. For Conway and Kochen, though, the motivation was to prove that “subatomic particles have free will” (a strange interpretation that I don’t by any means endorse!), while for me, the motivation was to prove that Wolfram was wrong. Neither I nor (as far as I know) Conway and Kochen thought about the obvious-in-retrospect application to generating random numbers. (Incidentally, if anyone’s interested, my talk slides from yesterday morning are here.)
There’s also been a great deal of excitement at this year’s QIP about the efficient simulation of quantum systems occurring in nature, using recent techniques for model-order reduction (including MERA, matrix product states, quantum metropolis sampling, area laws…).

220,431,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=431,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2009-12-17,Scott Aaronson,Hopefully my last D-Wave post ever,"Several people asked me to comment on an entry by Hartmut Neven in the Google Research Blog, about using D-Wave’s “quantum” computers for image recognition.
I said nothing: what is there to say? Didn’t I already spend enough time on this subject for 10400 lifetimes? I want to create, explore, discover things that no one expected—not be some talking-head playing his assigned role in a script, a blogger-pundit who journalists know they can rely on to say “f(X)” whenever X happens. Even if f(X) is true. Why can’t I just tell the world what f is and be done with it?
Then more people asked me to comment.
I set the matter aside. I worked on the complexity problem that’s currently obsessing me. I met with students, sent recommendation letters, answered emails, went ice-skating with my girlfriend.
Then more people asked me to comment.
And I thought: yes, I believe it’s vital for scientists to communicate with the broader public, not just a few colleagues. And yes, it’s important for scientists to offer a skeptical perspective on the news—since otherwise, they implicitly cede the field to those making dubious and unsubstantiated claims. And yes, blogging is a wonderful tool for scientists to connect directly with anyone in the world who’s curious about their work. But isn’t there some statute of limitations on a given story? When does it end? And why me?
Then more people asked me to comment—so I wrote the following only-slightly-fictionalized exchange.
Skeptic: Let me see if I understand correctly. After three years, you still haven’t demonstrated two-qubit entanglement in a superconducting device (as the group at Yale appears to have done recently)? You still haven’t explained how your “quantum computer” demos actually exploit any quantum effects? While some of your employees are authoring or coauthoring perfectly-reasonable papers on various QC topics, those papers still bear essentially zero relation to your marketing hype? The academic physicists working on superconducting QC—who have no interest in being scooped—still pay almost no attention to you? So, what exactly has changed since the last ten iterations? Why are we still talking?
D-Wave: Then you must not have read our latest press release! Your questions are all obsolete, because now we’re recruiting thousands of volunteers over the Internet to study the power of adiabatic quantum computing!
Onlooker: Hmm, an interesting counterargument! D-Wave might not be using quantum mechanics, but they are using the Internet! And their new project even has a cool code-name: “AQUA@home”! So, skeptic, how do you respond to that?
Skeptic (distractedly): You know, when I was eight years old, and dreamed of building starships and artificial intelligences in my basement, my first order of business was always to invent code-names—not just for the projects themselves, but for every little subcomponent of them. The second order of business was to think through the marketing aspects. What should the robot look like? What recreational facilities should be available on the starship, and what color should it be painted? It really, genuinely felt like I was making concrete progress toward realizing my plans. Sure, the engine and control system still needed to be built, but at least I had code-names and “design specs”! How many others had even gotten that far?
D-Wave: Who cares? This isn’t some children’s game. Keep in mind that we’re delivering a product—serving our customers, by solving the 4-by-4 Sudoku puzzles they rely on to keep their businesses running.
Skeptic: We’ve been through this how many times? A pigeon can probably be trained to solve 4-by-4 Sudokus. So the only relevant questions concern the details of how you solve them. For example, how do you encode a problem instance? How much of the work is done in the encoding procedure itself? What evidence do you have for quantum coherence at intermediate points of the computation? Can you measure an entanglement witness, to give people confidence that you’re doing something other than classical simulated annealing?
Onlooker: Hmm, those do seem like important questions…
D-Wave: But they’re based on outdated premises! Today, we’re pleased to announce that, using what might be a quantum computer, and might also be a noisy, probabilistic classical computer, we can solve 5-by-5 Sudoku puzzles!
Onlooker: Whoa, awesome! So we’re back to square one then. As long as D-Wave’s demos only involved 4-by-4 Sudokus, the skeptic’s arguments almost had me persuaded. But 5-by-5? I don’t know what to think anymore. Skeptic, where are you? What’s your reaction to this latest development?
Skeptic: …
D-Wave: That silence you hear is the sound of the skeptic’s worldview crashing all around him! But we haven’t even played our top card yet. Today, we’re positively ecstatic to announce that we’ve entered into an official-sounding partnership with GOOGLE, Inc. (or anyway, with someone who works at Google Research). Together, we’re harnessing the power of quantum adiabatic optimization to create the next generation of car-recognition systems!
Onlooker: WOW! This debate is over, then. I confess: D-Wave on its own did seem a bit flaky to me. But Google is the company born without sin. Everything they do, have done, and will ever do is perfect by definition—from building the search engine that changed the world, to running mail servers that only fail for an insignificant 0.001% of users, to keeping the Chinese people safe from lies. And, as Google is infallible, so too its 20,000 diverse employees—who are encouraged to spend 20% of their time on high-risk, exploratory projects—have nevertheless failed to come up with a single idea that didn’t pan out. Skeptic, show your face! Will you admit that, through grit, moxie, old-fashioned Canadian inventiveness, and the transformative power of the Internet, D-Wave has finally achieved what the naysayers said was impossible—namely, getting someone from Google Research to coauthor a paper with them?
Skeptic: Yes. I concede! D-Wave wins, and I hereby retire as skeptic. In particular, the next time D-Wave announces something, there’s no need to ask me for my reaction. I’ll be busy tending to my own project, codenamed ARGHH@home, which consists of banging my head against a brick wall.",6292,"['79116174cc8246f3a07bc15391a772534ef54c8b4e33a0d6bf3532ccd6ac3ce1', 'e80b01ed8e60df8d1a0e75063331e0f3d7173afa95d32f4ad64a73ae3c5d8913', '2e404021da87ea72552500ff67e49442a0a9dc6b1139a99bc046e6636bdfb6d2', 'a839a2f47978ba9cd587009de64909f23d620df676e29cabad29a59a27598e08', '224d3e237aec6919e009ba09ef60aad8e48356e17a1d339d7ce88387fe5228d6', '333bde19f7fcfd10d5dcd69229ceceb8567461caaf7b514b999347cea6415b38', '67d7b8211e4a42a227141e7be8bf9ac5887ff9d5fa7fb7a4f1a53ce9459ddd84', 'f93e9536a52551271e5ce0b180e13879f5bfa6e57d891404ff117a0760e3aabf', 'a8f3870c14019262788d80a6fb2db7b10b136028881909a573811d9d30f4ed38', '437a945cd80d128046695da3a26fdb74d6dbc5cdf83e64a3dafe53c2e480f840', 'c9dfa5b91fea39ee4d8d801cb704bf817edbcedc86302a2e2d7256a94b18e63f', '424a0d3dc3f82aa527ee90e04276fed3aba2c3098bd48f15118f0b92b8785292', '935e371eb2a0e2027a47af17bec249ed1bf5083bf0677d9a0a4b95b8eb89e714', '94c28769d11a75d57da4fc37b33d919c0c9a1fe231c4d5346e66f0e5fc745572', '2d214e25c9e1c8877d8dc422fff2c5177476e512c19804a2d0b9affaf5949a54', 'e593980a57e9808e1e08042df9000d39f8c51b00a54aef47d729768a10cc190c', '301c5e88ccc76b6d0b9dd5739a9f053bdbd8a2563dee85a715edb1fce6467628', 'd27f28cfba52abf82e8e25cff7d56c1fbd4bfd1f1797122217b95a005c201d9e', '7f726288925d4dc03ac5f8f0c2d7d833d1bcd4b8ef7d0819599294459e4b22e4', '7d8b0716378a094425b59c960ba5a8d73205e5f82d211ce361df75d2d682a74c', '39d2f8f81ad2258d067fd0673a60c4ecb83ce03d8b8c2bdb253eb86c111ab64b', 'c3c03637dc19b61e42bd2835abd499e4163c27d592407f0cbf61932b2c6112b3', '7fd397348cc7359905ab898565f481d9e4c616af4595002f1d82235932f7dbbc', 'ed2957bcd07095d94fbd62704e4150de9cdce3fbc7b5cecdccea1f97026135ae', 'ec310125354036869283f619f35c14353e60856da3f39ebd8b768e2b960e9cb0', 'd4425fc21dcaf60659600b5746a9a719374880fdffc78e9e46c7f61591712d31', '76fc15be72ff15b2bd99c7a5369032d9eaccc34cb3aeecb7b8f34b4b792866c1', 'a691db0653fa20e1ba3475f077d88241cadb9704970bfc4823c0a3b43360af9f', '5b23fa5a1528156113462739198db7df7df6c88da6779db523de4aa5b5915984', '161f1846f024060192281ff0a1b9bc359a41b891cfb9f28d67636f13510c0a89', '091220962fb0e7504780909b8c27e0e199f905910819ce648e8986f91ebd1877', 'd815c25e373dce62bc346d9be8a9a0620522e6b84a0056278e27b7462e8d7591', 'b122dbbee57262267910bae41c78cf204fa56786a24ebf222ca908bbdeef09dd', 'de5ac999d9e294e6dd4c8cd99f425ee9eaaa963e3ffeec758ab04be14110559e', 'bd2c002ce3c411249cd19a549bc76eae90e07ed576883407e66d2e18ddd0f60e', '53c020ecf7de39237e2468b4bec9f553425466abd7e704a249beeb5c13d1d35d', '9d2aeb85f9afced6dd745eeeaa3767942e26a591e9d7129b710a6e933c90e063', 'f08985ecb06396893f57ed1e7a71b5d7acec527d0be39d48a2a680c27a6776d1', 'aa9cf755dd2363554b8d24986918bb04e5ca6df2976f83d234509c39f359058c', 'e645f6456d595c2b707de788a8c4e70f75443cc921d4c8d17776f502c3a02931', '2ab6bc3e4539a2d6030912cf8accbfd8679357f2a7ab0a0226257701fc65ce63', 'c9ff05f23d95e806358e0c91d769c783a6f99408b109d633cc967144216fe922', 'ab46ff38ed195bf837748dd66023d0cb3bf0da8ef05dc27af1f65a9a58857ca3', 'd97d4b1d806eee9d2b242e0b2a68697d3cc8c4567b3d9ce57ad376b309ab8c82', '197b5f2bfc9938e868d10402ace76df2a1e9384119e2a6db33c1f3e31d4300c5', '8cb770046a9549a15fccfa81324c443c32fc12b7a5ecc3fd72eec81e9cb17373', 'fbb2a1fe370f4bec47bba1e8aea0045ff31e336662e8335c32fde94045d6ba7a', 'ec3373d00d057ef3e15e5e76f4fbf886e4d7666a5c8250194bed57c7bfc78fdb', 'd7048f5957e2a2859b49c0c9d691cce76560f6bee21b4625deaab40114845b96', 'd8d4928d90198c83a21cd460551b8f9e3fe44debb6026e16d5ee7ea01f4a77d3', '7efd7f93f9fe6cd6cc1a3f00f1aba37d8533df3331409e9dbb4cebbdd8cccd31', 'a1f7619e4c0fbe6fc947d41f04dcf7162554cc48c4d2fd2baaa4ddee5c1791ce']"

222,401,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=401,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2009-05-05,Scott Aaronson,The QIS workshop,"As promised, here’s my report on the Quantum Information Science Workshop in Virginia, only a week or so behind schedule.
I tried to be cynical—really I did. But despite my best efforts, somehow I went home more excited about quantum than I’ve been in a long time.
The highlight of the workshop was of course the closed, invitation-only, late-night meeting in the basement of NSF headquarters, at which a group of us hidebound quantum computing reactionaries plotted to keep the field focused on irrelevant mathematical abstractions, and to ostracize the paradigm-smashing entrepreneurial innovators who threaten our status. I don’t think I’ve ever heard so much cackling in the space of a single evening, or so much clinking of bone goblets. Stuff like that is why I entered the field in the first place.
But there were some other highlights as well:
1. In his talk on quantum algorithms with polynomial speedups, Andris Ambainis called attention to a spectacular recent paper by Ben Reichardt, which characterizes the quantum query complexity of any partial or total Boolean function f (up to a logarithmic factor) as the optimal witness size of a span program for f, and also as the negative-weight quantum adversary lower bound for f. Assuming this result is correct, it seems possible that the remaining open problems in quantum query complexity will be pulverized, one after another, by solving the associated SDPs for the optimal span programs. (Incidentally, using Reichardt’s result, it must be possible to prove, e.g., a Ω(n1/3/log(n)) lower bound for the quantum query complexity of the collision problem using the adversary method. This was a longstanding open problem. Can one say, explicitly, what the adversary matrices are in this case?) Alas, it also seems possible that span programs will turn out to be almost as hard to analyze as quantum algorithms were…
(1+√5)/2. Despite the obvious danger to the future funding of the entire field, by some clerical error I was released from my padded cell to speak about “Quantum Complexity and Fundamental Physics”. My “talk,” if it can be called that, was in my opinion neither rational nor integral to the workshop.
2. In her talk on blind quantum computation, Anne Broadbent (who’s also visiting MIT this week) described some beautiful new results that partly answer my Aaronson $25.00 Challenge from a year and a half ago. The Challenge, if you recall, was whether a quantum computer can always “prove its work” to a classical skeptic who doesn’t believe quantum mechanics—or more formally, whether every problem in BQP admits an interactive protocol where the prover in BQP and the verifier is in BPP. Anne, Joe Fitzsimons, and Elham Kashefi haven’t quite answered this question, but in a recent paper they’ve come close: they’ve shown that a quantum computer can prove its work to someone who’s almost completely classical, her only “quantum” power being to prepare individual polarized photons and send them over to the quantum computer. Furthermore, their protocol has the amazing property that the quantum computer learns nothing whatsoever about which particular quantum computation it’s performing! (Aharonov, Ben-Or, and Eban independently gave a protocol with the same amazing properties, except theirs requires the “classical” verifier to have a constant-sized quantum computer.) Anne et al. also show that two quantum computers, who share entanglement but can’t communicate with each other, can prove their work to a completely classical verifier (while, again, remaining completely oblivious to what they computed).
On top of everything else, these results appear to be the first complexity-theoretic application of the measurement-based quantum computing paradigm, as well as the first “inherently quantum” non-relativizing results. (Admittedly, we don’t yet have an oracle relative to which the blind quantum computing protocols don’t work—but the protocols rely essentially on the gate structure of the quantum circuits, and I conjecture that such an oracle exists.)
Rereading my Challenge, I noticed that “the [one-member] Committee may also choose to award smaller prizes for partial results.” And thus, yesterday I had the pleasure of awarding Anne a crumpled $10 bill, with an additional $5 contributed by Seth Lloyd, for a grand total of $15.00 to be shared equally among Anne, Joe, and Elham. (Update: Since I wrote that, Anne has elected to trade in for three signed and doodled-upon $5 bills.) (Another Update: A $12, or $15-$O(1), prize shall be awarded to Dorit Aharonov, Michael Ben-Or, and Elad Eban the next time I see them.) This is, I believe, the first time a monetary reward offered on Shtetl-Optimized has actually been paid out.
3. In a talk that was so good, you almost forgot it involved chemistry, Alán Aspuru-Guzik discussed applications of quantum complexity theory to understanding photosynthesis and the design of efficient solar cells (!). To give you a sense of how mindblowing that is, it briefly made me wonder whether I should reread some of John Sidles’ cheerful ramblings about the coming merger of quantum systems engineering with biology in the 21st century (of which, I predict, this very sentence will inspire dozens more).
So what then is the connection between quantum complexity theory and photosynthesis? Well, a few of you might remember my post “Low-Hanging Fruit from Two Conjoined Trees” from years ago, which discussed the lovely result of Childs et al. that a quantum walk on two conjoined binary trees can reach a designated end vertex exponentially faster than a classical walk on the same graph. That result interested me, among other things, because it can be shown to lead to an oracle relative to which BQP ⊄ SZK, which at the time I didn’t know how to find otherwise. But especially given the bizarre nature of the graph needed to produce the oracle separation, I thought of this result as pretty much the prototype of an irrelevant complexity-theoretic curiosity (which, naturally, made me like it all the more).
You can probably guess where this is going.
Shown above is a light-harvesting molecule (image snagged from Alán’s slides), which apparently is efficient at concentrating light at its center for essentially the same reason the Childs et al. quantum walk reaches the target vertex exponentially faster than a classical walk: namely, because of destructive interference between the paths that point backward, toward the leaves. According to Alán, what plants do to harvest sunlight is not entirely unrelated either (it also involves quantum coherence), and fully understanding these mechanisms in quantum information terms might conceivably be useful in designing better solar cells. To be fair, a part of me always did suspect that quantum oracle separations would turn out to be the key to solving the world energy crisis. I’ll point you here or here if you want to know more.
Incidentally, Alán’s talk had another, also extremely interesting part, which was about coming up with precise numerical estimates of the number of qubits you’d need to simulate the wavefunctions of (say) benzene, caffeine, and cholesterol. (Many of us have long thought that simulating physics and chemistry will be the real application for scalable quantum computers if we ever build them, practical long before breaking RSA and ultimately more useful too. But it’s not something we often talk about—ostensibly for lack of meaty things to say, really because we don’t know chemistry.)
4. In her talk, Dorit Aharonov posed an open problem that I now have no choice but to inflict on others, if I don’t want to feel forced to think about it myself. So here’s her problem: how hard is it to find the ground state of a local Hamiltonian H=H1+…+Hm (that is, a sum of k-qubit interactions, for some constant k), if we impose the constraint that the Hi‘s all commute with each other? Clearly it’s somewhere between NP and QMA. It might seem obvious that this problem should be in NP—to which I can only respond, prove it!
There were also lots of great talks by the experimentalists.

Dear Scott, Please keep the focus of your blog. You have lately been losing science to your blog and started blogging about various loosely related things. One of the ways I subscribed to your blog was because your articles were very computation-oriented. Now you no longer keep the theme. And as you might have heard, shifting topics in your blog will lose your readers.
So today I noticed something bizarre. A celebrated result in cryptography, due to Goldreich, Goldwasser, and Micali, states that any pseudorandom generator gives rise to a pseudorandom function family. See Luca’s notes or the original GGM paper for more.
Now I’d always assumed, without thinking about it, that the GGM result “obviously” carries over to the quantum case—so that any pseudorandom generator secure against quantum attack would give rise to a pseudorandom function family secure against quantum attack. But now that I’m writing a paper that actually relies on this “fact,” I realized I have no idea why it’s true.
Look: in the GGM argument, you start with a pseudorandom generator G:{0,1}n→{0,1}2n, and you apply it recursively to produce a family of functions fs:{0,1}n→{0,1}n, where s is the seed. You then consider a hypothetical polynomial-time algorithm A that distinguished fs from a truly random function. You show how you could use A to create a polynomial-time algorithm that distinguished the output of G from a truly random 2n-bit string—thereby contradicting the starting assumption that G was pseudorandom.
The trouble is, the argument relies crucially on the fact that A examines only a polynomial number of outputs of fs—intuitively so that you can run a hybrid argument, changing the outputs that A actually examines one by one into truly random strings. But if A is a quantum algorithm, then (duh) it can examine all 2n outputs of fs in superposition! So any argument that depends on “watching A to see which inputs it queries” is toast.
But maybe we can recover the same conclusion in a fancier way? For at least seven years, I’ve been going around conjecturing the following:
Conjecture (): Let Q be a quantum algorithm that makes T queries to a Boolean input X∈{0,1}N. Then for all ε,δ>0, there exists a deterministic classical algorithm that makes poly(T,1/ε,log(1/δ)) queries to X, and that approximates Q’s acceptance probability to within ε on a 1-δ fraction of inputs.
My motivation for Conjecture () had nothing to do with cryptography. I was interested in whether we could rule out the possibility that P=BQP relative to a random oracle with probability 1. If Conjecture () holds—and if the classical algorithm is anything like I think it is—then we can’t rule it out, at least not without proving P≠PSPACE or an even stronger separation in the unrelativized world.
It now occurs to me that, if we knew how to prove Conjecture (), then maybe we could push through a quantum GGM argument using similar ideas—that is, by identifying a tiny subset of inputs to fs that the quantum algorithm’s acceptance probability “really” depends on. Alas, I have good reason to believe that Conjecture () is hard.
So the task remains: prove a quantum GGM theorem. Or maybe I’m missing something completely obvious?
PS. The promised report on the QIS conference in Virginia is coming tomorrow. Take that, future self!
Update (5/3): An anonymous commenter points out that we can use a simpler hybrid argument of Razborov and Rudich—which doesn’t break down in the quantum case—to show that if there exists a PRG that’s secure against 2n^Ω(1)-time quantum adversaries, then there also exists a PRF with polynomial seed length that’s secure against exponential-time quantum adversaries. That somehow hadn’t occurred to me, and it’s good enough for my purposes. (Masked cryptographer: emerge ye from the shadows, and claim thy rightful honour in my Acknowledgments!) On the other hand, the extremely interesting question still stands of whether one can prove a “strong,” GGM-style reduction: from PRGs secure against f(n)-time quantum adversaries to PRFs with linear seed length secure against f(n)Ω(1)-time quantum adversaries, for any superpolynomial f.",4183,"['4cbd9bfcd04409a2af08d8afc0bb9eb4449e4a2cd53f1f3c28d86d0acdb08d2d', '6fe88b55a80abf58672c5925587a7b906df190ea803ff01ebb569d1a603aa7c0', '8d1ae60755aa047583c4c33238e571c9e6ecddcdb4cdedfaaeb405b333847f03', '47d43326d27d2ab403a6bf5f32e836ef57cef1a43e73a56ddb3ce3b5aeb79a5c', 'a5ffe00291e53f6eaa25bce759e94c01dcd3ed78ef55f8ad00d17b7df759df44', '88f2342d0ddf3ee877cb28d618c0b1a191cc2a15f8d3270d5e9397dd6b29f56e', '5ab891e9d0a05d9f917309ed4d9ee30211c91ef9e1d3c1f4edd2fb6e581f293b', '93861b9e9aca1a4ab2324b47a8901daf443ab65b24efb99718a0f1461cc4aa71', '06fda90dba5fff31be261e619c9c2cb17737af25fb103fcaf461fcaf750f3039', 'a690de5492f1c2360820f0412cae4c63fc4b8583aac37011de681c2cb75cff97', 'f30b44cebf8bfbb07f626e9fa2595d10dacf5563e5ccd367dca346305cf292ea', 'cffaceedde9cf783fe2bf295831e51b8cd55c105824b8c9f59b082c3feddc268', '17a27dd549a78aea617f99b5a7d21bd9610b965fc93bcffa3969ce5a4307c1dd', '44f4f2f3b03c44b8833c56fa2c072a53e627756dd60e45262b562956ba10b08a', '06f72bed723a4b9d9e3dad8e9ca4b70f3b500711e9decb030c86a5567485363d', 'd77d9e5d17ccec2813a45da1665f194ec094b420b6123cf20216da771051cba8', '6c8c8370c1821a690699d54e02ec1e6779845258b20b5efe945a577c07fb142b']"

And so it is that I, on behalf of John Preskill, hereby encourage you to attend the Quantum Information Science Workshop in Vienna, VA, from April 23-25, which has been hastily called in response to the report A Federal Vision for Quantum Information Science. The whole quantum information community is invited, but the deadline for the workshop hotel rate is today! The future of our entire field will be decided at this workshop:
- Should more quantum algorithms be discovered, or not?

225,381,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=381,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2009-01-23,Scott Aaronson,"The arc of complexity is long, but it bends toward lower bounds","As MIT grad student Jelani Nelson rightly pointed out to me, an historic world event took place on Tuesday, January 20—an event that many of us have awaited for decades, one that we thought we’d never live to see—and I inexcusably failed my readers by neglecting to blog about it. The event in question, as everyone knows, was Mark Braverman posting to his web page what looks to be a proof of the Linial-Nisan Conjecture. The LN conjecture, posed in 1990, held that
Polylog-wise independence fools AC0.
Alright, let me try again in English. The conjecture says that no logic circuit, composed of a polynomial number of AND, OR, and NOT gates (of unbounded fan-in) arranged in a constant number of layers, can distinguish n input bits x1,…,xn that are truly random, from n input bits that look random on every subset of (say) n0.001 bits, but that could be correlated in arbitrary ways across larger scales. In other words, if such a circuit accepts truly random bits with probability close to 1, then it also accepts the pseudorandom bits with probability close to 1, and vice versa. If you want to distinguish the random bits from the pseudorandom bits with noticeable bias, then you need a more powerful kind of circuit: either greater depth (say, log(n) layers instead of O(1)), or more gates (say, exponentially many), or more powerful gates (say, XOR or MAJORITY gates instead of just AND, OR, and NOT). To a constant-depth, polynomial-size, AND/OR/NOT circuit (which we call an AC0 circuit for short—don’t ask why), local randomness looks just the same as global randomness. Or so says the Linial-Nisan Conjecture.
Now, we’ve known since the eighties that AC0 circuits have serious limitations. In particular, we’ve known lots of specific pseudorandom distributions that fool them. What Linial and Nisan conjectured, and Braverman appears to have proved, is that any distribution will do the job, just so long as it “looks random locally.”
A year and a half ago, Bazzi proved the Linial-Nisan conjecture in the special case of depth-two circuits, in a 64-page tour de force. Then Razborov gave an essentially 2-page proof of the same result. (Need I explain how awesome that is?) Braverman extends Bazzi’s result to circuits of any constant depth; his proof is almost as short as Razborov’s.
In proving these lower bounds, the name of the game is the polynomial method (the subject of my FOCS tutorial). Given an AC0 circuit C, you first construct a low-degree real polynomial that approximates C pretty well on most inputs. (How do you construct such a thing? And what does “pretty well” mean? Save it for the comments section.) Then you observe that no low-degree polynomial could possibly distinguish a random string from a string that only looks random locally. Why? Because a low-degree polynomial, by definition, is a sum of local terms, and if none of those individual terms can distinguish truly random bits from pseudorandom ones (as was assumed), then their sum can’t distinguish them either, by the deep principle of the universe we call linearity of expectation. (By contrast, an AND or OR of terms could in principle detect “global” properties of the input that none of the individual terms detected—which is why we couldn’t just apply such an argument to the AC0 circuit directly.) It follows, then, that the original circuit couldn’t have distinguished local randomness from global randomness very well either, which is what we wanted to show.
So everything boils down to constructing these low-degree approximating polynomials and proving they have the right properties. And in that context, what Braverman does is almost hilariously simple. Given an AC0 circuit C, he first constructs a low-degree polynomial p that agrees with C on most inputs (from whatever fixed probability distribution you want), using the celebrated method of Valiant-Vazirani and Razborov-Smolensky. He then observes that, when p fails to agree with C, there’s another AC0 circuit E, of depth slightly greater than C, that detects the failure. Next he finds a low-degree polynomial q that approximates E in L2-norm, using the also-celebrated 1993 theorem of Linial-Mansour-Nisan. Then he looks at p(1-q), and shows that it’s a polynomial that usually agrees with C, but when it does disagree, usually isn’t too far off. And then … well, at that point he’s really almost done.
While I had no involvement whatsoever with this beautiful result, I’m pleased to have unwittingly set in motion a chain of events that led to it. Since the summer, I’ve been trying to get as many lowerbounderati as possible interested in BQP versus PH, a central open problem of quantum complexity theory that’s resisted progress since the prehistoric days of 1993. (There are certain problems that I mentally classify as “rabbits,” after the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. BQP vs. PH is one of the fluffiest, most adorable rabbits ever to leap for my throat.)
Concretely, the goal has been to construct an oracle relative to which BQP (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-time, the class of problems that are feasible for a quantum computer) is not contained in PH (the Polynomial-time Hierarchy, a generalization of NP). Such a separation would give us probably our best evidence to date that BQP is not contained in NP—or loosely speaking, that not only can quantum computers solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical ones, they can solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers can even verify the answers.
(NerdNote: We do have oracles relative to which BQP⊄NP, and indeed BQP⊄MA. But we still don’t have an oracle relative to which BQP⊄AM. And that sticks in the craw, since we know that AM=NP under a derandomization hypothesis.)
Now, it occurred to me that BQP versus PH is closely related to the Linial-Nisan Conjecture. That’s not quite as surprising as it sounds, since you can think of PH as the “exponentially scaled-up version” of AC0 … so that fighting PH ultimately boils down to fighting AC0.
Alright, so consider the following problem, which we’ll call Fourier Checking. You’re given black-box access to two Boolean functions f,g:{-1,1}n→{-1,1}, and are promised that either
- f and g were both generated uniformly at random (independently of each other), or
- f and g were generated by first choosing a random 2n-dimensional unit vector v, then setting f(x)=sgn(vx) and g(x)=sgn((Hv)x), where H represents the Fourier transform over Z2n.
The problem is to decide which, with small probability of error.
It’s not hard to see that Fourier Checking is in BQP (i.e., is efficiently solvable by a quantum computer). For to solve it, you just go into a uniform superposition over all x∈{-1,1}n, then query f, apply a Quantum Fourier Transform, query g, and see if you’re left with (1) random garbage or (2) something close to the uniform superposition that you started with.
On the other hand, one can show that:
- A certain generalization of Bazzi’s Theorem (from “local randomness” to “local almost-randomness”—as usual, ask in the comments section) would imply that Fourier Checking is not in an important subclass of PH called AM (for “Arthur-Merlin”). And thus, we’d get an oracle relative to which BQP⊄AM.
- The analogous generalization of the full Linial-Nisan Conjecture would imply that Fourier Checking is not in PH. And thus, we’d get our long-sought oracle relative to which BQP⊄PH.
After realizing the above, I tried for months to prove the requisite generalization of Bazzi’s Theorem—or better yet, get someone else to prove it for me. But I failed. All I managed to do was to goad Razborov into proving his amazing 2-page version of Bazzi’s original theorem, which in turn inspired Braverman to shoot for the full Linial-Nisan Conjecture.
In what appears to be a cosmic prank, about the only conjectures in this area that still haven’t been proved are the ones I needed for the quantum computing problem. And thus, I will offer $100 for a proof that Fourier Checking is not in AM, $200 for a proof that it’s not in PH. In so doing, my hope is to make Tuesday, January 20, 2009 remembered by all as the day our economy finally got back on track.",8218,"['f787b5bf03be98b52a97db690f6b22e292415d149ef966b358dce5fcac70bf8c', '2eedd9cee8647b892c5ee27696e3a3fbd684385b15476f2237f57bfbc87ea3f0', '35126c2e321e4b08735bd633d1609cf36152e4e2d449880579b175fb1783601f', '48f296e2e394e2defbdbd398dc752245a7c2cebb423b3ede8fafbec7790936f8', 'f22c5e11e94a794a74a032e2b66a06a021f83a7f4b7fe726b9c4ae403aadc7d9', '214be72c7b533e420435143a80108e141fa0cb910a475884cabec4d3c0a50b95', '552bd7aa766262a7d056e19b875176cb2cf4230099244ac1ce723540f4164322', '964c4bde0e8eeaf43bb607309dfbab7fe64e48eee5dcbcb8e49fe229effa361e', '94ea815692e5219420c78bbf46db1cb678ce07b91ea314b5816d600703a5a842', '40de0c69573d2c6215d3511496f018b4072e9828b86a709beb2dd33c12002dbe', '384abfdabdc3599ac947d4e36b900c77f77ecbc6295414a65ec3f87c6b42249f', '771a0dac028022618c903156ccc14a95e982f82d5718a7281cd649014c26e9eb', '7c7d9b6d29b85b28e540270c7ee9107054b6be28dac1c2d19d5cbe07939b911a', '7b41923d61048832858e4bb4431d9de9954bae4b0235d7340c4b1146212e0692', 'c815ebf725132be6d54bf93ddde3dc3c40a0a1ee787cd063fdf0cac7f0144677', '2fd5bd23807d4650ac6cbefae2eda6e14bf13b7c6a5f5622cd735b553dcfab84', 'e7d558987dc2a6f418d6f5c8e42251d2cb29463620fa0bca82a3c37f0cc68832', 'f164c1c539f8a143c82ca229e2f7a6693506f58f3238b2ad3fbc1e9192afdd9e', 'bcc40caced6092442cb7bdbc11fd4dbcb5bab23b1118dc12cad1fd5c4f00fabb', 'ecadb2e3e2ec60aed706404ee039e11c7209a6e653bd01ac093bdbc2cec79a47', 'c4ddac33cf5a1de6e4104cef97fbbfc6d325a04f8874cf92911927d31fec3e8f', 'e1d3beed71528f5be9dfec25d8710d165952eaec4959bdd0455cd0d9759a3fd8', '89e8b4c27cc8f628b0ef7fff0c3b9b480b3cfca5853a8dee364e02e5729eb789', '99a6ad8e93ab8ea43b4e73e82a31b0ba883aa4dd4e55155e72b9b78b12a39c44', '8245982651c4fd77025bb9a7d45ba99bd11c021c70018a4b7b09220cb548173c', '678ae4c2ea6a5772c4661d37e4edf38a7f145e6e894fb83598c8838a86f1649a', 'a9331c3e2fa79513a1db8f7bd4a00d9b6f59b1a4dfa28670552118bf525d943b', 'dce011cc611210bd9edf0c0e605301399b4a4efcdc6521869ab2e8b44265b979', '0ead75f0e356a3266e46527ebfc1cc19c4d1335a878cc7c354d82fc94bfaaeea']"

I had to cancel a planned colloquium. I’m not even gonna try to describe what I’ve been coughing up. The doctor couldn’t figure out if it was viral or bacterial, but gave me antibiotics anyway.
My laptop broke, the day before I had to give my time travel talk at QIP’2009 in Santa Fe (if you want to know what actually happened at the conference, see Dave’s blog or ask in the comments section). First the fan started acting up—causing the machine to overheat and shut itself off whenever the computations got too complex; then the ‘G’ and ‘H’ keys became unreliable; and finally the hard disk went, taking much of my data along with it (though I recovered the most important stuff). So I ran out and bought a new Toshiba laptop, which of course came preinstalled with Vista, which is not just said by everyone to suck but truly does suck. (Though if you spend a day disabling all the new features, you can make it almost like XP.)
On the flight back to Boston from Santa Fe, the pressure drop during the descent, combined with my bronchitis, sent my ears into pain for days.
The shitty economy is no longer just an abstraction, as friends and close family members have lost their jobs. I, the starving quantum complexity theorist, now feel like one of the last people I know with an income. (Though MIT, like other universities, has lost much of its endowment and now faces serious hardships as well.)

I’m treating this as a much-needed end-of-semester vacation—with warm desert air, eccentric personalities, talks without theorems, and the sort of meandering philosophical debate I get inexplicably cranky if I haven’t had for a month. Just one problem: I was hoping Cosmic Variance‘s Sean Carroll would arrive to provide much-needed positivist reinforcement against the gangs of metaphysical ruffians, but the California Clarifier backed out—leaving the remaining skeptics to dodge relentless volleys of ill-posed questions only three hours’ drive from the O.K. Corral.
- My graduate course 6.896 Quantum Complexity Theory ended last week, with ten amazing student project presentations. Thanks so much to the students, and to my TA Yinmeng Zhang, for making this a great course (at least for me). Almost all of the scribe notes are now available on the course website. But be warned: not only did I not write these notes, not only did I not edit them, for the most part I haven’t read them yet. Use entirely at your own risk.
- Want to do graduate study in quantum information at MIT? Yes? Then my colleague Jeff Shapiro asks me to point you to the new website of iQUiSE, our Interdisciplinary Quantum Information Science & Engineering program (motto: “Further Depleting the Supply of Quantum Funding-Related Acronyms Containing the Letters Q and I”). If you’re interested, you apply to a traditional department (such as physics, math, EECS, or mechanical engineering), but specify in your application that you’re interested in iQUiSE. The application deadline is today—but if for some strange reason 17 hours isn’t enough to write your application, there’s always another year.

229,368,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=368,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2008-12-12,Scott Aaronson,Time: Different from space,"Over at Cosmic Variance, I learned that FQXi (the organization that paid for me to go to Iceland) sponsored an essay contest on “The Nature of Time”, and the submission deadline was last week. Because of deep and fundamental properties of time (at least as perceived by human observers), this means that I will not be able to enter the contest. However, by exploiting the timeless nature of the blogosphere, I can now tell you what I would have written about if I had entered.(Warning: I can’t write this post without actually explaining some standard CS and physics in a semi-coherent fashion. I promise to return soon to your regularly-scheduled programming of inside jokes and unexplained references.)
I’ve often heard it said—including by physicists who presumably know better—that “time is just a fourth dimension,” that it’s no different from the usual three dimensions of space, and indeed that this is a central fact that Einstein proved (or exploited? or clarified?) with relativity. Usually, this assertion comes packaged with the distinct but related assertion that the “passage of time” has been revealed as a psychological illusion: for if it makes no sense to talk about the “flow” of x, y, or z, why talk about the flow of t? Why not just look down (if that’s the right word) on the entire universe as a fixed 4-dimensional crystalline structure?
In this post, I’ll try to tell you why not. My starting point is that, even if we leave out all the woolly metaphysics about our subjective experience of time, and look strictly at the formalism of special and general relativity, we still find that time behaves extremely differently from space. In special relativity, the invariant distance between two points p and q—meaning the real physical distance, the distance measure that doesn’t depend on which coordinate system we happen to be using—is called the interval. If the point p has coordinates (x,y,z,t) (in any observer’s coordinate system), and the point q has coordinates (x’,y’,z’,t’), then the interval between p and q equals
(x-x’)2+(y-y’)2+(z-z’)2-(t-t’)2
where as usual, 1 second of time equals 3×108 meters of space. (Indeed, it’s possible to derive special relativity by starting with this fact as an axiom.)
Now, notice the minus sign in front of (t-t’)2? That minus sign is physics’ way of telling us that time is different from space—or in Sesame Street terms, “one of these four dimensions is not like the others.” It’s true that special relativity lets you mix together the x,y,z,t coordinates in a way not possible in Newtonian physics, and that this mixing allows for the famous time dilation effect, whereby someone traveling close to the speed of light relative to you is perceived by you as almost frozen in time. But no matter how you choose the t coordinate, there’s still going to be a t coordinate, which will stubbornly behave differently from the other three spacetime coordinates. It’s similar to how my “up” points in nearly the opposite direction from an Australian’s “up”, and yet we both have an “up” that we’d never confuse with the two spatial directions perpendicular to it.
(By contrast, the two directions perpendicular to “up” can and do get confused with each other, and indeed it’s not even obvious which directions we’re talking about: north and west? forward and right? If you were floating in interstellar space, you’d have three perpendicular directions to choose arbitrarily, and only the choice of the fourth time direction would be an “obvious” one for you.)
In general relativity, spacetime is a curved manifold, and thus the interval gets replaced by an integral over a worldline. But the local neighborhood around each point still looks like the (3+1)-dimensional spacetime of special relativity, and therefore has a time dimension which behaves differently from the three space dimensions. Mathematically, this corresponds to the fact that the metric at each point has (-1,+1,+1,+1) signature—in other words, it’s a 4×4 matrix with 3 positive eigenvalues and 1 negative eigenvalue. If space and time were interchangeable, then all four eigenvalues would have the same sign.
But how does that minus sign actually do the work of making time behave differently from space? Well, because of the minus sign, the interval between two points can be either positive or negative (unlike Euclidean distance, which is always nonnegative). If the interval between two points p and q is positive, then p and q are spacelike separated, meaning that there’s no way for a signal emitted at p to reach q or vice versa. If the interval is negative, then p and q are timelike separated, meaning that either a signal from p can reach q, or a signal from q can reach p. If the interval is zero, then p and q are lightlike separated, meaning a signal can get from one point to the other, but only by traveling at the speed of light.
In other words, that minus sign is what ensures spacetime has a causal structure: two events can stand to each other in the relations “before,” “after,” or “neither before nor after” (what in pre-relativistic terms would be called “simultaneous”). We know from general relativity that the causal structure is a complicated dynamical object, itself subject to the laws of physics: it can bend and sag in the presence of matter, and even contract to a point at black hole singularities. But the causal structure still exists—and because of it, one dimension simply cannot be treated on the same footing as the other three.
Put another way, the minus sign in front of the t coordinate reflects what a sufficiently-articulate child might tell you is the main difference between space and time: you can go backward in space, but you can’t go backward in time. Or: you can revisit the city of your birth, but you can’t (literally) revisit the decade of your birth. Or: the Parthenon could be used later to store gunpowder, and the Tower of London can be used today as a tourist attraction, but the years 1700-1750 can’t be similarly repurposed for a new application: they’re over.
Notice that we’re now treating space and time pragmatically, as resources—asking what they’re good for, and whether a given amount of one is more useful than a given amount of the other. In other words, we’re now talking about time and space like theoretical computer scientists. If the difference between time and space shows up in physics through the (-1,+1,+1,+1) signature, the difference shows up in computer science through the famous
P ≠ PSPACE
conjecture. Here P is the class of problems that are solvable by a conventional computer using a “reasonable” amount of time, meaning, a number of steps that increases at most polynomially with the problem size. PSPACE is the class of problems solvable by a conventional computer using a “reasonable” amount of space, meaning a number of memory bits that increases at most polynomially with the problem size. It’s evident that P ⊆ PSPACE—in other words, any problem solvable in polynomial time is also solvable in polynomial space. For it takes at least one time step to access a given memory location—so in polynomial time, you can’t exploit more than polynomial space anyway. It’s also clear that PSPACE ⊆ EXP—that is, any problem solvable in polynomial space is also solvable in exponential time. The reason is that a computer with K bits of memory can only be 2K different configurations before the same configuration recurs, in which case the machine will loop forever. But computer scientists conjecture that PSPACE ⊄ P—that is, polynomial space is more powerful than polynomial time—and have been trying to prove it for about 40 years.
(You might wonder how P vs. PSPACE relates to the even better-known P vs. NP problem. NP, which consists of all problems for which a solution can be verified in polynomial time, sits somewhere between P and PSPACE. So if P≠NP, then certainly P≠PSPACE as well. The converse is not known—but a proof of P≠PSPACE would certainly be seen as a giant step toward proving P≠NP.)
So from my perspective, it’s not surprising that time and space are treated differently in relativity. Whatever else the laws of physics do, presumably they have to differentiate time from space somehow—since otherwise, how could polynomial time be weaker than polynomial space?
But you might wonder: is reusability really the key property of space that isn’t shared by time—or is it merely one of several differences, or a byproduct of some other, more fundamental difference? Can we adduce evidence for the computer scientist’s view of the space/time distinction—the view that sees reusability as central? What could such evidence even consist of? Isn’t it all just a question of definition at best, or metaphysics at worst?
On the contrary, I’ll argue that the computer scientist’s view of the space/time distinction actually leads to something like a prediction, and that this prediction can be checked, not by experiment but mathematically. If reusability really is the key difference, then if we change the laws of physics so as to make time reusable—keeping everything else the same insofar as we can—polynomial time ought to collapse with polynomial space. In other words, the set of computational problems that are efficiently solvable ought to become PSPACE. By contrast, if reusability is not the key difference, then changing the laws of physics in this way might well give some complexity class other than PSPACE.
But what do we even mean by changing the laws of physics so as to “make time reusable”? The first answer that suggests itself is simply to define a “time-traveling Turing machine,” which can move not only left and right on its work tape, but also backwards and forwards in time. If we do this, then we’ve made time into another space dimension by definition, so it’s not at all surprising if we end up being able to solve exactly the PSPACE problems.
But wait: if time is reusable, then “when” does it get reused? Should we think of some “secondary” time parameter that inexorably marches forward, even as the Turing machine scuttles back and forth in the “original” time? But if so, then why can’t the Turing machine also go backwards in the secondary time? Then we could introduce a tertiary time parameter to count out the Turing machine’s movements in the secondary time, and so on forever.
But this is stupid. What the endless proliferation of times is telling us is that we haven’t really made time reusable. Instead, we’ve simply redefined the time dimension to be yet another space dimension, and then snuck in a new time dimension that behaves in the same boring, conventional way as the old time dimension. We then perform the sleight-of-hand of letting an exponential amount of the secondary time elapse, even as we restrict the “original” time to be polynomially bounded. The trivial, uninformative result is then that we can solve PSPACE problems in “polynomial time.”
So is there a better way to treat time as a reusable resource? I believe that there is. We can have a parameter that behaves like time in that it “never changes direction”, but behaves unlike time in that it loops around in a cycle. In other words, we can have a closed timelike curve, or CTC. CTCs give us a dimension that (1) is reusable, but (2) is also recognizably “time” rather than “space.”
Of course, no sooner do we define CTCs than we confront the well-known problem of dead grandfathers. How can we ensure that the events around the CTC are causally consistent, that they don’t result in contradictions? For my money, the best answer to this question was provided by David Deutsch, in his paper “Quantum Mechanics near Closed Time-like Lines” (unfortunately not online). Deutsch observed that, if we allow the state of the universe to be probabilistic or quantum, then we can always tell a consistent story about the events inside a CTC. So for example, the resolution of the grandfather paradox is simply that you’re born with 1/2 probability, and if you’re born you go back in time and kill your grandfather, therefore you’re born with 1/2 probability, etc. Everything’s consistent; there’s no paradox!
More generally, any stochastic matrix S has at least one stationary distribution—that is, a distribution D such that S(D)=D. Likewise, any quantum-mechanical operation Q has at least one stationary state—that is, a mixed state ρ such that Q(ρ)=ρ. So we can consider a model of closed timelike curve computation where we (the users) specify a polynomial-time operation, and then Nature has to find some probabilistic or quantum state ρ which is left invariant by that operation. (There might be more than one such ρ—in which case, being pessimists, we can stipulate that Nature chooses among them adversarially.) We then get to observe ρ, and output an answer based on it.
So what can be done in this computational model? Long story short: in a recent paper with Watrous, we proved that
PCTC = BQPCTC = PSPACE.
Or in English, the set of problems solvable by a polynomial-time CTC computer is exactly PSPACE—and this holds whether the CTC computer is classical or quantum. In other words, CTCs make polynomial time equal to polynomial space as a computational resource. Unlike in the case of “secondary time,” this is not obvious from the definitions, but has to be proved. (Note that to prove PSPACE ⊆ PCTC ⊆ BQPCTC ⊆ EXP is relatively straightforward; the harder part is to show BQPCTC ⊆ PSPACE.)
The bottom line is that, at least in the computational world, making time reusable (even while preserving its “directionality”) really does make it behave like space. To me, that lends some support to the contention that, in our world, the fact that space is reusable and time is not is at the core of what makes them different from each other.
I don’t think I’ve done enough to whip up controversy yet, so let me try harder in the last few paragraphs. A prominent school of thought in quantum gravity regards time as an “emergent phenomenon”: something that should not appear in the fundamental equations of the universe, just like hot and cold, purple and orange, maple and oak don’t appear in the fundamental equations, but only at higher levels of organization. Personally, I’ve long had trouble making sense of this view. One way to explain my difficulty is using computational complexity. If time is “merely” an emergent phenomenon, then is the presumed intractability of PSPACE-complete problems also an emergent phenomenon? Could a quantum theory of gravity—a theory that excluded time as “not fundamental enough”—therefore be exploited to solve PSPACE-complete problems efficiently (whatever “efficiently” would even mean in such a theory)? Or maybe computation is also just an emergent phenomenon, so the question doesn’t even make sense? Then what isn’t an emergent phenomenon?
I don’t have a knockdown argument, but the distinction between space and time has the feel to me of something that needs to be built into the laws of physics at the machine-code level. I’ll even venture a falsifiable prediction: that if and when we find a quantum theory of gravity, that theory will include a fundamental (not emergent) distinction between space and time. In other words, no matter what spacetime turns out to look like at the Planck scale, the notion of causal ordering and the relationships “before” and “after” will be there at the lowest level. And it will be this causal ordering, built into the laws of physics, that finally lets us understand why closed timelike curves don’t exist and PSPACE-complete problems are intractable.
I’ll end with a quote from a June 2008 Scientific American article by Jerzy Jurkiewicz, Renate Loll and Jan Ambjorn, about the “causal dynamical triangulations approach” to quantum gravity.
What could the trouble be? In our search for loopholes and loose ends in the Euclidean approach [to quantum gravity], we finally hit on the crucial idea, the one ingredient absolutely necessary to make the stir fry come out right: the universe must encode what physicists call causality. Causality means that empty spacetime has a structure that allows us to distinguish unambiguously between cause and effect. It is an integral part of the classical theories of special and general relativity.
Euclidean quantum gravity does not build in a notion of causality. The term “Euclidean” indicates that space and time are treated equally. The universes that enter the Euclidean superposition have four spatial directions instead of the usual one of time and three of space. Because Euclidean universes have no distinct notion of time, they have no structure to put events into a specific order; people living in these universes would not have the words “cause” or “effect” in their vocabulary. Hawking and others taking this approach have said that “time is imaginary,” in both a mathematical sense and a colloquial one. Their hope was that causality would emerge as a large-scale property from microscopic quantum fluctuations that individually carry no imprint of a causal structure. But the computer simulations dashed that hope.
Instead of disregarding causality when assembling individual universes and hoping for it to reappear through the collective wisdom of the superposition, we decided to incorporate the causal structure at a much earlier stage. The technical term for our method is causal dynamical triangulations. In it, we first assign each simplex an arrow of time pointing from the past to the future. Then we enforce causal gluing rules: two simplices must be glued together to keep their arrows pointing in the same direction. The simplices must share a notion of time, which unfolds steadily in the direction of these arrows and never stands still or runs backward.
By building in a time dimension that behaves differently from the space dimensions, the authors claim to have solved a problem that’s notoriously plagued computer simulations of quantum gravity models: namely, that of recovering a spacetime that “behave[s] on large distances like a four-dimensional, extended object and not like a crumpled ball or polymer”. Are their results another indication that time might not be an illusion after all? Time (hopefully a polynomial amount of it) will tell.",18250,"['cf1eebc9eff6fc7072b73d0a028f14dc1bcff15278374f1b9ba78fc68b4af360', '32f4f601c677deaaaae2b623248ff36e1e8a299dbe4490dec3261f50dfcf7a22', '17f04cccdf8a55995b456b3bd18d92f85340d1aaf193749cc0f4fe0fe483f3ca', 'ccae41d2b75bfb99619d6a7816a77a61289ac259c58aa8c973123f8658ba3e22', '9dfc578371c1c96bd8aa5ec30070baaeb8c238d3c12e4629c540bf1c9b538b5d', '69d67b0853c66da2e0e162627c7e41bd207b0a2a0f21aa093a72e2d1046ab93a', '8784e6685177172873f19fb27ff53490133dd3330f26584ea5ad593464a6a1fc', 'ef0a3ee9e53ef366cf83c644634ce1add8def9f5aa014607702e80cd3f4fbe07', '00effd60d4704c6834ca2335eb2d300c11874556d30bbd0b1dba66e827b92464', '09e956a91bcdfbfea01af0444372c88d8db1f95781c06cada654ceedcb9528ba', '6d6acf920e1f8e0000df648195101be60bae000198855b1e7c1b8396864450e7', 'a826ae31192b52a84e6024a817aa3715a710e719ec56b314cf01d1301ebab495', '4f5eadc0c44db60a841680758cb0e4d287a4b78901108b2bec492cdba830a3d3', '1503eb45f828c8291cbb5d414fafa635a722e0b0e36484d94ec47d08083bf695', '0ad9b22b9ab5efbf1b9601e047b3f1bf4de74f4de40a0411810a6c9e871a760c', 'af52c0c9630d4bf6b745e68b07c13e2dad40d7143e20e748e68e156f7da6b48b', '5b9a3da6e010c9ed528741f9be8e527a590c1da4cba7dda7fb956af9a16452d3', '1e76c69b27628eb1ef17caf186d41257a009609645a3b2c3764eed684e71dc6c', '13ff2b42f257bac13cf03d35d26bba5addca622d56e4a53e8548379e9bc84268', '101d3f77dd0943ae30c6e9551c04c1ceecdc42db4ad6b4dc49abeb36dcbe83e3', '44ac9f18e66becfbe493ce9ee56bbfe624ddd71dab2aca4303c3dd33c58e35e4', '95b9d3d58d61f04557744fc1db434e7f6a820c394c9b2db740fd8647c8338744', '89114eee5e40df06789d696549f50d861e3a520f6c98926ada32c6e56a73a3b8', '5330148466c209e56f12638a441f5e02e83499c9b955703ae09e7c899506f08d', '471d3729a4be8c43cd4fe2ee3637f96c30b12a9030102dcf8bdc4e114331c88b', 'bc80336ff61c2e8c70d2df33dceb3f25a0634a396a395a3d4fc077cc72cd5e37', 'ffab83945aba43136364cbb67ec82b2848119ed1b5bb5a4e3dcd3a2b6aa4a33f', 'f2e7d505c3cbac31ce825e8f7860e65a1bee354fb78441989ad41deb5ad90dd4', '56cc1b180f89362b74eb9f10d515c24cb085465133569544b5e1fe07a536cb84', '5b88ec2c02be046deb3e576b243d217f1d9964317387f3d5078a375feff4cd72', '5729b64fc38e2ea2ab41f07b48836f3871cf65079baedc3467079bde71420aa2', '5490b89d96fb9d772ad69d5dbb8d642cc1c29d99230b102d0900c18a5cf0e89b', 'cdbad7c2f02b1970621e1a3a8907a05c38f872b5d16e2965470f9b24cac89e6f', '64d662cf046c2814a1e10c2c64e84c1562bd7e8483223e6ead947015a8e7b5df', '3e447791ab79112963db1c97dfbdab96d9f8a956c43a0ab8f35f5fbc9976e8ed', '1d371426e50663a41e381f265b8ff7c7854501f5b9c2c1098baf5bbd6e207b8f', 'a6f114879da9b13a515e6ded83c04976c3f6edad507145eb0b5d9ba8d08babb6', 'e1da72eed3b19ef41d221663a2d8b39b386a4db99aaa4cda8edb7f1f4cfd960e', 'c2d69f091c8ce73d5140711f780a35f09150bbcffc7c4156841d5781e389111c', 'b47a82d8d973647fbe2babe3218f48f8225ddc8f20b5f4f363f903b1264e52b4', '614e087377de4b567b250a816b0ef9c53049aae3742f34f89e5156344612a1a9', '529188e8201da62a5e981f1b54cd733252d1ef581c49c5bc986cee95ab6750a7', 'f76788aca7989eda09a27f8f09215666cd2ad89fd227d2c33c5b6ea6eadf63db', '72b9f525dd41cc652e6bcb01d83aa03b631f1e6a7fc505a1043ee09e997892f0', 'dfa2f3e9c015ad9b3f9e29cee73c98e5075dce252dc938c8da0869f149898e63', 'e1551807fe4351fd7f012e807382900c00bbbeaa465cedb7af965cf4300eaddc', '308c8eab019f6b69fd9ab4e46108f8ea23077b0abe531b0af995036f62e81f2d', '4e356e78dbadb36a13a1b3486f30faf2e07934502e281c663256dc263c73c967', '645f1357f9f35937b1ddc4614226ff437ad582c57e90b8bccf8c28c22056f12d', '2e9e725aee49241f59c561b92c4a0300ca746474ae10d49d9174344ec3e289f1', '29a45127bbf4df7232bb95745b144fa91e9cff2ba06cc9d1ff0f8ddee257d784', '5c6b41b9aa29f4261e56d1f55b67615cd7b2399140b4e19f35fd2b13d0250db4', '9af6736934646feffacc7d604509f6ab036165123915982863169a4be2399454', '40b2b00df6036889ddeea2ffdccd62d57eaaf957ba335fabd20b37f169225f2f', 'd20047c8e10b5550a36026f987a4be90ee06ef85d5985ffd6e707b6d0c95c422', 'f1b2c7364195c62ca8fda7a8b20905fce1a854c441b7e5a85dd7691748bef0ca', '1e40dcbdc0a14a482047b9139ceaa13f1504ed5bebf2e2ccef00895645e3464b', 'da05fda24c728f482cae7fca235f618d9ccb60254bce75c3ecac7c5fd7e28200', '3135e11e007ac4d8955b88ef1904495a194397bc8216ae8820476e4f1cd70f25', 'a72eed715ec2815e2d264fc722b8e6598dad447e1b6c7f5579f81ed157d4713d', '83ac0d391e83c1ff6e9fd7a63c15d7c09f08a4bb2adc691ee8600bf82367c33f', 'ac678722d3ddfff21d2847532305a13e78055624af4f6cdef03f42be9199797e', 'a4bc1b2b5f0fe30b73cc3e02c43a822e573a826032fbf4a5ff47e453a0500ce8']"
230,369,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=369,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2008-12-04,Scott Aaronson,Nö nö nö,"At least three people have now asked my opinion of the paper Mathematical Undecidability and Quantum Randomness by Paterek et al., which claims to link quantum mechanics with Gödelian incompleteness. Abstract follows:
We propose a new link between mathematical undecidability and quantum physics. We demonstrate that the states of elementary quantum systems are capable of encoding mathematical axioms and show that quantum measurements are capable of revealing whether a given proposition is decidable or not within the axiomatic system. Whenever a mathematical proposition is undecidable within the axioms encoded in the state, the measurement associated with the proposition gives random outcomes. Our results support the view that quantum randomness is irreducible and a manifestation of mathematical undecidability.
Needless to say, the paper has already been Slashdotted. I was hoping to avoid blogging about it, because I doubt I can do so without jeopardizing my quest for Obamalike equanimity and composure. But similar to what’s happened several times before, I see colleagues who I respect and admire enormously—in this case, several who have done pioneering experiments that tested quantum mechanics in whole new regimes—making statements that can be so easily misinterpreted by a public and a science press hungry to misinterpret, that I find my fingers rushing to type even as my brain struggles in vain to stop them.
Briefly, what is the connection the authors seek to make between mathematical undecidability and quantum randomness? Quantum states are identified with the “axioms” of a formal system, while measurements (technically, projective measurements in the Pauli group) are identified with “propositions.” A proposition is “decidable” from a given set of axioms, if and only if the requisite measurement produces a determinate outcome when applied to the state (in other words, if the state is an eigenstate of the measurement). From the simple fact that no one-qubit state can be an eigenstate of the σx and σz measurements simultaneously (in other words, the Uncertainty Principle), it follows immediately that “no axiom system can decide every proposition.” The authors do some experiments to illustrate these ideas, which (not surprisingly) produce the outcomes predicted by quantum mechanics.
But does this have anything to do with “undecidability” in the mathematical sense, and specifically with Gödel’s Theorem? Well, it’s not an illustration of Gödel’s Theorem to point out that, knowing only that x=5, you can’t deduce the value of an unrelated variable y. Nor is it an illustration of Gödel’s Theorem to point out that, knowing only one bit about the pair of bits (x,y), you can’t deduce x and y simultaneously. These observations have nothing to do with Gödel’s Theorem. Gödel’s Theorem is about statements that are undecidable within some formal system, despite having definite truth-values—since the statements just assert the existence of integers with certain properties, and those properties are stated explicitly. To get this kind of undecidability, Gödel had to use axioms that were strong enough to encode the addition and multiplication of integers, as well as the powerful inference rules of first-order logic. By contrast, the logical deductions in the Paterek et al. paper consist entirely of multiplications of tensor products of Pauli matrices. And the logic of Pauli matrix multiplication (i.e., is this matrix in the subgroup generated by these other matrices or not?) is, as the authors point out, trivially decidable. (The groups in question are all finite, so one can just enumerate their elements—or use Gaussian elimination for greater efficiency.)
For this reason, I fear that Paterek et al.’s use of the phrase “mathematical undecidability” might mislead people. The paper’s central observation can be re-expressed as follows: given an N-qubit stabilizer state |ψ〉, the tensor products of Pauli matrices that stabilize |ψ〉 form a group of order 2N. On the other hand, the total number of tensor products of Pauli matrices is 4N, and hence the remaining 4N-2N tensor products correspond to “undecidable propositions” (meaning that they’re not in |ψ〉’s stabilizer group). These and other facts about stabilizer states were worked out by Gottesman, Knill, and others in the 1990s.
(Incidentally, the paper references results of Chaitin, which do interpret variants of Gödel’s Theorem in terms of axiom systems “not containing enough information” to decide Kolmogorov-random sentences. But Chaitin’s results don’t actually deal with information in the technical sense, but rather with Kolmogorov complexity. Mathematically, the statements Chaitin is talking about have zero information, since they’re all mathematical truths.)
So is there a connection between quantum mechanics and logic? There is—and it was pointed out by Birkhoff and von Neumann in 1936. Recall that Paterek et al. identify propositions with projective measurements, and axioms with states. But in logic, an axiom is just any proposition we assume; otherwise it has the same form as any other proposition. So it seems to me that we ought to identify both propositions and axioms with projective measurements. States that are eigenstates of all the axioms would then correspond to models of those axioms. Also, logical inferences should derive some propositions from other propositions, like so: “any state that is an eigenstate of both X and Y is also an eigenstate of Z.” As it turns out, this is precisely the approach that Birkhoff and von Neumann took; the field they started is called “quantum logic.”",5631,"['500a76b1158d8d0f3e80ca8d33d35e6e16503302135095e4ef75e2a16962c4ab', '3de804023e8261f073970ffe6d75bedab916bbc286b781328c98e6e8de3d5c02', '56d82dca9900c9fd7664d6717e7a15cf9cac74315dd4d2b07e5359ecb9531ada', '5df853581559a553cb1b286ca3b6a7d73d7d7633d17f42a1d98279e0056e3e34', '7c2d1061807c790a357e344377bb9632a39c54e5ae4886cb6e3eb8e141e394a0', '54b396819a4843a0dc0a0cbd26e3a35e858307209f5d081b2d87a9905445cfb4', '29dd50cd2c7fa0ff53920d829f1e2c3f8791d4c4e87722bde63213e786cf0306', 'd849fe3788a04a66b8a610663f106038eaf115b0bf020447c8c74275976b97d3', '95b7115b82bc027a1292af58f563093a7d4176d6903768767b86566292b71d53', '5a45f4d614eeed234c575ceb31af45b9d6e5547715cf2a3d82cadab518c6488c', '84e8e49011579a44c4a805616cb08b1e437a32e093a7e2996327b3ba3ae965df', '21fd0f77ba17a07bcb08bb2b4ad369c269f6fbf430cb6328df6c6a5ba092c079', '4b6ea87ff235f41f1d27661d19496f2588d112984714b84365c70bb8adb7bbe0', '924e35f3de199d4146b975656eacb20539d9bcd1212ce02c68598592190e48ef', 'b34383e330051c76828b8a20fb8b7b1e9c610ae57ad585b8da3dfaac9fa49eb8', '9c54f5278fc717a9bfdef9602fea8f7eba0a61cf2201502b42a3700f07f5a183', '96e67c6af0788ac93460278637aa77f290d15e44c5f9e6987e8934aef74a082c', 'd8f745925821315f390263e6cf80f17714618ead08c4b45d18491c6e77fb5e12', 'be4ef42e42cd7b13dbe87a5f3342d8bada439f5b3655b17b0958eb12f3ef9b7f', '28ac8403f62a198a3741e0d95cf202311df416a164d257a3fc6c3a6404b4cf3c', '238116ba39ba0f254f3c86e466a98d79588520767b0cfc3a6badbc2237c8a505', 'b0894db3316f47c1a2b23d431dd0f2b816b980dc40e35d2e2bd5306fbafc06e1', 'c68f64c51624b7f87d213179a399ac40186fb2c958a45c363fc0fd2425674be4', 'e19d5f469d88f49961f8eb70cd4fa7835d444a5bb7a67a58d59ecd0d545d5590', '73d08eeb256b15ac718c94b91a93ca5f2b1bf9b04cb3d5d93d7977e7b0901421', '53fac28308fd0f46e7bb062e4939ad296dff2ded73f47a5307afd951ec950589', '0656d73ba9dbf410e36f683f23714387b299866ccc3004f901e91ac3ad6c1948', '4f709027bd1cdb9c28299495249303d38ba9df64bc637569874a2ccc6d0766f4', '49144d09bc3da3104f87a26fadea08fbd138b9fe95a96d01cb023f70adef0195', '47241f1ae8ac8bdd82b10994c870f9d0254f34e305e933192e28606b899b931e', '11efdcdb15df2fecdfb6c78db15eb3f91ce527870cb472df9baad0e1a04d3c67', '4864c9c58de3dab25123ebb4f3f46f1ee6d5377dfca6a510664bdd17e1fd84a8', '0f12e43f7964cf7c03831ab15f10453f555631b421e4cdb7d3ab3a2d72b3be2f', 'cb7c0cfed227ee71c10f1af1344e39060cf124c41fcefa83cea95d2ce65baa37', '32012d57a6f04f5b7d6ea77449bc4fa2637d2c0df4b7671b02b4bd83ecb1dca6', 'd0e33a4d011074eb668a3d79febd04ac772f3305e4b0317d4ce1b23c72a9f05a', '93f54a3e3bc010c4ea1fc46a8d3922c66b469397564f5e4f71ac79eb67670251', '9d7ae21e7e7301881b3fb04647efe2d8f6a25767617fe36c3e938a5e5130f2de', '21ee1e0d1ec3131d57ff44608c5e2a1d76c8cc4cb95e6fd43eb647c725623d19', 'c62df01f60ab21c424d130915b915b35075494ac6709b4f53a386c2005ac7598', 'dfc4223d84bb1c80def9e0c54a51112623d83c8b2ce9cf723d34bee2a3bae687', 'f4edfe185a903d451c35844c70e2b420995dd53be794284fcee2da332f3e4cd7', '4166ee5fa7e1a3bbe55a9e8f83e7fac999b69f0e057ea65b7b9f988d54de02d2', '346130895a8927dde53dc4cee12d99259f9294f847f4028bef58ba7555f4e5d2', '61c10dc84f90521436da5bb40cfcd98f38b16148410b52208a2fb5c4fa8d2bd0', 'b9b6f51bed1b6e01b955d1df4e8e498732933e1b400d5997010dc251711cb0b0', '0fdd9f8edf87e4707ed0db14e6b051cbf32b3babd871a0e85cd3ba7f559cfa47', 'e2bc9c5807730bc32a94051cbeb3b2bfb820a1814ec37b08cd2ed96260c7f2d0', 'bb095f60f3400f18b53abcf8f6659765393ae7472364df539d260b023ded685a', '23cf4801c52a74b2695ad2daf173e981b1cf686b9154c86e706c1dc874fd8629', '535f65f022b80797a4d5204004d8465f1e0d69e8c4b9dbe89895d321113e30a2', '2292818908743093639ef1e84ef714c1c59bfa2dc155ed715334c1ede758b6cf', '7da488e321b05431a72c37d3d5a2ab048ba4c634de2de53ac8f7fba88445b99e', 'cf30d9482cabd0a4c344f2b78dd6a6af44ee64f7de9743be071feb031763dc04', 'fec91c4d96c50aced9d3b73aedb5722bb344348e1365a03ab292bc496f4714d7', 'c5d04327a912b6065c44d1c54db66f36015775282bac84d4b917f27035d392ae', '4365f09b744ad3b3abe23fa5b543159ab839582cce7a114a05a085c855063e68', 'b5a3483a2fca26d8664af590a0b5822787205d20fc82b59e771ff84ac34b3945', '89e1b7f65ec60eb685de4b8fdd33692eea8d55c0b4590a6ce5de4628a84fca88']"

This week I explain Valiant’s PAC-learning model (previously covered in GITCS Lectures 19, 20, 21), and also — in response to a question from the floor — take a swipe at Bayesian fundamentalism. When you only know one formalism to describe some phenomenon (in this case, that of choosing hypotheses to fit data), it’s easy to talk yourself into believing that formalism is the Truth: to paraphrase Caliph Omar, “if it agrees with Bayesianism, it is superfluous; if it disagrees, it is heresy.” The antidote is to learn other formalisms. Enter computational learning theory: an account of learning that’s clear, mathematically rigorous, useful, nontrivial, and completely different from the Bayesian account (though of course they have points of contact). The key idea is to jettison the notoriously-troublesome notion of a prior, replacing it by a concept class (about which one makes no probabilistic assumptions), as well as a probability distribution over sample data rather than hypotheses.
Incidentally, I’d say the same thing about complexity theory. If you think (for example) that Turing machines are the only way to reason about computational efficiency, then you’re overdue for a heaping helping of communication complexity, circuit complexity, query complexity, algebraic complexity…
Ah yes, complexity. This week I was at the Conference on Computational Complexity at the beautiful University of Maryland in College Park: home of the Terrapins, as one is reminded by signs placed roughly every three inches. I heard some great talks (ask in the comments section if you want details), gave two talks myself, and during the business meeting, was elected to the CCC Steering Committee. This being a complexity conference, my declared campaign motto was “No We Can’t!” It was inspiring to see how this simple yet hopeful motto united our community: from derandomization to circuit lower bounds, from quantum computing to proof complexity, we might have different backgrounds but we all worry about shrinking grant sizes and the rising costs of conference registration; we all face common challenges to which we want to prove that no solutions exist. Rest assured, I will treat my duties as a steering committee member (mostly helping to select PC chairs, who in turn select the program committees who select the conference papers) with the awesome gravity they deserve.",2393,"['684e580c0e99f365d495bf1c4512a41875663457028c503468f140e31fc5a6a9', '19682a2c81f251ab94891ed4804e81c5cf32f4ef21d6adb9c95200e29c3d1ec2', '45c9855459bb07cd789c1f141a52ab6ce1b51138266e7f604bbe3561ff56f4f6', '4798bd4f2ed724e05d9c59031125c1c6332e95310fd6f48aa13077a7dac8adab', 'b827de2acb5079cd627fd6ec377124e450a5415f52322004ac6566b22460b1d6', 'c171150ac138e52ad1e2056a43db64a1e41e7aa1eae9acf2654fe59258283e0f', 'fcced515eb5fea71465dcabec3234873abf1a12b5a4ab97bfa85f810bbe77408', '73151a450bc2d41804461f169e8cdf7f7ce2b707f2923833112bf0d0610738f7', '8e4e9cc5c58ce364feace50d93b313b1d9f15102ba9021aba621e4189569ab02', 'f76fcb8f158f818cbf36e5fc5ee245855238103f1841fb2831afc0d4293528e9', '3c5a545bdb1baab095e331ba3e5d373f6fe5f010003128feeedfa1977fbbc99e', 'ef49d5b6e4f3b5a99d3e68cccb2c095745374d06a4be49e5059a11b26afa5903', 'c47f3c66625db8949efb0b290277d8b83781eb6a30767b1d700d7bb5d9d3e6cb', 'fb1523857ea29468fb6040f019a55674d1f600f5ce06a4f92daaff31f4a25d9d', 'aef7a70ef4762fa8728aecce8ef9813246f60cc2c775862d6f52d384b88da264', 'c14e33b86740b8fef410e59b42002252898689794600126698b0b1beeec03b59', '22512e3a395d0bd5bfd0e0e76aaa9e82ae3d9d0aef92070611dacdbe3dd47cc7', 'fad6fa1987a62a3e6ec8242d5fee404fa199a76634cf07002ba5ac90661fff6e', 'c851b317ae457e49467e733b8de5c7ab38417875768c2814e7c7ebe489ca8a72', '2b65c1683a159dd31c9cee2e26925994c0e5ae2eca1b37ad090ac398bf1b076b', 'c73fc49c81433f167b3390aff55a902e458925c03572950fb11d626e50818c01', '0f72051e26bc4bc3cace6de532bad93f17eee7113a4d3126e673234c7c70cbf4', 'c0d5ce71f436b75bba5f5a8c98c23169c40ce96781284462fc43028a30e09048', 'd8a917e415c738c96f5a1482ab54b2fc562e54e6aa429f5eaaf4a6de2edce0c0', '7d73c6269e9e87d6b3f7ec97e206189d7f35a6ef01b4c57a497db94c78f70525', 'bfe8bf3d8ae288aa09b638e3b57fc2509a448faa15282bc8d4cce41e911fc53e', '45fc74524cedc97dfc6e90fdfb6331726e26ee84ebfdb35235120364715a8ec4', '3fd8cccd871000ecf41e7dd45f7cf73220ceef9e386adc2f896938d0c98f6ee3', '4cd9c5c5014eeee310527ffadad9a1d6051b93f42052711926a63e24679223e7', 'f576741dd2ce89bd04e0db6a1af091975a4bd2cbbcbf075048351a5258489560', 'dd302eb577208311699c84124453ad0494f050c595919965f05cc6b4a10469c9', 'f135f509960a02f78e18b54ca91deee64a61784029cac8e80fd1a59a1ef58d74', 'b351d494587bca65bfe23aeb257c49c1cce134fb4dcb872c4041ed18daeccf5e', '39ac45e6f09d259992d1ad4eb65371955c009b5b0f36fec87562d6051d500d56', 'bdd6736b02b1fd9c1af278232a6029347f62b3bba651f5496e0997a38dbb3d12', '39e37e27b6b5a9733971f9173fef243ea8ee07abba761d8a163e896f75ff0ebf', '8ba41bfda459be15676b7e8f39c2f895d0214ef39ab1a13875c5f03f92ffd24c', '11567724c91dc47749c5c07896c894088ffcf1c5b8e1a0a26efdbbe3bbd83e0a', 'd59b35dec994e4ed395f310e3bbead60c8c5d3c94f1d84865322a15ca37db165', '4c1788742caa4c9660610c50585f1b002a62556a0dc57a6834f5e3d388b19952', 'd46153e09801e92a9677b934eb642a16de0b5f7895f2be3fb9c4caf747e0d17a', 'd1d3952395c6a7e18ceff93a240d3d70f09bb9137a40961fc012e7a7c3461f96', '3a3dc3def2fddfa8f49216ca4e24b92542ec3dbf16f5aa09fd4b17d7a156e0c2', '978cfbdaecc17c4b1a7128a8ca9caf24b4be1f8db7aee08015d2973b76908dbc', '384b4fde3148378cc61cbb8c29acb138724ce98101b1f06b8cbd7d2a4a76b30d', 'e40d3618699c25cc9d477be11184a8500e2d6708ac3413e6ec1114bae9e48e16', '3f22e8c1a55efd9891ce7d47f6d174cb4e560c4b8be1f3703b3b2481527e266f', 'fd9c8f0424c37da488ce23cd59fd3c025c7edcc605748b27f597445e9be63b07', '1817ac08f2085107215c0f76cc0a333a7ac25b43a095d30238dd60e72a46a54d', '695c54ee3af827ee0dec828c40927d27081b3c04b77e28555161c043099bb33e', '4db99c651829f1b726075ae626edc53e3ff3958c2c7d1bde57fb56db9ac50a6b', 'b70cc983542f3a69563718d69f7cf59d165dbe7ce419992de08bf6867651b9fb', 'afbce2fb7f30484c348e203e4151335a9624374ef1b36a96bcb714199288bf24', '51708ed017c213c3453c234bb9d9a8cd26b7afb0cc28e09783ce8b79fa8a258a', '624f2f610031badf27e54835799c7c787e892cfe7648a2f396179f83109b93ab', '9302c3324ca6fab1efb02836e9709fb655831f08671d3be6e974307a060e04a1', '4a415d31f3baab04672dc2c999c2d04e20cd752cc4cd0eaf5f1c684b4e7a6481', '4908d7208f351eb712a83f0d56ca0fa49f975dd01b0886cb43e5416a12061e8d', 'd849dc568ca37db63bbd31b77d1f7be619cfa6b8d71864791411ba4b9bf598af', '6d64cc6e15ecdea85feb73efeeba937785c74214b04405ed0df1880b9a8f3763', '03c6ef5e03047076a79792180a13f1f0fbfbd1f5bdddddc5da705bffce0d50e5', '9e3e716ebd9c33efe1692aa31d14c692341ad86b3dcbe44f9ba74ffbcfb9493f', '6b506bb07d4d194b3d307e5dd53eb1a08db818684a09a4341cde20f081476b6d', '4af8fe28a781fcce58351c77502fe2da3642c4b6122c6a8d703911bffc4d0102']"

I knew the lab was big; what I hadn’t quite appreciated before getting there is that it’s an entire town, with its own police department, restaurants, etc. In many ways it looks like lots of small towns across America, except that this one’s primary business is smashing gold ions into each other at relativistic speeds and measuring properties of the resulting quark-gluon plasmas.
When I talk to physicists like the ones at BNL, they often find it faintly ridiculous that anyone would doubt quantum mechanics. But people certainly do — even when they don’t admit that that’s what they’re doing — when the alternative is accepting that integers are efficiently factorizable in the physical world. Which brings us to QCSD Lecture 14, on eleven skeptical objections to quantum computing and what can be said in response to them. And yeah, if you’ve been reading this blog for years, a lot of the material won’t be new to you. It’s just one more hunk of meat to throw into the tigers’ den.",1181,"['4b052ff7b31edf3a605454d4f86dd25bea3427662199479f5b937719f208a320',

236,309,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=309,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2008-02-17,Scott Aaronson,Scientific American article is out!,"After three years of procrastination and delays, my 8-page feature article on “The Limits of Quantum Computers” has finally appeared in the March issue of Scientific American. Once I get permission, I’ll post a plain-text version on my website. In the meantime, you can buy the online issue for US$5.00 from SciAm‘s website, in which case you get colorful sidebars and graphics (including a bearded, white-lab-coated cartoon scientist holding quantum computers and complexity class inclusion diagrams), as well as an interview with Jeff Kimble about the unfortunate movie “Jumper”, and other articles about “the end of cosmology”, prediction markets (Robin Hanson and his “futarchy” get a mention), and the disastrous overfishing of the bluefin tuna (the kind used for toro sushi).
Update (2/18): By popular demand, I’m posting a rough early draft (PDF) of my article online. Read at your own risk!
So, what was it like to write for Scientific American? Exhausting, excruciating, and ultimately worth it. As a general rule, SciAm (probably like all large-circulation magazines) rewrites articles so extensively that the person listed in the byline is less the “writer” than the “content consultant.” Almost every sentence in my article bears the scars of battle (some that I won, more that I didn’t). Yet I have to concede that, when something was really cringe-inducingly wrong, SciAm was willing to listen and make changes — and besides, they did a great job with the cartoons. I’m happy with the end result. Thanks to George Musser, the editor who solicited the article and gave me lots of feedback in the early stages, and to Graham Collins, who finally saw it into print.
A few specific comments for your amusement:
- In an earlier draft, the cartoons adorning my article were “all balding white guy, all the time” (supposedly, because of the need to keep a “consistent character” throughout the article). I demanded some sort of cartoon-diversity. After a heated discussion among the editors — in which, I’m told, the name of Larry Summers was invoked — they finally agreed to add a cartoon black woman. To those who think I’m a male chauvinist pig: how many brownie points do I get?
- No, the crystal ball with floating ψ’s and φ’s, mounted atop a keyboard, is not an accurate depiction of what a quantum computer would look like. Having toured some actual QC labs, though, I had to admit it worked better graphically than a lab table piled high with tinfoil, lasers, and assorted pipes.
- The topic label of the article is “Information Technology.” I pleaded with them to change the topic to “Computer Science,” but to no avail. Apparently the problem was that in the table of contents, the previous two articles were labeled “Prediction Science” and “Brain Science.”
- The complexity class inclusion diagram on page 67 was a key concession I did win. (Apparently some editors felt a Venn diagram with P, NP, BQP, and PSPACE would be way too complicated, even for readers who regularly gobble down heaping helpings of M-theory.) As you can imagine, exposing people to this stuff seemed pretty important to me: this is apparently the first time P, NP, and NP-completeness have been explained at any length in Scientific American since articles by Knuth and by Lewis and Papadimitriou in the 1970’s.
- In the author bio on page 67, the description of me as a “high school dropout” is a slight exaggeration, but there’s no other short term for what I am (see here for more).
- I had nothing to do with the sidebar on page 68, about Vernor Vinge’s novel A Fire Upon the Deep. I’ve never read that (or anything else by Vinge for that matter).
- My original draft included explanations of both the polynomial and adversary methods for quantum lower bounds, with references to BBCMdW and Ambainis. Shockingly, all of that was cut, while the part about time machines was greatly expanded.
During the hairiest parts of editing process, I was reminded of a passage in Anita and Solomon Feferman’s biography of the great logician Alfred Tarski, which described Tarski’s writing of an article for Scientific American (the only popular article he ever wrote).
Usually the Scientific American articles are heavily edited; many are rewriteen and some even ghostwritten, but Wisnovsky [Tarski’s editor] knew better than to tamper with Tarski’s work and did not — except for his usage of ‘which’ and ‘that’. It seemed to him that Tarski did a 180-degree reversal of these words, so he changed every ‘which’ to ‘that’ and every ‘that’ to ‘which’ and sent the proofs to Tarski, who changed everything back to the way it had been. Wisnovsky got out Fowler’s Dictionary of Modern English Usage, the house bible, and called Tarski on the telephone. “I asked if I could read him the relevant passage on ‘that’ and ‘which’ and he said, ‘yes’. It goes on for pages, but he listened very patiently until I finished. Then he said, ‘Well, you see, that is Fowler. I am Tarski.’ The minute he said that I caved in. I felt cut off at the knees and I gave up trying to make any changes at all.”
Yet, while the “Tarski approach” to magazine writing is a tempting one, here’s the final irony. I looked up Tarski’s actual article from 1969, and it badly needed an editor.",5245,"['cbe93ba92030661f4d306ce6be3ddfde39438c136219947a862e108d00ffe778',

Read about proofs that don’t impart any knowledge beyond their own validity, proofs you can check by examining a few random symbols, and (for those who already know that stuff) proofs that certain interpretations of quantum mechanics would predict you can see over the course of your life, yet can’t hold in your mind at any individual time.

238,306,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=306,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2008-01-29,Scott Aaronson,Geordie Rose at MIT,"While there are many, many things in this world that I’m bent on destroying, D-Wave Systems has never been one of them. Ideally, I’d simply let the D-Wave folks do their thing (namely, try to build an adiabatic quantum computer) while I do my thing (namely, study the fundamental limits of quantum computers). It was only when, in connection with D-Wave, cringe-worthy claims about quantum computing started appearing all over the press that I felt a professional obligation to say something.
Now that I’m “involved,” though, I also need to keep you ablog of any notable further developments. And presumably, D-Wave founder Geordie Rose coming to MIT to meet with our quantum information group counts as notable.
Two months ago, you’ll recall, we were graced by a visit from D-Wave’s Mohammad Amin and Andrew Berkley, but I’d never before had the pleasure of meeting Geordie. At least formally, the reason for his visit was not to defend D-Wave, but to present “four hard problems” for us to solve. These problems were as follows:
- Find a practical adiabatic factoring algorithm. Because of the equivalence of adiabatic and standard quantum computing, we know that such an algorithm exists, but the running time you get from applying the reduction is something like O(n11). Geordie asks for an O(n3) factoring algorithm in the adiabatic model. It was generally agreed (with one dissent, from Geordie) that reducing factoring to a 3SAT instance, and then throwing a generic adiabatic optimization algorithm at the result, would be a really, really bad approach to this problem.
- Find a fault-tolerance threshold for adiabatic quantum computing, similar to the known threshold in the circuit model. Geordie asserted that such a threshold has to exist, because of the equivalence of adiabatic and standard quantum computing. However, others immediately pointed out that this is not so: the equivalence theorem is not known to be “fault-tolerance-preserving.” This is a major open problem that many people have worked on without success.
- Prove upper and lower bounds on the adiabatic algorithm’s performance in finding exact solutions to hard optimization problems.
- Prove upper and lower bounds on its performance in finding approximate solutions to such problems. (Ed Farhi described 3 and 4 as “so much harder than anything else we’ve failed to solve.”)
While none of these problems are new to the quantum computing community, they’re all extremely good ones, and all (indeed) extremely hard.
Of course, we did also discuss some controversial, red-meat, “did-D-Wave-build-a-quantum-computer” sorts of questions, so I owe it to you to provide a few highlights from that discussion.
Seth Lloyd, who’s been more sympathetic to D-Wave than most of us, correctly pointed out that D-Wave has a “credibility problem in the scientific community.” He discussed in great detail the experiments D-Wave ought to be doing to convince scientists that they’re really seeing quantum effects. I strongly agreed with Seth, adding that I’d rather see two coherent qubits than thousands of incoherent ones. Of course, even if D-Wave could demonstrate two-qubit entanglement (and Geordie says it’s the “next thing on the list”), there would still remain the enormous issues of scalability and of the limitations of the adiabatic algorithm in solving hard optimization problems. But at least we could be more comfortable in saying that what they currently have is a tiny quantum computer.
Geordie conceded that, so far, D-Wave has no direct evidence for entanglement among two or more qubits. He nevertheless argued that they have indirect evidence (basically, that their data are better fit by a simple quantum model than a simple classical one), and that the lack of direct evidence is solely due to the difficulty of performing the requisite measurements. Seth replied that, despite the difficulty, D-Wave would “do itself a big favor” by performing the measurements.
Seth also mentioned D-Wave’s claims to the popular press — for example, about the ability of quantum computers to solve NP-complete problems — as a major factor in its scientific credibility problem. Geordie admitted that some of D-Wave’s publicity was (here he paused for a few seconds) “not inaccurate, but verging on inaccurate.”
Note: Geordie now says that he was only talking about the reporting on D-Wave; in his words, “I stand by 100% anything I’ve ever said to anyone about these machines.” At the time, I understood him quite clearly to be talking about D-Wave’s own publicity; it’s strange that he would have hesitated to admit that reporters have misunderstood things. But I freely admit that I might have misheard or misinterpreted him.
I asked Geordie about the result of Bansal, Bravyi, and Terhal that the planar Ising spin graph problem admits an efficient classical approximation algorithm — thus calling into question D-Wave’s whole strategy of solving other NP approximation problems by mapping them onto Ising spin graph instances. Geordie replied, first, that their machine can handle many non-planar links, and second, that Bansal et al.’s algorithm merely trades an exponential dependence on n for an exponential dependence on 1/ε. I agreed that their algorithm isn’t practical, but argued that its mere existence would have to be dealt with in any attempt to convert approximate solutions of the Ising spin graph problem into approximate solutions of the original optimization problems.
So, where do we stand? Here’s my attempt at a fair summary:
- The people at D-Wave are not conscious frauds; they genuinely believe in what they’re doing.
- On the other hand, much of the publicity surrounding D-Wave can be safely rejected. To some academics, even one or two public misrepresentations are enough to destroy a company’s credibility. Others, however, prefer to ignore press releases — seeing hype, exaggeration, and even outright falsehoods as just a necessary part of raising money — and to concentrate solely on a company’s communications with experts. Where you fall between these extremes probably depends on your personality more than anything else.
- In the past, I criticized D-Wave (rightly, I think) for failing to share information with the scientific community in a good-faith manner. To their credit, they’re now making more of an effort to communicate.
- Thus far, by Geordie’s own account, there’s no direct evidence that D-Wave’s machine actually produces entanglement at any stage of its operation (which all agree is a non-negotiable requirement for quantum computing). Geordie says that producing such evidence will be the “next thing on the list.” The Sudoku stunt was worthless from a scientific perspective; it did not answer any of the questions that physicists need answered.
- Even if D-Wave managed to build (say) a coherent 1,024-qubit machine satisfying all of its design specs, it’s not obvious it would outperform a classical computer on any problem of practical interest. This is true both because of the inherent limitations of the adiabatic algorithm, and because of specific concerns about the Ising spin graph problem. On the other hand, it’s also not obvious that such a machine wouldn’t outperform a classical computer on some practical problems. The experiment would be an interesting one! Of course, this uncertainty — combined with the more immediate uncertainties about whether D-Wave can build such a machine at all, and indeed, about whether they can even produce two-qubit entanglement — also means that any talk of “lining up customers” is comically premature.",7584,"['0516ad4f7c4cfdd26df257ef45abed7d3183e94ace98cb0e30ef3cf5a9677c21',

239,297,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=297,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2007-12-13,Scott Aaronson,"Australian educators are using my $5,000 plagiarism settlement to sell schoolkids (on science)","Two months ago, you might remember, the gods of humor and blogging saw fit to bestow on me an unexpected gift:
Model 1: But if quantum mechanics isn’t physics in the usual sense — if it’s not about matter, or energy, or waves — then what is it about?
Model 2: Well, from my perspective, it’s about information, probabilities, and observables, and how they relate to each other.
Model 1: That’s interesting!
“For almost the first time in my life,” I wrote then, “I’m at a loss for words … Help me, readers. Should I be flattered? Should I be calling a lawyer?”
Almost three hundred comments later, your answer was clear. Half of you thought I’d be a stereotypical American jerk, epitomizing everything wrong with modern society, if I sought any redress for the blatant plagiarism of my quantum mechanics lecture. The other half thought I’d be a naïve moron if I didn’t seek redress. However, there did seem to be a rough consensus on two topics: first, that as part of any settlement I should “date the models” (at least a hundred people made some joke to that effect, each one undoubtedly thinking it highly creative); and second, that it was probably okay to try to get something from either Ricoh (the printer company) or Love Communications (the ad agency), as long as the proceeds went to charity and I didn’t directly benefit. Since, like any public figure, I now make all decisions by polling my base, I finally had a warrant for action.
After talking things over informally with Warren Smith — the guy who discovered the Ricoh ad in the first place, who just happens (in one of the many ironies of this case) to be studying Australian intellectual property law, and to whom I’m deeply indebted — I next contacted a lawyer from a well-known Australian law firm. Talking to her confirmed my suspicion that many of the armchair legal theories offered in my comments section were simply mistaken. In Australian copyright law, as in American law, you can’t just take someone’s words and use them for commercial purposes without permission or attribution, regardless of any subjective judgments about the “uniqueness” or “specialness” of those words. I was on strong legal ground. But there was also a key difference between the Australian and American legal systems: Australian lawyers are prohibited from taking cases on a contingency basis. If I wanted the law firm to pursue the case, then I would have to pay them up-front.
Disregarding the pleas of my relatives — who at this point were begging me to sue — I instead wrote to Love Communications directly, proposing a settlement to be donated (for example) to a mutually-agreed-upon Australian science outreach organization. We eventually agreed to a settlement of AUS$5,000. Considering the value of Love Communications’ Ricoh account — which the Sydney Morning Herald reported as more than AUS$1,000,000 — I thought the ad agency was getting off incredibly easily, but at least I wouldn’t have to write any more letters or deal with lawyers.
The one remaining problem was to find a suitable Australian science outreach organization to which to donate the $5,000, and that would also be amusing to blog about. As I chewed on this problem, my mind wandered back to my visit to Brisbane in December 2005, and to a conversation I’d had there with Jennifer Dodd — then of the University of Queensland and now of the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo. In that conversation, Jen had told me about a popular-science lecture series in Brisbane she’d founded, called BrisScience. I’d immediately asked her to repeat the name.
“BrisScience,” she said.
“Spell it?” I asked.
“B-r-i-s-Science. Why, is there something funny about the name?”
“No, no, it shouldn’t be a big deal in Australia.”
Aha! I now emailed Jen to ask whether BrisScience had continued its “cutting-edge” outreach programs in her absence. Jen replied that yes, it had, and she put me in touch with Joel Gilmore, BrisScience’s current director. Joel told me that not only was BrisScience still going strong (with the next lecture, by Bill Phillips, being about quantum mechanics), but that he (Joel) also directed another science outreach program called the Physics Demo Troupe, which does hands-on science shows for schoolkids in Brisbane and rural areas. Joel proposed that we donate $2,000 of the settlement to BrisScience and $3,000 to the Physics Demo Troupe, the latter supporting a visit to the Torres Strait Islands in North Queensland. I agreed, and Love Communications agreed as well.
I am, of course, gratified that this sordid southern-hemisphere tale of sex, plagiarism, quantum mechanics, and printers could be resolved to everyone’s satisfaction, without the need for a courtroom battle, and that schoolkids in Torres Strait Island might even learn some physics as a result. But is there one sentence with which to conclude this saga, one sublimely fatuous thought that sums up my feelings toward the entire affair? Wait for it… wait for it…
That’s interesting.",4988,"['81d97b3d9a300eb4545405d9561652d13c0d5e14fcd982887e6b41de860fab9f', '0837f93387084a4e9e0ae1db3bb62349652e92cd63490e012d4e622266fcef4d',

Since I aim to please, I finally cracked open my review copy on a train this weekend, and am pleased to report that … yes, it’s quite good. Indeed, the biggest problem is just Mermin’s infamous insistence on spelling qubit “Qbit.” (At this point, one might as well decide to spell quark “Qork.” A language consists of shared, often highly-irrational conventions that cannot be changed unilaterally.)
Mermin’s book is, one might say, radically limited in scope. There’s nothing about physical implementation, not a mixed state or POVM in sight, not a word on the provable limitations of quantum computers, no mention of P, NP, or BQP, and pretty much nothing about any development after 1995. The sole aim is to cover the “quantum canon” — Hadamards and Toffolis, Shor and Grover, quantum error-correction, the BB84 key distribution protocol, etc. — while dispelling various misconceptions along the way. But at that limited task, Mermin — who’s an extremely gifted expositor — does a better job than almost anyone.
He certainly does a better job than I would have. I’ll admit that, when the Mike&Ike book came out seven years ago, I naïvely imagined that the “quantum textbook problem” (or more precisely, the good quantum textbook problem) had been solved. From now on, there would be a single place where everyone could go to learn the quantum canon. And because anyone could know all that twentieth-century material by reading a single book, I could readily assume that anyone who was interested did know it, and could take that as shared background knowledge (like, say, the existence of the Roman Empire) when discussing newer topics like quantum lower bounds, the adiabatic algorithm, or BQP/qpoly.
Of course I couldn’t have been more wrong. In the years since Mike&Ike came out, the total amount of confusion in the world about the |A〉|B〉|C〉’s of quantum computing (as well as the total number of books that try to address that confusion) has increased exponentially. And so it’s good to have a distinguished physicist like Mermin patiently telling readers the following:
“To understand how to build a quantum computer … you must indeed have many years of experience in quantum mechanics and its applications under your belt. But if you only want to know what such a device is capable in principle of doing once you have it, then there is no reason to get involved in the really difficult physics of the subject.” (page xiii)
“This means that all traces of the amplitudes αx characterizing the input state have vanished from the output state. The only role they have played in the measurement is to determine the probability of a particular output.” (page 25)
“Small alterations in the phases produce small alterations in the probabilities of getting that extremely precise digital information, but not the precision of the information itself, once it is acquired.” (page 85)
Personally, I find it hard to remember that anyone needs to be told these things — and even when I do tell them, they don’t believe me (probably because I’m waving my arms too wildly). They think I’m making it up. But Mermin dispels the common misconceptions with a calm air of gravity.
I’ll end with two quibbles.
First, while Mermin talks a great deal about quantum black-box algorithms, he never once mentions the crucial distinction between the “black-box” world — the world where one can prove unconditionally both that quantum computers can solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers, and that they can’t solve certain other problems any faster than classical ones — and the “non-black-box” world, where all such statements are necessarily conjectural. The one time he does touch on this distinction, he gets it wrong:
“The best known classical algorithms for finding the period r of such a function take a time that grows faster than any power of the number n of bits of r (exponentially with n1/3).” (page 63)
The best classical algorithm for period-finding provably takes time that grows exponentially with n/2. The best known classical algorithms for factoring take time that grows exponentially with n1/3. But the latter algorithms (necessarily) use deeper properties of the factoring problem than just its reducibility to period-finding.
I found this an uncharacteristic omission for Mermin — whose tendency is to examine whatever he brings up from all possible angles — though perhaps it can be understood in terms of a decision to avoid any mention of complexity theory.
The second quibble is that there are no exercises.",4734,"['bde1199011df94087fad4fe0c44812f3a697bedd193b8c5c4cc79082471e092a', 'd679cef34f7220a052b5ecb339fc3879c7a0d19076348c52a978a134538b6157', '1cd6f1268a7b932b30ff6cd9d3ca06d1c716a384f22544876e0e2f96eeacd982', '69c73ba475184eae35a71cc9d6d2780235068b0c7c259a67f61e2220a7c09fcf', '1abf3d87b4e6fdb95cd3827b4c6adbbd69fcb08dc37ca7eec6b8be9d8204be99', '0eaef0f9cef36af889866c79336aa52ef8665ae75e9d63ab46fb301348ccd8ba', '1801fe6ec2b777f45411d346bac12428243df81aeee29baf1a760c857d8bfb98', 'dcd36781f0e2eff3d18df9eaf09cf654b6b657b3bd57ad720732de32e01e769e', '6aa2ccf587822c64d78337dcc144f6c0565ffd72753cfdb9ec25d88fc266a8e9', 'c7fea69a383fa8581ffd5d6edc5381e2254168f468829c7b460c6f9a31bf27bb', '452e2a992c4fd22d59987df995208cbe0250207709dc47ce74880aa31c216294', 'c9b00102116780e9e978cd7db0f09a8fe5f1a13fda35a5e86170413c55410207', '4fe81660cf593753bd712f2d419c115795d80940476daf77974b66d52f278765', '93e7a97ee033343fff1083a4cadea254873a7437bfaeaeff4347699a7789a090', '8951bfde382d526ac8cbe1631260c175fd23f4b6d470365e02a9fc1fe7d84e87', 'dafacdc24aab1d54ab5aaeea79086043027b88ab994dc1b8fcce43619e6b8cfd', 'dcfa08f882a4c85d6bb1b3f8b137f2e1794c616813c7fb67090cc314a99bff41', '7cbf085216472ddd6ec14d91c30a5ce7bfa3708200ac80408477f3e5362f2e53']"

I’m really no happier because of knowing that a phenomenon called quantum entanglement exist [sic]. Now, you say, this phenomenon has the potential to enable super-powerful computing, teleportation, … I say, until science helps me with a comprehensive, provable, repeatable methodology for using it’s [sic] results to make me (and everyone who wants to be) happy, I really do not see it as significantly more helpful than faith.
NB: Any chance that a unification theory could help the poor stave off devastating climate change caused in part by the profligacy of the west? End the brutality of war? Stop child sexual exploitation? Remove corruption, greed, racism, …
This is not a rhetorical question
A few quick non-rhetorical answers:
- At the least, thinking about quantum entanglement doesn’t exacerbate problems like war and climate change (if we neglect o(1) terms like the jet fuel needed to fly to conferences). The same can’t be said for many other human endeavors.
- The scientific revolution 400 years ago led directly to a doubling of the human lifespan, the birth of democracy and its subsequent spread across the world (Galileo, Newton → Spinoza, Hume, Locke → Paine, Jefferson → …), and the cessation of practices such as witch-burning. It’s true that those few lucky enough to have been tribal chieftains with large harems probably wouldn’t want to trade places with a modern; and also true that Hitler and Stalin managed to surpass the already-impressive brutality of the ancients. But on the whole, it seems to me that the human condition improved once we started understanding how the universe works. And given the number of utopian ideas that managed to do nothing but drench this vale of tears in new tears of their own, I don’t see the relative success of curiosity-driven science as anything to sneeze at.
- I do try to do my tiny part to raise awareness of climate change and other threats to civilization. Of course, every time I do so, I’m attacked in the comments section by hordes of denialists who tell me I should stick to what I know about (like quantum entanglement). There’s just no pleasing everyone.
- I see the central problem facing humanity — much more central than climate change, greed, racism, or anything else you mentioned — as collective stupidity. If we, as a species, weren’t so collectively stupid, we’d have error-correcting mechanisms that checked the other problems before they spiraled out of control.I also maintain the possibly-naïve hope that, if people could just understand basic conceptual points about how the world works — like why quantum entanglement doesn’t allow faster-than-light communication, but is still not the same as classical correlation — some tiny contribution might be made to fighting the collective stupidity of our species and thereby helping to ensure its continued survival. That, and not the prospect of teleportation or super-powerful computing, is what really motivates me.",3027,"['d311c9c0ffac633d980f0bf0321647a9a68ab70ce98fba13e72a5464eeb4a6e1', '31d47cad09368fb75b7ad1d92c7e4bc158060f4d0d5e8300af5294e3a10f3f18', '2ffc39571bddc21aa9926cafe11a1ced956e05215c92f6ea6edfc989711adb1c', '416eebcdd15c91aabda78bd00fb393e816dfbbbfc8c396b81dc536106ad5473c', '59866648907a6208cf7959205e0babc8a4bdc63273586096e05e40ddeb61a200', '2a5a569b49f166a02e85e04e126c8fe6ab14beff3a9eaf073ecd776a0c84f995', 'dfb3c1b113c37e9f46a7b2368d34053679971d36757244260f0f87429d9469c1', '744b0fbc0f8f5992038cd6e17f2ba5ae747a3e55aec419bbc4a1c0f8a5aab390', '6acf6ecdb885b1dfda975c4fdeef990c69ecb146a51e02731162519e1e5959fd', '03fc15102af48a8395f09b622c11640fc2fd8539858799e5b74dccbc1dbb7aa7', 'd4aa6e698638b7c2521e446e260ed622c6f555fc3b2d1601be9cef0dccbac15c', '90daa98907b9a759b50e081f8f33aba9e85da71f0529885c2afa91e026be5405', '159292135bd9c73a3fffefc7a01d80f3f2aabdf76de84d82b31b1e64e50436ec', 'b2e54b10b45383810b16628ecd1c62859b08e02a95ac06ca18b48c7190a000a1', '8f66c5ffded8f1b0f4f8a4b49692fa0f2a759f182967fd5715d75a35f4dc6ab1', '6ca5935908d2d250f3e8c4c200a4573686a5ccfe6af00cbf89ae4b4be67be3c3', '9747e636db61a92ae6fb66470860f8886a73d79a32c5594daa7b2c50f1bb7107', '812c0977bdf791c8edbf337aae4fe1698dded897bb98a5c29b238920f68cef07', '8c91abd6cba620214747babe48fdee80c06a3bb5bc56f12e2c3368447a04c638', 'c9e1019e80e66eb37b195abb3bf55fab12565b10de53e48b5efb7c8eb8b9103c', '4abef2b4b6fa9711c26be992ae54f92d6c8a7a2debef1b0e4543b264beccb597', 'db07a4f520bbbbc2c7693d114cebaa05d14e8402d21a82276f3eb2e68c9a6bba', '9a0f8498418b1df128dea995eec1359aead0e9ae3f7b3e0b982c08c49ebc7a8e', '697fda4d37878703223db7c17bb720ef9c04a5b4f7d01f4c3f14ed4d44f9218a', '87fe94aae3a367501057a92c35b4244b583d87d644d377aa7415de4c70672fc9', '067bd2811450dfd06913555f094d37a589126e633cdf90629ca549906f66569f', '279a32d5fa229b09f1a1e41c8171204064090191ad3acd064a199cfbc8507fc1', 'f30ab0b216ad5c0fd4fe9a25ea856282d897b6c89db36683214be305e3ab2353', '5fe1e542f68ad92932a7b35562674abea52f531eb17421b473f4f80c12b77c2e', '1fa81115cf2ac376f56d8989fd53e48b382aca9447c764570b175abc2673adfe', '7679c2049fa5d283fd7838b683394dba8300739379f7c2963e9c2e08f679ca99', '97fe08d522305b1c12a6fd9c511320b89079d94c31fe887b8041011dfb49d4df', 'c5a9d4b0404eff8fd71aed64ec8cf16838641510b7752a75ed228966ee1ce5a6', 'e40523dd90dc67392936c75a0df97bc66625ac7fdb5286d3d67c23b86ae9b941', 'edd20bd262f62aabde631195ee672fd99f716437e7ead2282f791e1deba0aabf', 'b6414922b00565c521fcb58d6a5b3c4d70a4c8f405828a6d0dd8c012f2b2ab36', '436fc9af32e77a8a58de3bf072da2af97f913c84e6404b1dc70b8c7cfed949e3', 'fa97de0eac9623f2b4107273153a1ec10f260c7114be8ea21b80d4c7f5c02c1c', '78c9635232cd01257cac99f2aaa44caac650e76ed44014e66a56ec3a3a0519c9', 'dc4353ce1c06475a98ef8a5fac55f1e78e68d99f918b1cbbd1372f59b71afad1', 'ef8b8812b541903227fbde5ad603072810eaa82c3f56d9b0ee355602dbb49d33', 'c337042b84e9c89c8336d001006170bbe33dc72417c585090e0596e1c3d40e56', '56795f73cb7a831659d98f817157134d64c90ef30d753d608db2db9866ec7b91', '5fff9ab68fdd6a02b150c84e66254248a53c623ab152284ee866ae302efc62da', 'e694ba709806e9303d4f3bb33995a098ed3e63c2c177ae68b0f5df9ceafeb61f', '912ba5036bfa8e9891f8a71a3678a33c71fa29ff3bb547f2b07cb0a6b602e81c', 'e23864667a368f4d41153cdb4e630da48cedd3a03ce1141435d03e07a6947686', '5602d63558ba8f98db244c223eebb408d84343e73d0e83f201acc02932b02d08', '16eaf4742cbd67d199490fbb61e6c2814eff09c462f8f8f0eca60c2ac8da51c9', '24c4ff4ebb03cf1c779a3ac35763e0b5175353c2e9d12406148259de00d79e3e', '956262a1fa8c7b8a728fe1ff32e5faad1e0c279d88d88fbc6b77391d82eed1b1', '3a314945ce1e910e976966162ce3c0f472cf261ebd495f7df818035a0a261001', '712de1e853a4115de4b1e4149d584480646691b4c735c282060e2e451e4d340b', 'b1f81a24ed63175033edb976ae950f32ddc980349c0876230245dae99e903277', '028da3d8f6189ea1a991ed575a95169bc2426b446d9f9c0d6aaeb4686e1234b6', 'bdd1840c716cb7c7567dbc150f520d089758061abd4b5ac552441ad56db31fa0', '83e6a978b07a863dfdd51b12d55cbc373d4e5f85a4a3abb6ec9dfd11f60fc4c3', 'dd8c0615ee4ee4703ca4eb6aad2a8229c681c40a913581c2ac2caa090a492d5e']"
242,291,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=291,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2007-11-22,Scott Aaronson,Thanksgiving Special: D-Wave at MIT,"Some people think I have a vendetta against D-Wave Systems and its questionable quantum computer claims (see here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here for context). But actually, nothing could be further from the truth. I keep trying and trying to change the subject! Wouldn’t you all rather hear about Wolfram, I say? Or unparadoxes? Or my #1 topic du jour, nothing whatsoever?
Apparently you wouldn’t. From my inbox to my comments section to the hallway, the masses have spoken, and what they want to know is: did I attend D-Wave’s presentation at MIT on Monday, and if so what did I think?
Yes, I attended, in body though not in mind. You see, Monday was also the day of the STOC deadline, so if our guests from D-Wave (Mohammad Amin and Andrew Berkley) were expecting a ferocious skeptic, they instead got a bleary-eyed zombie with visions of MAEXP, P/poly, and 7:59PM EST cavorting in his head.
This meant that Ed Farhi, Isaac Chuang, Peter Shor, and Lorenza Viola had to do most of the questioning. As it turned out, they did a vastly better job than I could have.
As others have pointed out in stronger terms, I’m not a physicist. (On the other hand, the gentleman linked to in the previous sentence is not correct about my being paid by the NSA to discredit Canadian quantum computing efforts: it’s actually the GCHQ and the Mossad.) As such, I can’t directly evaluate D-Wave’s central claim to have built an adiabatic quantum computer, nor have I ever tried to do so. All I can do is point out the many things D-Wave has said to the press (about NP-complete problems, for example) that I know are false, its history of making dramatic announcements without evidence, and its contemptuous attitude toward scientists who have asked for such evidence. For me, that’s more than enough to destroy D-Wave’s credibility on the claims I can’t directly evaluate. After all, the burden of proof is not on me; it’s on them.
However, other people have not been satisfied with this line of argument. “We don’t care who the burden the proof is on,” they say. “We just care whether D-Wave built an adiabatic quantum computer.”
But my physicist colleagues don’t suffer from the same argumentative limitations that I do. At the group meeting preceding the talk, Farhi announced that he didn’t care what the press releases said, nor did he want to discuss what problems quantum computers can solve (since we academics can figure that out ourselves). Instead he wanted to focus on a single question: is D-Wave’s device a quantum computer or not?
What followed was probably the most intense grilling of an invited speaker I’ve ever seen.
It quickly emerged that D-Wave wants to run a coherent quantum computation for microseconds, even though each of their superconducting qubits will have completely decohered within nanoseconds. Farhi had to ask Amin to repeat this several times, to make sure he’d gotten it right.
Amin’s claim was that what looks like total decoherence in the computational basis is irrelevant — since for adiabatic quantum computation, all that matters is what happens in the basis of energy eigenstates. In particular, Amin claimed to have numerical simulations showing that, if the temperature is smaller than the spectral gap, then one can do adiabatic quantum computation even if the conventional coherence times (the t1 and t2) would manifestly seem to prohibit it.
The physicists questioned Amin relentlessly on this one claim. I think it’s fair to say that they emerged curious but severely skeptical, not at all convinced by the calculations Amin provided, and determined to study the issue for themselves.
In other words, this was science as it should be. In contrast to their bosses, Amin and Berkley made a genuine effort to answer questions. They basically admitted that D-Wave’s press releases were litanies of hype and exaggeration, but nevertheless thought they had a promising path to a quantum computer. On several occasions, they seemed to be struggling to give an honest answer that would still uphold the company line.
Two other highlights:
- I asked Amin and Berkley whether they could give any evidence for any sort of speedup over classical simulated annealing. They laughed at this. “It’s sixteen qubits!” they said. “Of course you’re not going to see a scaling effect with sixteen qubits.”I said I understood perfectly well (though I wondered silently whether the dozens of journalists covering D-Wave’s demo understood the same). But, I continued, surely you should be able to see a scaling effect by the end of 2008, when your business plan calls for 1024 qubits?”Well, that’s what it says in the press release,” they said.Forget about the press release, Farhi interjected. How many qubits are you actually going to make?Amin and Berkley shrugged; they said they’d just try to make as many qubits as they could.
- Even though it hadn’t exhibited any sort of speedup, Amin and Berkley steadfastly maintained that their 16-qubit device was indeed a quantum computer. Their evidence was that simulations of its behavior that took quantum mechanics into account gave, they said, a better fit to the data than simulations that didn’t. On the other hand, they said they were not able to test directly for the presence of any quantum effect such as entanglement. (They agreed that entanglement was a non-negotiable requirement for quantum computing.)There was a Feynmanesque moment, when Ike Chuang asked Amin and Berkley an experimental question so simple even I understood it. Ike said: if you’re indeed seeing quantum effects, then by running your computer at higher and higher temperatures, at some point you should see a transition to classical behavior. Have you tried this simple control experiment?Amin and Berkley said that they hadn’t, but that it sounded like a good idea.
For a theorist like me — accustomed to talks ending with “if there are no questions, then let’s thank the speaker again” — this was exciting, heady stuff. And when it was over, I still had almost three hours until the STOC deadline.",6058,"['b73c89f130d263075a0c299d211cf4faa1afd3be34784a599efc055129a2f22f',

243,284,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=284,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2007-10-28,Scott Aaronson,The Aaronson $25.00 Prize,"For those of you who’ve been living in a non-wifi-enabled cave, four days ago Stephen Wolfram awarded a $25,000 prize to a 20-year-old undergraduate named Alex Smith, for proving that a particular two-state, three-symbol Turing machine is universal. The prize was to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Wolfram’s paradigm-smashing, foundation-shaking masterpiece, A New Kind of Science. (More from Bill Gasarch’s blog, Nature, and Scientific American.)
Smith sounds like a swell guy who entered this contest for exactly the right reasons: he was at his parents’ place over summer break and had nothing better to do. He deserves the money, and I sincerely hope the CS theory community hasn’t heard the last from him.
Predictably, though, as soon as this story broke I started getting emails from journalists asking me about the far-reaching scientific implications of the new universality proof. In trying to give them an honest answer — one that wouldn’t be misunderstood, or spun to support a pre-existing storyline with which I disagreed — I inevitably came off like an ornery old sourpuss. From Scientific American:
Of course, there may be a reason the problem languished. “Finding the smallest universal [Turing machines] is a neat recreational pursuit,” quantum computation researcher Scott Aaronson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says, but “it’s no longer seen as connected to the central questions of the field.” …
“The impact of NKS on all the areas of computer science and physics I’m familiar with has been basically zero,” he says. “As far as I can tell, the main impact is that people now sometimes use the adjective ‘Wolframian’ to describe breathtaking claims for the trivial or well-known.” [Martin] Davis offers a sunnier take: “The book has a lot of beautiful pictures.”
And from Nature:
The solution isn’t hugely relevant to modern computer science, says Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Most theoretical computer scientists don’t particularly care about finding the smallest universal Turing machines,” he wrote in an e-mail. “They see it as a recreational pursuit that interested people in the 60s and 70s but is now sort of ‘retro’.”
Having partially degrumpified, in the remainder of this post I wish to offer something positive.
But first some background: a month after NKS came out, I wrote a review of it for the journal Quantum Information and Computation, in which I examined Wolfram’s claims about quantum mechanics and computational complexity, and explained what I saw as the problems with them. (Rather than rehash the review, I’ll just point you there if you’re interested.)
Today I’d like to celebrate the fifth anniversary of my critical review of NKS, by offering a $25 prize for stodgy, conventional work in the field of quantum complexity theory.
The Aaronson $25.00 Challenge
In NKS, Wolfram places himself among those computer scientists and physicists who doubt the possibility of quantum computers, not for any practical reason but as a consequence of their disbelieving quantum mechanics itself. As he writes on page 771:
Indeed within the usual formalism [of quantum mechanics] one can construct quantum computers that may be able to solve at least a few specific problems exponentially faster than ordinary Turing machines. But particularly after my discoveries in Chapter 9 [‘Fundamental Physics’], I strongly suspect that even if this is formally the case, it will still not turn out to be a true representation of ultimate physical reality, but will instead just be found to reflect various idealizations made in the models used so far.
Here, then, is the challenge:
If a quantum computer can efficiently solve a problem, can it also efficiently convince Wolfram that the solution is correct? More formally, does every language in the class BQP admit an interactive protocol where the prover is in BQP and the verifier is in BPP?
In other words: can quantum computers always “show their work”? It’s obvious, for example, that if a quantum computer spit out the factors of a 5,000-digit number, you wouldn’t have to believe quantum mechanics (or even know what it was) to check whether the answer was right. I’m asking whether every problem solvable by a quantum computer has the same property. And to make things fair to the quantum computer, I’ll let it give not just a static proof but also an interactive protocol, by which a distrustful polynomial-time classical verifier could become convinced, to arbitrarily high confidence, that the quantum computer knows the right answer.
(An example for the uninitiated: suppose you had two graphs G and H, and suppose you picked one of the graphs at random, randomly permuted its vertices, and gave the result to a quantum computer. And suppose the quantum computer could unfailingly tell you which graph you started with. Clearly this should convince you that G and H are not isomorphic — since if they were isomorphic, then the quantum computer couldn’t have done better than guessing! And this is true even though you never received a proof of non-isomorphism that you could hand to someone else.)
I’ll award $25 either for a proof that every quantum computation can be “counter-Wolframized,” or for an oracle relative to which some quantum computation provably can’t be. If both problems are solved then I’ll award $25 for each. Every serious submission will be reviewed by a Prize Committee consisting of me. The Committee may also choose to award smaller prizes for partial results.
Note: Much as I’d like to “pull a Wolfram,” the beautiful question above was (to my knowledge) first asked by Daniel Gottesman, at a conference in February 2004. Also, the idea of a $25 prize was suggested to me by Mike Mosca.
Update (10/30): A commenter pointed me to this thread in the Foundations of Mathematics (FOM) mailing list, which contains an actual technical discussion of Smith’s universality proof. Of particular interest:
- an argument by Vaughan Pratt that Smith’s universality proof is wrong,
- a response by Todd Rowland of Wolfram Research,
- a post from Wolfram himself, which, though written in his trademark way, comes the closest I’ve seen of anything by him to addressing actual hard questions about the definition of universality, and
- this comment from John McCarthy: “In the 1950s I thought that the smallest possible (symbol-state product) universal Turing machine would tell something about the nature of computation. Unfortunately, it didn’t. Instead as simpler universal machines were discovered, the proofs that they were universal became more elaborate, and [so] did the encodings of information.”
In judging the correctness of Smith’s proof, the key question is what counts as “universality.” As I explained to the journalists who emailed me, the rules of Wolfram’s prize left a huge gray area by explicitly refusing to specify this. In particular: what kinds of input and output encodings are allowed? How do we make sure the real computational work is done by the Turing machine itself and not the encoding procedures? Does the tape have to be filled with 0’s initially, or can it be filled with other patterns, and if so which ones? Since the two-state Turing machine in question has no “halt” state, what external conditions can we impose to determine when the machine has halted?
Still, I decided not to make a fuss about such things in my original post, since it seemed clear from Smith’s writeup that (1) he was aware of these issues, and (2) there was some nontrivial sense in which he proved universality. I wasn’t going to lose sleep over which sense, for the simple reason that I’d never lost sleep over the (2,3) universality question itself!",7767,"['5aa3fd1a02404bfce5d344dbfac7e2829d476067bfdfae0a6a70099d4e31b633', '68748a9965879a058498b3965b2dfe0d58f4e680ae2ea96e8826d5d66c035a5d',

Model 2: Well, from my perspective, it’s about information, probabilities, and observables, and how they relate to each other.
Model 1: That’s interesting!
The commercial then flashes the tagline “A more intelligent model,” followed by a picture of a Ricoh printer.
More intelligent, or simply more shameless? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, allow me to quote from Lecture 9 of my Quantum Computing Since Democritus notes:
But if quantum mechanics isn’t physics in the usual sense — if it’s not about matter, or energy, or waves, or particles — then what is it about? From my perspective, it’s about information and probabilities and observables, and how they relate to each other.
For almost the first time in my life, I’m at a loss for words. I don’t know how to respond. I don’t know which of 500,000 possible jokes to make. Help me, readers. Should I be flattered? Should I be calling a lawyer?
Update (10/3): [Sydney Morning Herald] [The Age] [Slashdot] [BoingBoing] [AdNews] [Scientific American blog] (Let me know if you find others) (I’m actually in Riga, Latvia, where it’s 8:30am, and just woke up to find all this. I’m going to take a shower now.)
Also: Please let me know if you get any more “CPU quota exceeded” errors. I just enabled an option to speed up PHP scripts, which might or might not solve the problem. Bluehost sucks — never use them for anything!
Update (10/4): Thanks, everyone, for the free legal advice! From half of you I’ve learned that I’d be an arrogant, stereotypically-American jerk to pursue this case further; from the other half I’ve learned that I’d be a naïve idiot not to. The longer I blog, the more I despair of ever achieving my central goal in life, namely for everyone to like me.
Also: Many commenters seem to assume the pilfered quote is just my expression of the conventional wisdom. Well, it should be, and I wish it were! But as Avi Wigderson pointed out to me, the idea that quantum mechanics is about information rather than waves or particles is still extremely non-standard, and would have been considered insane fifteen years ago.
Update (10/5): This is not to say it’s my idea (as other commenters assumed I was saying)! If any entity can claim “ownership” of the idea, I would think it’s the entire quantum computing and information community. The longer I blog, the more I despair of ever achieving my secondary goal in life, namely for everyone to understand me.",2869,"['b0a651bfd7a19041361f5626ab3e082f8d582e2f091fcb0f8cc76d74b62d693b',

(Like many of Robin’s posts, this one is written in a purely descriptive mode that nevertheless leaves no doubt where his sympathies lie.) And so, as a firmly-entrenched pillar of the hidebound scientific establishment, I thought I’d tell you our side of the story.
In the US, there are companies whose business it is to patent (or buy patents for) every obvious idea they can think of, then sit around and do nothing with those ideas, wait for some other company to build a successful business around one of them, and sue that company for patent infringement. (The textbook example is NTP’s lawsuit against Research In Motion.)
In science, one occasionally sees the intellectual equivalent of these patent-holding companies: people who publish one flaky idea after another with no data or calculations to back them up; and then if, after years of painstaking research, one of their speculations turns out to be right (or even 10% right), scream “they stole my idea!”
But in my experience — and happily for all concerned — the truth usually lies between this extreme and the opposite extreme described in Robin’s post. To illustrate, let’s consider the example of Robin’s that I know best: that of David Deutsch and quantum computing.
Unlike the patent-holding firms, David Deutsch really was a scientific pioneer, thinking deeply about quantum physics and the Church-Turing Thesis back when basically no one else was. His philosophical insights led him to define the quantum Turing machine model, prove its universality, and realize it might have implications for complexity theory. But his one concrete example of a quantum algorithm — how shall I say? — sucked. In particular, he gave an algorithm to compute the XOR of two bits (and know one has done so) using one quantum query and with success probability 1/2. (Later it was realized that success probability 1 is achievable, but that’s still only a factor-2 speedup compared to classical computers.) If this was all you’d seen of quantum computing, you would rightly file it away with dozens of other promising ideas that hadn’t led anywhere.
Unless, that is, you were Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani. These “conservative radicals” from Berkeley decided to put quantum computing under the microscope of theoretical computer science. The result of their labor — besides a bounteous harvest of complexity theorems like BPP ⊆ BQP ⊆ P#P — was the first example of a black-box problem for which quantum computers gave a superpolynomial speedup over classical randomized ones. Shortly afterward, another conservative, Dan Simon, set out to prove that the speedup of quantum computing was illusory — and ended up with strong evidence (now called Simon’s algorithm) for exactly the opposite conclusion. A year later, yet another conservative — an expert on combinatorics and discrete geometry by the name of Peter Shor — took a close look at Simon’s algorithm, and realized that if you changed the underlying group from (Z2)n to the cyclic group ZN, then you could efficiently compute the period of a black-box function, and thereby factor integers, and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem, and thereby change the world.
A Hansonian might downplay these later achievements — arguing that, were it not for Shor, some other “mainstream mathematician” (a strange description of him!) would’ve sooner or later discovered the factoring algorithm. But it’s equally true that, were it not for Deutsch, some other “renegade physicist” would have come up with quantum Turing machines (and indeed Feynman and Benioff were close). My own judgment is that Deutsch and Shor both made creative scientific contributions of the highest order, and are both deservedly celebrated for them. Indeed, if anyone gets short-shrifted in the usual popular accounts, I think it’s the people in between — like Bernstein, Vazirani, and Simon.
So yes, let’s remember the first person who struck gold, but also the first to realize it wasn’t fools’ gold and the first to figure out how to mine it. Science is a big place; there’s plenty of room for Deutsches, Shors, and even a Vazirani or two.",4350,"['b33481f161a23b4d37711897f5c27cdded96d11c83414f0b9a6d117ce0e72097', '710a60870ec7c1cbf6eccbda445d99bea413553f6c55a6c04f320dee62ca2515', '97a3caa46fb1b895f8b7a45c7ec79b20def7de1dda8c78453333ff5c3e402be3', '938164ca2c934b74c4fbc274d45069a751cf5d39af22bee720f1adfd1fdfbf91', 'fca3c0d46e1a55890319e9b4b52c60a7660a2843ea2149215ce8ec57bab165d2', '519c66c8cfc7277daf077a00f777c46e4ccc2d55376f5760862dd7da6519d74e', 'f4c46cc84bfc771b784db2c17c9c652c95cae4c54a19f9cf0dfce6962c3b2c88', 'eddefd9fa41c2800eecca1e2964d78662c7e7ea9ffefc849e1179e9891da3ec3', '2660042aad3f02cd64ed6eff9975b95d5de7ace074e75779ef89145b9c1bbe94', '78ac8e05b3cdfa38cf97917242a31556343bfaa8ec726c5f3c579bc5de5f057a', '40bf5bf0bcdb2aaea566ea26e8c60b5ef39293a215f93ba9968e7839f88fa3a8', '4e814edee9c8aaec4147d364b65eb24f29c773d519388933cfb8b8f0455900e3', '5281545363aac5b04642669bef0f9f871406b660f6d3a1b2a16b162cf16faf31', '9ad9c8fcfd47c7f1e6ff49899ca2587a1fd09b90570f3fa482a2a294e8be3799', '6567cf78c6016873e1644858e33899099442ad522ff7d192efc4b299ad04b177', '2965356798f6b52df595ccb44b1bcce6a4d902e1263d18c67a181835b894b5b9']"

Black holes as mirrors: quantum information in random subsystems
by Patrick Hayden and John Preskill
Abstract: We study information retrieval from evaporating black holes, assuming that the internal dynamics of a black hole is unitary and rapidly mixing, and assuming that the retriever has unlimited control over the emitted Hawking radiation. If the evaporation of the black hole has already proceeded past the “half-way” point, where half of the initial entropy has been radiated away, then additional quantum information deposited in the black hole is revealed in the Hawking radiation very rapidly. Information deposited prior to the half-way point remains concealed until the half-way point, and then emerges quickly. These conclusions hold because typical local quantum circuits are efficient encoders for quantum error-correcting codes that nearly achieve the capacity of the quantum erasure channel. Our estimate of a black hole’s information retention time, based on speculative dynamical assumptions, is just barely compatible with the black hole complementarity hypothesis.
Many of this paper’s arguments depend on speculative assumptions about quantum gravity, and might very well be wrong. What’s nice is simply that they’re not not even wrong! This is an 18-page paper about the Planck-scale dynamics of black hole horizons where I never once found myself wondering what the authors were trying to say, or how their ideas would in principle be tested.
When I used to spout off about the complexity of retrieving information from a black hole as a function of the Schwarzschild radius rS, people assumed I was just fishing for laughs. And they were basically right. But even then, I felt sure that actual physicists would eventually say something real about this question, unapologetically using the language of quantum computing and information.

Hardcore Shtetl-Optimized fans will find little here to surprise them, but for new or occasional readers, this is about the clearest statement I’ve written of my religio-ethico-complexity-theoretic beliefs.
What Google Won’t Find
As I probably mentioned when I spoke at your Mountain View location two years ago, it’s a funny feeling when an entity that knows everything that ever can be known or has been known or will be known invites you to give a talk — what are you supposed to say?
Well, I thought I’d talk about “What Google Won’t Find.” In other words, what have we learned over the last 15 years or so about the ultimate physical limits of search — whether it’s search of a physical database like Google’s, or of the more abstract space of solutions to a combinatorial problem?
On the spectrum of computer science, I’m about as theoretical as you can get. One way to put it is that I got through CS grad school at Berkeley without really learning any programming language other than QBASIC. So it might surprise you that earlier this year, I was spending much of my time talking to business reporters. Why? Because there was this company near Vancouver called D-Wave Systems, which was announcing to the press that it had built the world’s first commercial quantum computer.
Let’s ignore the “commercial” part, because I don’t really understand economics — these days, you can apparently make billions of dollars giving away some service for free! Let’s instead focus on the question: did D-Wave actually build a quantum computer? Well, they apparently built a device with 16 very noisy superconducting quantum bits (or qubits), which they say they’ve used to help solve extremely small Sudoku puzzles.
The trouble is, we’ve known for years that if qubits are sufficiently noisy — if they leak a sufficient amount of information into their environment — then they behave essentially like classical bits. Furthermore, D-Wave has refused to answer extremely basic technical questions about how high their noise rates are and so forth — they care about serving their customers, not answering nosy questions from academics. (Recently D-Wave founder Geordie Rose offered to answer my questions if I was interested in buying one of his machines. I replied that I was interested — my offer was $10 US — and I now await his answers as a prospective customer.)
To make a long story short, it’s consistent with the evidence that what D-Wave actually built would best be described as a 16-bit classical computer. I don’t mean 16 bits in terms of the architecture; I mean sixteen actual bits. And there’s some prior art for that.
But that’s actually not what annoyed me the most about the D-Wave announcement. What annoyed me were all the articles in the popular press — including places as reputable as The Economist — that said, what D-Wave has built is a machine that can try every possible solution in parallel and instantly pick the right one. This is what a quantum computer is; this is how it works.
It’s amazing to me how, as soon as the word “quantum” is mentioned, all the ordinary rules of journalism go out the window. No one thinks to ask: is that really what a quantum computer could do?
It turns out that, even though we don’t yet have scalable quantum computers, we do know something about what they could do if we did have them.
A quantum computer is a device that would exploit the laws of quantum mechanics to solve certain computational problems asymptotically faster than we know how to solve them with any computer today. Quantum mechanics — which has been our basic framework for physics for the last 80 years — is a theory that’s like probability theory, except that instead of real numbers called probabilities, you now have complex numbers called amplitudes. And the interesting thing about these complex numbers is that they can “interfere” with each other: they can cancel each other out.
In particular, to find the probability of something happening, you have to add the amplitudes for all the possible ways it could have happened, and then take the square of the absolute value of the result. And if some of the ways an event could happen have positive amplitude and others have negative amplitude, then the amplitudes can cancel out, so that the event doesn’t happen at all. This is exactly what’s going on in the famous double-slit experiment: at certain spots on a screen, the different paths a photon could’ve taken to get to that spot interfere destructively and cancel each other out, and as a result no photon is seen.
Now, the idea of quantum computing is to set up a massive double-slit experiment with exponentially many paths — and to try to arrange things so that the paths leading to wrong answers interfere destructively and cancel each other out, while the paths leading to right answers interfere constructively and are therefore observed with high probability.
You can see it’s a subtle effect that we’re aiming for. And indeed, it’s only for a few specific problems that people have figured out how to choreograph an interference pattern to solve the problem efficiently — that is, in polynomial time.
One of these problems happens to be that of factoring integers. Thirteen years ago, Peter Shor discovered that a quantum computer could efficient apply Fourier transforms over exponentially-large abelian groups, and thereby find the periods of exponentially-long periodic sequences, and thereby factor integers, and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem, and thereby snarf people’s credit card numbers. So that’s one application of quantum computers.
On the other hand — and this is the most common misconception about quantum computing I’ve encountered — we do not, repeat do not, know a quantum algorithm to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. For “generic” problems of finding a needle in a haystack, most of us believe that quantum computers will give at most a polynomial advantage over classical ones.
At this point I should step back. How many of you have heard of the following question: Does P=NP?
Yeah, this is a problem so profound that it’s appeared on at least two TV shows (The Simpsons and NUMB3RS). It’s also one of the seven (now six) problems for which the Clay Math Institute is offerring a million-dollar prize for a solution.
Apparently the mathematicians had to debate whether P vs. NP was “deep” enough to include in their list. Personally, I take it as obvious that it’s the deepest of them all. And the reason is this: if you had a fast algorithm for solving NP-complete problems, then not only could you solve P vs. NP, you could presumably also solve the other six problems. You’d simply program your computer to search through all possible proofs of at most (say) a billion symbols, in some formal system like Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. If such a proof existed, you’d find it in a reasonable amount of time. (And if the proof had more than a billion symbols, it’s not clear you’d even want to see it!)
This raises an important point: many people — even computer scientists — don’t appreciate just how profound the consequences would be if P=NP. They think it’s about scheduling airline flights better, or packing more boxes in your truck. Of course, it is about those things — but the point is that you can have a set of boxes such that if you could pack them into your truck, then you would also have proved the Riemann Hypothesis!
Of course, while the proof eludes us, we believe that P≠NP. We believe there’s no algorithm to solve NP-complete problems in deterministic polynomial time. But personally, I would actually make a stronger conjecture:
There is no physical means to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time — not with classical computers, not with quantum computers, not with anything else.
You could call this the “No SuperSearch Principle.” It says that, if you’re going to find a needle in a haystack, then you’ve got to expend at least some computational effort sifting through the hay.
I see this principle as analogous to the Second Law of Thermodynamics or the impossibility of superluminal signalling. That is, it’s a technological limitation which is also a pretty fundamental fact about the laws of physics. Like those other principles, it could always be falsified by experiment, but after a while it seems manifestly more useful to assume it’s true and then see what the consequences are for other things.
OK, so what do we actually know about the ability of quantum computers to solve NP-complete problems efficiently? Well, of course we can’t prove it’s impossible, since we can’t even prove it’s impossible for classical computers — that’s the P vs. NP problem! We might hope to at least prove that quantum computers can’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time unless classical computers can also — but even that, alas, seems far beyond our ability to prove.
What we can prove is this: suppose you throw away the structure of an NP-complete problem, and just consider it as an abstract, featureless space of 2n possible solutions, where the only thing you can do is guess a solution and check whether it’s right or not. In that case it’s obvious that a classical computer will need ~2n steps to find a solution. But what if you used a quantum computer, which could “guess” all possible solutions in superposition? Well, even then, you’d still need at least ~2n/2 steps to find a solution. This is called the BBBV Theorem, and was one of the first things learned about the power of quantum computers.
Intuitively, even though a quantum computer in some sense involves exponentially many paths or “parallel universes,” the single universe that happened on the answer can’t shout above all the other universes: “hey, over here!” It can only gradually make the others aware of its presence.
As it turns out, the 2n/2 bound is actually achievable. For in 1996, Lov Grover showed that a quantum computer can search a list of N items using only √N steps. It seems to me that this result should clearly feature in Google’s business plan.
Of course in real life, NP-complete problems do have structure, and algorithms like local search and backtrack search exploit that structure. Because of this, the BBBV theorem can’t rule out a fast quantum algorithm for NP-complete problems. It merely shows that, if such an algorithm existed, then it couldn’t work the way 99% of everyone who’s ever heard of quantum computing thinks it would!
You might wonder whether there’s any proposal for a quantum algorithm that would exploit the structure of NP-complete problems. As it turns out, there’s one such proposal: the “quantum adiabatic algorithm” of Farhi et al., which can be seen as the quantum version of simulated annealing. Intriguingly, Farhi and his collaborators proved that, on some problem instances where classical simulated annealing would take exponential time, the quantum adiabatic algorithm takes only polynomial time. Alas, we also know of problem instances where the adiabatic algorithm takes exponential time just as simulated annealing does. So while this is still an active research area, right now the adiabatic algorithm does not look like a magic bullet for solving NP-complete problems.
If quantum computers can’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, it raises an extremely interesting question: is there any physical means to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time?
Well, there have been lots of proposals. One of my favorites involves taking two glass plates with pegs between them, and dipping the resulting contraption into a tub of soapy water. The idea is that the soap bubbles that form between the pegs should trace out the minimum Steiner tree — that is, the minimum total length of line segments connecting the pegs, where the segments can meet at points other than the pegs themselves. Now, this is known to be an NP-hard optimization problem. So, it looks like Nature is solving NP-hard problems in polynomial time!
You might say there’s an obvious difficulty: the soap bubbles could get trapped in a local optimum that’s different from the global optimum. By analogy, a rock in a mountain crevice could reach a lower state of potential energy by rolling up first and then down … but is rarely observed to do so!
And if you said that, you’d be absolutely right. But that didn’t stop two guys a few years ago from writing a paper in which they claimed, not only that soap bubbles solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, but that that fact proves P=NP! In debates about this paper on newsgroups, several posters raised the duh-obvious point that soap bubbles can get trapped at local optima. But then another poster opined that that’s just an academic “party line,” and that he’d be willing to bet that no one had actually done an experiment to prove it.
Long story short, I went to the hardware store, bought some glass plates, liquid soap, etc., and found that, while Nature does often find a minimum Steiner tree with 4 or 5 pegs, it tends to get stuck at local optima with larger numbers of pegs. Indeed, often the soap bubbles settle down to a configuration which is not even a tree (i.e. contains “cycles of soap”), and thus provably can’t be optimal.
The situation is similar for protein folding. Again, people have said that Nature seems to be solving an NP-hard optimization problem in every cell of your body, by letting the proteins fold into their minimum-energy configurations. But there are two problems with this claim. The first problem is that proteins, just like soap bubbles, sometimes get stuck in suboptimal configurations — indeed, it’s believed that’s exactly what happens with Mad Cow Disease. The second problem is that, to the extent that proteins do usually fold into their optimal configurations, there’s an obvious reason why they would: natural selection! If there were a protein that could only be folded by proving the Riemann Hypothesis, the gene that coded for it would quickly get weeded out of the gene pool.
So: quantum computers, soap bubbles, proteins … if we want to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time in the physical world, what’s left? Well, we can try going to more exotic physics. For example, since we don’t yet have a quantum theory of gravity, people have felt free to speculate that if we did have one, it would give us an efficient way to solve NP-complete problems. For example, maybe the theory would allow closed timelike curves, which would let us solve NP-complete and even harder problems by (in some sense) sending the answer back in time to before we started.
In my view, though, it’s more likely that a quantum theory of gravity will do the exact opposite: that is, it will limit our computational powers, relative to what they would’ve been in a universe without gravity. To see why, consider one of the oldest “extravagant” computing proposals: the Zeno computer. This is a computer that runs the first step of a program in one second, the second step in half a second, the third step in a quarter second, the fourth step in an eighth second, and so on, so that after two seconds it’s run infinitely many steps. (It reminds me of the old joke about the supercomputer that was so fast, it could do an infinite loop in 2.5 seconds.)
Question from the floor: In what sense is this even a “proposal”?
Answer: Well, it’s a proposal in the sense that people actually write papers about it! (Google “hypercomputation.”) Whether they should be writing those papers a separate question…
Now, the Zeno computer strikes most computer scientists — me included — as a joke. But why is it a joke? Can we say anything better than that it feels absurd to us?
As it turns out, this question takes us straight into some of the frontier issues in theoretical physics. In particular, one of the few things physicists think they know about quantum gravity — one of the few things both the string theorists and their critics largely agree on — is that, at the so-called “Planck scale” of about 10-33 centimeters or 10-43 seconds, our usual notions of space and time are going to break down. As one manifestation of this, if you tried to build a clock that ticked more than about 1043 times per second, that clock would use so much energy that it would collapse to a black hole. Ditto for a computer that performed more than about 1043 operations per second, or for a hard disk that stored more than about 1069 bits per square meter of surface area. (Together with the finiteness of the speed of light and the exponential expansion of the universe, this implies that, contrary to what you might have thought, there is a fundamental physical limit on how much disk space Gmail will ever be able to offer its subscribers…)
To summarize: while I believe what I called the “No SuperSearch Principle” — that is, while I believe there are fundamental physical limits to efficient computer search — I hope I’ve convinced you that understanding why these limits exist takes us straight into some of the deepest issues in math and physics. To me that’s so much the better — since it suggests that not only are the limits correct, but (more importantly) they’re also nontrivial.

The first part of the program is about Australia’s population of cane toads (or rather, “tie-oads”). Then at 32:40, they start in with a report on the FQXi conference in Iceland, and interviews with Max Tegmark, Fred Adams, and Simon Saunders. I’m from 39:10 to 46:50.
A few comments/corrections:
- The interviewer, Pauline Newman, asks me about the practical implications of the collision lower bound, and then cuts to me talking about how quantum computers could break the RSA cryptosystem. Of course, the connection is only an indirect one (the collision lower bound is what gives hope that one could design collision-resistant hash functions that, unlike RSA, are secure even against quantum attacks).
- I said that, when trying to solve jigsaw puzzles or schedule airline flights, there doesn’t seem to be anything one can do that’s fundamentally better than trying every possibility. I should have added, “in the worst case.”
- The reason I mentioned how old I was when IP=PSPACE was proved is not that I’m a narcissist (though I am), but because in a section that was cut, Pauline asked me if I proved IP=PSPACE, and I was trying to make it clear that I didn’t. The theorem was proved by Shamir, building on work of Lund, Fortnow, Karloff, and Nisan.
- Pauline’s assertion that I “took off on a snowmobile without [my] passenger” and “left a distinguished physicist stranded on a glacier” is a gross exaggeration. What happened was, I waited and waited for someone — anyone — to climb onto my snowmobile. When no one did (maybe because everyone was scared by my abysmal driving ability), I figured I should just go.

For now, please content yourself with the following remarks, which I delivered to the assembled pontificators after a day of small-group conversation in a geothermally-heated lagoon.
I’ve been entrusted to speak for our group, consisting of myself, Greg Chaitin, Max Tegmark, Paul Benioff, Caslav Brukner, and Graham Collins.
Our group reached no firm conclusions about anything whatsoever.
Part of the problem was that one of our members — Max Tegmark — was absent most of the time. He was preoccupied with more important matters, like posing for the TV cameras.
So, we tried to do the best we could in Max’s absence. One question we talked about a lot was whether the laws of physics are continuous or discrete at a fundamental level. Or to put it another way: since, as we learned from Max, we’re literally living in a mathematical object, does that object contain a copy of the reals?
One of us — me — argued that this is actually an ill-posed question. For it’s entirely consistent with current knowledge that our universe is discrete at the level of observables — including energy, length, volume, and so on — but continuous at the level of quantum amplitudes. As an analogy, consider a classical coin that’s heads with probability p and tails with probability 1-p. To describe p, you need a continuous parameter — and yet when you observe the coin, you get just a single bit of information. Is this mysterious? I have trouble seeing why it should be.
We also talked a lot about the related question of how much information is “really” in a quantum state. If we consider a single qubit — α|0〉 + β|1〉 — does it contain one bit of classical information, since that’s how many you get from measuring the qubit; two bits, because of the phenomenon of superdense coding; or infinitely many bits, since that’s how many it takes to specify the qubit?
You can probably guess my answer to this question. You may have heard of the “Shut Up and Calculate Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics,” which was popularized by Feynman. I don’t actually adhere to that interpretation: I like to discuss things that neither I nor anyone else has any idea about, which is precisely why I came to this wonderful conference in Iceland. I do, however, adhere to the closely-related “What Kind of Answer Were You Looking For?” Interpretation.
So for example: if you ask me how much information is in a quantum state, I can show you that if you meant A then the answer is B, whereas if you meant C the answer is D, etc. But suppose you then say “yes, but how much information is really there?” Well, imagine a plumber who fixes your toilet, and explains to you that if the toilet gets clogged you do this; if you want to decrease its water usage you do that, etc. And suppose you then ask: “Yes, but what is the true nature of toilet-ness?” Wouldn’t the plumber be justified in responding: “Look, buddy, you’re paying me by the hour. What is it you want me to do?”
A more subtle question is the following: if we consider an entangled quantum state |ψ〉 of n qubits, does the amount of information in |ψ〉 grow exponentially with n, or does it grow linearly or quadratically with n? We know that to specify the state even approximately you need an exponential amount of information — that was the point Paul Davies made earlier, when he argued (fallaciously, in my opinion) that an entangled state of 400 qubits already violates the holographic bound on the maximum number of bits in the observable universe. But what if we only want to predict the outcomes of those measurements that could be performed within the lifetime of the universe? Or what if we only want to predict the outcomes of most measurements drawn from some probability distribution? In these cases, recent results due to myself and others show that the amount of information is much less than one would naïvely expect. In particular, the number of bits grows linearly rather than exponentially with the number of qubits n.
We also talked about hidden-variable theories like Bohmian mechanics. The problem is, given that these theories are specifically constructed to be empirically indistinguishable from standard quantum mechanics, how could we ever tell if they’re true or false? I pointed out that this question is not quite as hopeless as it seems — and in particular, that the issue we discussed earlier of discreteness versus continuity actually has a direct bearing on it.
What is Bohmian mechanics? It’s a theory of the positions of particles in three-dimensional space. Furthermore, the key selling point of the theory is that the positions evolve deterministically: once you’ve fixed the positions at any instant of time, in a way consistent with Born’s probability rule, the particles will then move deterministically in such a way that they continue to obey Born’s rule at all later times. But if — as we’re told by quantum theories of gravity — the right Hilbert space to describe our universe is finite-dimensional, one can prove that no theory of this sort can possibly work. The reason is that, if you have a system in the state |A〉 and it’s mapped to (where |A〉, |B〉, and |C〉 are all elements of the hidden-variable basis), then the hidden variable (which starts in state |A〉) is forced to make a random jump to either |B〉 or |C〉: you’ve created entropy where there wasn’t any before. The way Bohm gets around this problem is by assuming the wavefunctions are continuous. But in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, every wavefunction is discontinuous!
We also talked a good deal about the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics — in particular, what exactly it means for the parallel worlds to “exist” — but since there’s some other branch of the wavefunction where I told you all about that, there’s no need to do so in this one.
Oh, yeah: we also talked about eternal inflation, and more specifically the following question: should the “many worlds” of inflationary cosmology be seen as just a special case of the “many worlds” of the Everett interpretation? More concretely, should the quantum state you ascribe to your surroundings be a probabilistic mixture of all the inflationary “bubbles” that you could possibly find yourself in?
Other topics included Bell inequalities, the definition of randomness, and probably others I’ve forgotten about.
Finally, I wanted to take the liberty of mentioning a truly radical idea, which arose in a dinner conversation with Avi Loeb and Fotini Markopoulou. This idea is so far-out and heretical that I hesitate to bring it up even at this conference. Should I go ahead?
Moderator: Sure!
Well, OK then. The idea was that, when we’re theorizing about the nature of the universe, we might hypothetically want some way of, you know, “testing” whether our theories are right or not. Indeed, maybe we could even go so far as to “reject” the theories that don’t succeed in explaining stuff. As I said, though, this is really just a speculative idea; much further work would be needed to flesh it out.",7158,"['db4860433b8a09dd21f0e6ac663cf08dee6f2d2a9bb5d1954bb5b0fb2d5aca6d', '42cc725a8667658754c9de2ed479cf8b05c0c96ab5ec452d1eb325cf6bd72607', '168322dda24b88015b11a068b0ca84095a6205fa7301e1cd2a488645b3fc7b16', 'df59eb0f14565feb8b3767c2ce5d2d1a0fd5d1946f070905b2f79b45c8057dc9', '15f2d6a75834d0502e55d1b540d77474665bd579521b46614d8ebe2b11e0d6cd', '9db2dc4cfe3fc3f8c8dffb5cb757d03550345a2719cad461e0b2a57d74cd7fc0', '86109b0ba508f024081e7ddf3e2904a6eb7495e6516ae78280df1f3a07bcdc85', '6ce1920b02e25c7696abf83f867234d1334046c83d09e8bc60159af90b46272a', '88f9100a97eb2e92810f7ee3d280d96c5450dfb92d44f3963e74f23545f0e13c', '7c9460df8cf3a85e671d742612952ca739dc408e6677a239321714acc70f1844', 'c38171f96d2dc5a51d00b5e6c948af4f6777eefff4e24432151b2b7a601e35e1', '7e4c7b3e7fd4ee31a5d017990beebe54c325e36896863190a9088eb234d89f64', 'd764d0d251266bce0522f85d384b4916f1cf15e17e1c8a5462917a02193a757d', 'ed0aac8d8aad32836da2b451d4b2efbf6df7201f74b55bf509cf0e0f490eca9a', 'c40e0b1f659ea51c2619ff4e17f458bf2b80750faf9d6d64c122628481c747b4', '2fc6eb9745e17919b45c5115a54faa05f0a10998bd6a6b95af25ef12e5209ad9', '894e25ab7efba2d9ab4f8258a0eae2e564a01f5087aac8b965f0f98a816ddafd', 'dccfffb73976c0d09c209a94fabf39caeb55aa2ad52363b38ad5f4b9e2233699', '630cd3be29a7f0ceb9929cd10aa8add393dd090a0c14024e8df5e3cf89d2a944', 'aebe6c91e7fa7cf01523140ccbf9ef7c572b304b71dbf9e80a254f1c372774dc', '296dda2d1672cc1eb17876b78e9dffa7c73984949fc8e32ecc6ad052911df15b', 'df5401e2bab069c1c31c134807f84f964f48913507dad090ee2f7e5ea79fe1e5', '1f3c60215e1829b05c842a442350f540ef74d042bd5e009b51dff05ece5b5f82', '50ce841e755612d5877bb7b97939f067c8b3928b2622288469c7740ad3493d74', 'e715e0f877288ded300b1b56940f692cb97364fe92a881223f818da59e976baa', 'c764cc95347e24e8eaed60f0a4f42b54b4817a159663461c037254c9ae9dfc56', '4d84be0d40c3b266d8551703ad0787e25af73796eadf07f4611effa2f84e7ea6', '8bd66a3e9cc9f0d6fbaa60bf9004d7670647be81a496c294a52852320f496605', 'da8d4bf1af77f2703ae41a4d7fed68c1e9e19789575a762931512355b279924a', 'd8782c779fb9dbd11a014b9a92ff494516f6c0368c1ed3902e69728bd27ff19d', '51b2c3549ac04dbc020830ac70b4e6905823a6ba8818f2989bd3dbd03472bbb7', 'c04a36c00a0a8fb786dc8ac506b9244341fe81ae1384d5cd74d0562d98dc633d', '441baec9cf1f5711441bc8de8c98a0a0fe86c8123f9e2fac5f337eb0445ae091']"

This drive, while historic, was largely uneventful; the main obstacle we encountered along the way was the state of New York. Still, it was good to have someone around to share the driving, argue about the survival prospects of the human race, and point out when I left my parking brake on.
In return for helping deliver me to my new job alive, Eyal asked for just one thing: a list of papers in quantum computing and information that make explicit connections to foundational issues in physics, connections that even a physicist could recognize as such. (If we allowed implicit connections, we’d have to include pretty much every quantum computing paper ever written.)
There are many requests I can’t satisfy, but this isn’t one of them.

(unfortunately the full text requires a subscription). NEC’s announcement led to the usual fluffified popular articles; see here, here, and here for example. But to satisfy Geordie Rose’s curiosity, my hype-o-meter has not yet reached D-Wave levels, for three reasons.
- These claims haven’t garnered nearly as much ‘quonfusion’ as D-Wave’s in the popular press.
- In this case there is a peer-reviewed paper.
- There’s no claim here about solving NP-complete problems, or indeed about asymptotic complexity at all. The sole claim to originality has to do with “tunable two-qubit couplings,” and I’m not at all well-placed to evaluate it.
Anyway, I thought I should at least mention this work, in the hope that commenters more knowledgeable than I am will weigh in on its significance. Eternal vigilance is the price of quantum computing research.
OK, on to the second breakfast link. Bill Gasarch has reviewed my blog for SIGACT News (scroll down to page 15), together with Lance Fortnow’s and Luca Trevisan’s. Favorite quotes:
Lance is Walter Cronkite. Scott is Stephen Colbert.
The name of the blog, ‘Shtetl-Optimized’ does not really say what it is about. With this in mind one can never say Scott has gone ‘off topic’ since its [sic] not clear what the topic should be.
Incidentally, an uncharitable person might suspect a slight conflict of interest in Bill reviewing Lance’s blog, seeing as Bill now writes Lance’s blog.

Then I fell asleep, and am only just now waking up. On this trip — surely the most exhausting I’ve ever been on — I seem to remember giving a talk on The Limits of Quantum Computers. (You’ll have to go to presentation mode to get the full effect of my PowerPoint animations, and especially the D-Wave montage on slide 2.)
The bulk of the time, however, was taken up with interviews. My interviewers — maybe 20 or 30 at each school, in CS, physics, applied math, even chemistry and electrical engineering — asked me good questions, questionable questions, hard questions, soft questions, loaded questions, lots of questions. And that’s what enables me, without further ado, to present for your reading enjoyment The Official Hiring Scott Aaronson FAQ.
[Note: The questions below are all things that I was actually asked by at least one interviewer — in some cases, by dozens of interviewers.]
Q: What will you do if quantum computing doesn’t pan out in the next 20 years?
A: This question presupposes that quantum computing should be judged as a high-risk engineering project. But that’s never been my view. My view is that it should be judged as basic science. What we’re trying to do is unify the theory of computing with our best theory of the physical world, and to perform the most stringent tests to which quantum mechanics itself has ever been subjected. For me, the payoff for better scientific understanding is not in some remote future — it’s as soon as the understanding is achieved.
Q: But why should we care about basic science?
A: Uhh, we are called the computer science department…
Q: Does quantum computing really belong in CS departments, as opposed to physics departments?
A: It belongs if we want it to belong! In my experience, the physicists have a bigger hurdle than the computer scientists in getting started with quantum computing research. All we need to do is ask ourselves: “what happens if we generalize probability theory to allow minus signs, and base it on the L2 norm instead of the L1 norm?” From then on it’s just the concepts we know and love: states, transformations, recursion, reductions, universality, asymptotic efficiency, and so on. Physicists, by contrast, have to learn most of this stuff for the first time. It’s been a great personal pleasure to watch physicists who once suspected that CS was devoid of intellectual content, struggle with that content while trying to learn quantum computing!
Now, if we want to take a dramatic scientific development that wouldn’t have been possible without computer science, and hand it over to the physicists on a silver platter, that’s certainly our prerogative. But is it in our interest as a field?
Q: What if quantum computing is fundamentally impossible?
A: That would be much more interesting than if it’s possible! Merely building a quantum computer would be the more boring outcome — the one consistent with all the physics we already know.
Q: But no one really questions quantum mechanics, do they?
A: Well, you just did!
Q: No, I only questioned whether quantum computing is possible. Couldn’t quantum mechanics be valid, but quantum computing still be impossible because of noise and decoherence?
A: If so, then there’s something enormous that we don’t yet understand about the relevant physics. Look, in light of the Threshold Theorem (that if the rate of decoherence per qubit per time step is smaller than some constant threshold, then one can perform an arbitrarily long quantum computation), it’s hard to maintain that we’re talking about some niggling technical issue. What we’re really talking about is this: to keep track of the state of N entangled particles, does Nature have to do an amount of computational work that increases exponentially with N? And if it doesn’t, then (turning the question around) is there an efficient classical algorithm to simulate the behavior of N entangled particles? These are not questions that will just go away for some trivial reason that everyone’s overlooked.
Q: Suppose Ed Witten spent a week thinking about it, and came up with some profound reason why quantum computing is impossible. What would you do next?
A: I’d drop whatever else I was doing, and devote all of my time to understanding the implications of his discovery for computer science and physics!
[Pause]
Of course, since this is Witten, maybe he would’ve spent a second week and worked out all the implications himself. So I guess all I can say is that to my knowledge, he hasn’t in fact been thinking about these issues.
Q: How long until we have practical quantum computers?
A: In my opinion, quantum computing experiments are not yet at a stage where one can make “Moore’s Law” type predictions. We might be in the same situation with quantum computing that Babbage was with classical computing in the 1840’s. In other words, we think we know the fundamental principles, and we’re right — but the technology isn’t there yet, and might not be for a long time.
Of course, as with any technology, progress could happen faster than almost any of us expect. But I prefer to be pessimistic: that way either you’re right, or else you don’t mind being wrong!
Q: How many qubits are the experimentalists at so far?
A: It depends how you measure. People got up to twelve qubits in liquid-state NMR, the platform that was used some years ago to factor 15 into 3×5 (at least with high probability!). The trouble with liquid NMR is that no one knows how to scale it: currently the signal decreases exponentially with the number of qubits. So people turned their attention to other platforms, such as ion traps, photonics, and solid-state NMR. With these platforms the quantum computer’s state is much closer to being pure, so the prospects for scalability are much better. But manipulating the qubits is correspondingly harder. With ion traps, Rainer Blatt’s group in Innsbruck did tomography of an 8-qubit state, and other groups have done computations involving 2 or 3 qubits. With photonics, it’s easy to get a huge number of qubits that are highly coherent; the problem is that photons don’t like to talk to each other (in fact they fly right past each other), and therefore you can only apply two-qubit gates by using matter particles as intermediaries.
There are other more exotic proposals for scalable quantum computing, such as “nonabelian anyons.” With these I think it’s fair to say we’re not even at one qubit yet. But if these proposals did work, then the hope would be that they could leapfrog over the other proposals by building in error-correction for free.
Q: Which universities in North America are the major centers for quantum computing theory?
A: Right now there are four: Waterloo, Caltech, MIT, and Berkeley.
Q: Supposing we had scalable quantum computers, are your lower-bound results telling us that they would have no applications?
A: Absolutely not. Aside from their intrinsic scientific interest, quantum computers would have real applications. In my opinion, the most important would be the one so obvious that we computer scientists hardly ever talk about it: namely, simulating quantum physics and chemistry! This, of course, is what a quantum computer does in its sleep. At the same time, it’s also a fundamental problem in nanotechnology, high-temperature superconductivity, QCD, and other areas, important enough that Nobel prizes have been awarded even for ways to solve special cases efficiently on a classical computer.
Admittedly, you could say that every physical system in the universe is a quantum computer computing its own evolution! But the goal here would be to build a universal quantum simulator: a single machine that can be programmed to efficiently simulate any quantum system of interest. It’s the difference between building a wind tunnel versus writing code in order to simulate an airplane.
Now, by a sort of lucky accident, we can sometimes coax a quantum computer into solving classical problems asymptotically faster than we know how to solve them with a classical computer. The famous examples are of course (1) breaking RSA and other cryptographic codes, and (2) solving ‘generic’ search problems quadratically faster than a classical computer. These discoveries have enormous theoretical interest, but (as far I can tell) only limited practical interest. Maybe I’m wrong though.
Q: Granted that quantum computing is already interesting as basic science, do you agree that it would be more interesting if we had practical quantum computers?
A: Well, I certainly wouldn’t mind it.
Q: You work on quantum computing, yet most of your research is about how quantum computers wouldn’t be very powerful. Isn’t that a bit strange?
A: In the long run, I don’t think quantum computing research is helped by falsehood. If we’re going to be scientists and not PR flaks, then obviously we ought to welcome the truth, whichever way it goes.
But personally, I’d go even further than that. For me, a model of computation without any limitations would be like Superman without kryptonite. There just wouldn’t be a whole lot to say about it! To my way of thinking, a model that lets you factor integers efficiently but not solve NP-complete problems is actually more interesting than a model that gives you everything!
Oh, and one further point: if you’re interested (as I am) in the ultimate limits of computation, then you’re almost professionally obligated to study quantum computing. Why? Because any time you prove a limit of classical computers, you now have to ask yourself: is this something fundamental, or is it just an artifact of my working in a high-decoherence regime?
Q: Why are you so interested in the limits of computation?
A: To show that something is possible, you just have to find a way to do it. But to show that something’s not possible, you have to consider every way of doing it, and prove that none of them work. This is why negative results are so much rarer than positive results, but also why they often give us deeper understanding.
Q: That seems like an extremely male perspective! [said, jokingly, by a female interviewer]
A: I respectfully disagree. Look, as with pretty much every area of CS, we could certainly use more talented women in quantum computing theory: maybe a few dozen more Dorit Aharonovs, Julia Kempes, and Barbara Terhals. I find the gender imbalance in CS depressing, and I’ve long been interested in what it would take to correct it. But the relevant question is this: is the proportion of women working on quantum lower bounds smaller than the proportion working on quantum algorithms? I don’t think that it is.
Q: What’s your vision for where your research is headed in the next 5-10 years?
A: I know I’m not supposed to say this in an interview, but I don’t have a vision. I have this annoying open problem, that conjecture, this claim that seems wrong to me. I know some people have a coherent vision for where their research is headed. And in experimental areas, obviously you have to justify what you’re going to do with your $200 million of equipment. But at least in theoretical computer science, having a “vision” always seemed incredibly difficult to me.
For example, let’s say you have a vision that you’re going to solve problem X using techniques A, B, C. Then what do you do when you find out that techniques A and C are total nonstarters — but that technique B, while it’s useless for X, does solve a completely unrelated problem Y? What you do is make up a story about how Y was the problem you wanted to solve all along! We all do that: drawing targets around where the arrows hit is simply the business we’re in.
What I can tell you is this: I’m interested in fundamental limits on what can be efficiently computed in the physical world. I look for problems that can be addressed with tools from theoretical computer science, but that also have some physical or philosophical point: something that makes me feel like the universe would be a different place if the conjecture were true than if it were false.
In the past, quantum computing has been an incredibly rich source of that sort of problem for me. But it’s never been my exclusive interest — I’ve also worked on circuit complexity, Bayesian agreement protocols, and even information retrieval and clustering. And if quantum computing ever stops being a source of conceptually rich open problems, then I’ll look for those problems somewhere else.
Q: I noticed that, on at least three occasions where you proved a new quantum lower bound, other people quickly improved it to an optimal bound. Is there a reason why you didn’t prove the optimal bounds yourself?
A: Yeah, I don’t seem to be very good at tightening my lower bounds! I’ve had more success in proving the first nontrivial lower bound for a given problem — that is, in understanding why the complexity scales exponentially rather than polynomially. After that, I’m more than happy to let others pin down the order of the exponential. Every time that’s happened, far from feeling disappointed over being “scooped,” I felt great that my work gave other people a foundation to build on.
Q: You look tired. Would you like some coffee?
A: Yes.
Q: How did you get interested in quantum computing?
A: When I first learned about programming as an 11-year-old, it wasn’t only a revelation to me because I now understood how video games worked (though that was definitely important). The real revelation was: this is how the entire universe must work! It’s all just bits getting updated by simple rules. I don’t have to understand physics if I want to understand physics.
Of course I’d heard of quantum effects, and I knew they were supposed to be important — but since I didn’t understand them, they made no difference to me. Then later, as an undergrad at Cornell, I read the early quantum computing papers, and found out that this “quantum weirdness” the physicists kept babbling about was nothing more than linear algebra over the complex numbers. “Hey, linear algebra … even I can do that!”
But I didn’t really become engrossed in quantum computing until a summer internship at Bell Labs. As a diversion from my “real” work that summer (which had to do with multivariate isotone regression), I went through the Bernstein-Vazirani paper, and managed to improve their containment BQP ⊆ P#P to BQP ⊆ PP. Then I found out that Lov Grover worked in the same building as me, so I went and told him about my result. Well, it turned out that BQP ⊆ PP was already known — it had been proved by Adleman, DeMarrais, and Huang the year before. But one consequence of my talking to Lov was that I ended up doing an internship with him the next summer, working (mostly unsuccessfully) on quantum lower bounds. Ashwin Nayak was also working with Lov that summer; from Ashwin I found out about Umesh Vazirani’s group at Berkeley and how all the cool people were there.
After that, the main questions in my mind were whether I could get accepted to Berkeley, whether Umesh would take me on as a student, and whether I was good enough to do anything original in this field. I emailed Umesh and he never responded, which I took as an extremely bad sign — how little I knew back then! Luckily I did get in to Berkeley, I did start working with Umesh, I did stumble on some new results, and I guess the rest is history.
Q: How many people work on the computer science side of quantum computing?
A: Probably the best way to measure that is by how many people attend the annual QIP conference (for if they don’t go to QIP, do they really exist?) Last year’s QIP drew almost 200 attendees.
Q: Would you be willing to supervise grad students in classical theoretical computer science?
A: Willing is an understatement! I would love to supervise talented grad students in derandomization, circuit lower bounds, learning theory, or any of the other classical areas that I try hard to keep up with and occassionally even work on. Admittedly, when it comes to (say) list decoding, extractors, approximation algorithms, or PCP, the students would first have to teach me what’s going on, but after that I’d be happy to supervise them.
Q: What would you say if I told you that I think quantum computing is like postmodern literary criticism, just a way for people to churn out one paper after another by switching words around, citing each other in a circular way, recycling the same few mathematically trivial ideas over and over — and indeed, that the whole field of theoretical computer science has no real ideas and no connections to anything outside itself?

Then either the polynomial hierarchy collapses, or else BQP ⊄ AM (that is, quantum computations can’t be efficiently simulated by Arthur-Merlin protocols).
Proof: Suppose NP ⊆ BQP and BQP ⊆ AM. Then coNP ⊆ BQP ⊆ AM, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the second level by a result of Boppana, Håstad, and Zachos.
Note: If only we could delete the weasel phrase “or else BQP ⊄ AM” from my Most Trivial Theorem, we would’ve achieved a long-sought breakthrough in quantum computing theory. In particular, we would’ve shown that any fast quantum algorithm to solve NP-complete problems would imply an unlikely collapse of classical complexity classes. But while the weasel phrase is weaselly enough to make the Most Trivial Theorem a triviality, I don’t think it’s infinitely weaselly. The reason is my growing suspicion that BQP ⊆ AM in the unrelativized world.

But there have been two developments that, as Planet Earth’s primary D-Wave skepticism clearinghouse, I feel a duty to report.
First, Jason Pontin’s article in the Sunday New York Times has appeared. It’s not perfect, but to get in a description of quantum computing that was even somewhat accurate required a long, word-by-word and phrase-by-phrase battle with the editors of the business section.
Second, Umesh Vazirani sent me a document summarizing the skeptical case against D-Wave, which anyone coming to this blog from the Tech Review or New York Times might find helpful. (Hey, as long as you’re here, stick around for a bit!) I’ve posted Umesh’s criticisms below.
Finally, Happy Easter from all of us here in the shtetl!
Reasons To Be Skeptical About D-Wave’s Claims
by Guest Blogger Umesh Vazirani
1. An Unconvincing Demo: D-wave’s demo consisted of a computer in a box that could solve simple problems. We have no way of knowing whether the computer in the box was an ordinary classical computer or a quantum computer. For the problem the computer solves — finding ground states for 16 bit Ising problems — a classical computer would work just as quickly. This demo is the only public evidence D-wave has presented in support of its claims.
2. A Physics Breakthrough?: Achieving 16 coherent superconducting quantum bits would be quite a breakthrough. Physicists working on superconducting qubits have not been able to achieve more than two coherent quantum bits in the lab. In the absence of evidence from D-Wave that their 16 qubits are coherent, scientists are understandably skeptical. If D-Wave’s qubits are not coherent, as many scientists suspect, their computer would be classical, not quantum. This would still be consistent with the results of the demo, since the decohering qubits would act like classical random bits, and the adiabatic computer would act like a classical computer implementing simulated annealing, which would be quite fast for a small 16 bit Ising problem. It is possible to test the quantum states of D-Wave’s computer for coherence, but Geordie Rose’s statements suggest that no such tests have been made.
3. Claims of Big Algorithmic Breakthrough Without Evidence: 16-bit quantum computers are useless from a practical standpoint because they can only solve very small problems that could just as easily be solved using a classical computer. Thus, D-Wave’s demo, even if it really was a quantum computer, will only be practically useful if the technology will scale to the larger problems that cannot be solved with a classical computer. Unless D-Wave has made a major algorithmic breakthrough as well as a major practical one, however, D-Wave’s computer, even if implemented with thousands of qubits, will not provide a speedup over classical computers. D-Wave does not implement a general purpose quantum computer, only one that can implement adiabatic optimization. They wish to use it to solve the Ising model, which is thought to be beyond the reach of classical computers, but there is no known efficient algorithm for solving the Ising model using this adiabatic approach. It is possible to achieve a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems using adiabatic optimization, but that result requires an ability to tune the rate of the adiabatic process — something which appears to researchers to be extremely hard if not impossible for the Ising problem. Geordie Rose’s public statements suggest that he doesn’t understand this issue, which makes computer scientists skeptical that any breakthrough has been made.
To summarize: For D-Wave to achieve a practically useful quantum computer using their technology, they would have to have made a breakthrough in physics, as well as a breakthrough in the design of their algorithm. Scientists are skeptical both because D-Wave has failed to provide any supporting evidence, and also because their public statements suggest a lack of understanding of the issues involved.
You might ask why researchers are putting so much energy into debunking the D-Wave hype. One reason is that QC researchers feel a responsibility to the public to not overhype quantum computers. Quantum computing is an exciting field that has caught the imagination of the public. This is a good thing. But if the quantum computing effort starts to mingle fact with fiction, then the entire effort loses its credibility.
Another reason is that D-Wave’s unsupported claims are undermining the efforts of the researchers who are working very hard on these problems. It’s as if there was a new biotech company claiming to be at the brink of a revolutionary cure for cancer. If it is true, it is great, but if it’s not, then it undermines the efforts of the legitimate cancer researchers.",4820,"['e377daedc91839369f05274bef5e85df3ae79da6c4dfb4e33a5392c1114ec78e', '6be0aac91ede4d45f1d483581740cecdf9946ebf7f2ca262b872bf02ca1ddd1b', '3297c274ae7e9b6a364a6cfd4c4c5d4382e9a154dfd6414ab1322a84d3843a16', 'd34fee286048aa52900be60fc6597eb07ff91613f10b1c15fac089f70b8d23fc', 'fa3ea73db1e708e37f606a964266d8a83d5631abc19f917782cc857812e975ed', 'c06961123e134e9114c1fa5c7cc5b7f4f4f5002806a5f5575ea64c7e26da69e0', '6874a4af746b15c75e46d6a785940a852ad9a48da86f052502608d5095298ecf', '331a789eac433e2fe885f09ebcabc79c0e40bf8506c3d6433402d1ab44208306', '76ff753c7079feef9871b1beb2ddfbf7bd3c49f6e64a993696a07ac87510b38c', '616cf2fce5f24f411c548b245e7d631e82decff4f289f593ec5b6d71e4eb10f8', '4427b76f7eb9d3a6f4b5d3405e777dcfd293036cb126b3f7328c13ab5d171711', '17e1fb70ed0d12029f9273a6d6c296257173774c52d9cf5bd85646c7bb769171', '69c644ddc33a35dfe3c489a45a82743c783efe2c336e27ff4bf1e6930842281a', 'd71d456c244f18ad835a52e7a9008b14f61abb85ac48444d33ddbb3d5e8309df', 'fed099180d08112581a5b049e643aadb8efa6efd3d0f96b7cce91792ab5715cb', '9857785b5f78e0dde7e86073c6836a755508fb2d05805528f043fafe0d7af35a', '7c3dcf6b040c7893edd92b0bdd9992a5e4385bb2af99106cb35bff9d91262f1a', '6bbadba49f4d5b9224ed6748920f9a3031321ef363516c078b783f1b0aaf9cc1', '94485ed689809afcff478efa146a74e63db33160d5919b036875cb672341edcb', 'e6ac7deba1766f7518e80fc688c3a845dff2d8122f66c9356b674086aec5be68', '813ff82af12ec7cf59c4d1bd88b92f1a87399afcc8621757fa888a51d44dd46f', 'f4f0cb2bd3471d20f284a01c7340234eccf88a7f94a1c2128bb4e4b9185c69c5', '0a463af187ef20095e137b3cdf7fc09cf448bb4bd1f30c30328287844e77cb08', '800d121d91af90cdfaeb39248be9749b242b2d95c275208c437d3172326fa4d6', '59232bad04a17ee2fc84f9258a03f3029ff8039292dbf549eb8bd6313fc7e2dc', '618ea84a2a1c4d93822915cea8bb153356e03f3af009181d2bef8eccd523ded8', 'ce8019601305df5eefc11c132d75ba1a99adce849a2e669889cf07f5050cf670', 'b9dea171fa642fdb1cd5721afc70e9948d7a5f48394660eeca2dbc8c00567e47', '37a9858e93951585e502a2f0448479d704f4c253fd1841977075ea272140c3de', 'd021fe95a816074193f23c8d8eac7360e114806390c427502149173d75215a6a', '83ce98c3a079140a51c47002790e6ddf9eb4fff49ab58a11f4dcd3174e40cbc1', '0d1bea563f6c33da9f500907bddd63e69376420fc6c6406c82935355b4b2db32', '3d5ca83e478beb138aa1a855168e274daabf2b246bf47466e06e936e49ec3b0a', 'a8d8892ef6dd3527de327f6321f2c8fcacd757074922cad44efd9ca3aaeca689', '49b7f7fe56ba16da01f7f72b2b4890200eac8485198585bcba854236745313e4', 'c27560c2a6816a335a101d18f88f0f4890ed3ad4cbc72505980f83750ed4259a', 'ae1c7c2dd6754c8021bba5e844e6c3b4ec06e09c247a0d0e33bdcaeaa3ccf2a8', '79e61f37f4f0d2ef91065eb6ac63f6f9a6e326a509ebb3cdb1840ce6a6e3c077', 'f5ef6257050b54ebac350544bbd10610b47b1602c900509b86b305ab2bc06bda', 'a9542fa849abbb7344c3ee49ecf54d4ffa8a6dfc61b3cadb95aa7a08402c176d', 'f660a6c24ae997788a643cc4c5e9a62a67f0b68d1b51408ea3a1c0f813336b97', '92b34f4f7a8c9f77b67896b4dabfce0602d5a00818db80e4feed71ea47c3abb5', 'fdc29cad25883d86a239abb67fb1c975c4d8992f22f6497b651b9b7672dfc51d']"

Since I come across as pretty harsh on D-Wave in the article, I think it’s worth recalling how we got to this point. When the D-Wave story broke, my first reaction was to give them some benefit of the doubt (as you can see from the mild tone of my “Orion Anti-Hype FAQ”). So what changed? Well, four things:
- I asked Geordie Rose (the founder of D-Wave and sometime commenter on this blog) twice for actual information about the speedup D-Wave claimed to be seeing over classical algorithms, and he never provided any.
- Instead of answering my and others’ technical questions, D-Wave decided to attack academic science itself. Here’s what Herb Martin, the CEO of D-Wave, told an interviewer from ITworld: “Businesses aren’t too fascinated about the details of quantum mechanics, but academics have their own axes to grind. I can assure you that our VCs look at us a lot closer than the government looks at the academics who win research grants.” The track record of companies that engage in this sort of behavior is not good.
- I read article after article claiming that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. I reflected on the fact that a single one of these articles will probably reach more people than every quantum complexity paper ever written.
- It became clear, both from published interviews and from talking to Jason, that D-Wave was doing essentially nothing to correct journalists’ misconceptions about what sorts of problems are believed to be efficiently solvable by quantum computers.
Update (4/6): Geordie Rose has responded to me. A few responses to his response:
- I apologize for getting the CEO’s name wrong. I’d originally written Herb Martin, but then noticed that the ITworld article referred to him as “Ed Martin” and therefore changed it. This seems like another case where D-Wave has to work harder to correct journalists’ misconceptions!
- In a discussion with Geordie on my blog, following my Orion Anti-Hype FAQ, I asked:
You say you’re seeing a speedup in your experiments — but (1) how big of a speedup, and (2) do you mean compared to the best-known classical algorithms (like simulated annealing), or compared to brute-force search?
Then, in another discussion with Geordie following my Speaking truth to parallelism post, I asked him again:
I’m certainly glad that you’re not claiming an exponential speedup. But at least based on the evidence I know about, whether you’re seeing a quadratic speedup — or indeed any asymptotic speedup — is very much open to question. Hence the question I asked you earlier: have you compared the empirical scaling for your adiabatic algorithm to the empirical scaling for the best classical algorithms like simulated annealing? If so, what were the results?
- Geordie now says that “the only way scaling can be extracted is empirically, and we can’t build big enough systems (yet) to answer scaling questions.” Thanks; that’s actually extremely helpful to me. I must have gotten a wrong impression from some of D-Wave’s previous statements. For example, here’s from D-Wave’s recently-released “Introduction to Orion” document (which now seems to be available for “premium subscribers” only):
Q: Are D-Wave processors quantum computers?
A: Yes. We have determined that quantum effects are being harnessed to accelerate computation in our processors.
And here’s from a comment on Dave Bacon’s blog (blog comments seem to be D-Wave’s preferred venue for announcing scientific results):
While the jury is still not in, our studies of these systems seem to indicate that AQCs, in the presence of thermal and spin bath environments, can still provide O(sqrt(N)) scaling even though the central QC system is definitely NOT a “system that’s globally phase coherent over the entire calculation”.
- The core of Geordie’s response is the following paragraph:
This is worth emphasizing, because I thought it was obvious, but it turns out alot of people don’t get this. Most of the poorly thought out comments related to what we’re trying to do have come from theoretical computer scientists, who assume that the things they hold dear are likewise treasured by everyone else. Because they worship efficiency, they have assumed that’s the objective of our projects, when I have repeatedly said it’s not.
When I read this to Umesh Vazirani over the phone, he sardonically replied, “it will be interesting to find out what’s left of this field after you’ve removed the notion of efficiency…”",5073,"['ea9b540b88dd507f0e9009af46549746336b9021719e246f8c7a4876d7ac1ed1', 'f0fe36a3ec9fefd602cfd63e3e0f9a3b478d5bab0454f841972dc0d0186dd6a8', '46d924265457bc6acc66f00b56758634630b78a37a01d03b417f78eb6f624acf', '8abb73a135dd3b69fed2deb426caa587cc6f8a390884da339dcf646798161085', '81bd7e5091420c1f7431fecf05e449fa7456568399d440193fc261a12339c853', 'f01bb9740749c396f600739b6cfad151ce69da515ae74ee557c9b8124f2d7d51', 'b34350411a25c147c89ab5ca13947ade7d450a8035383f4bea5b23d47abf1211', 'ca294b7e2f6f011c176b19c8c35a05c890a1bc71a8f5b0ffc63bea5756812dd1', '95bba8a71a02eae991b0681b9bfbcaf34922891a42c4f83627801ee84ef5952b', '865172fa52d1f6ba90749f94053aab16775ea5177cd417a903a440e6b6708845', '559b6fbebfdaf99ee18be32c40bb637d7df55bba15b85e8a7f57076402702d2b', '894431e1d69f47e8e81003a40199c21b6bc92efaac56eb40ee4373ecea61f710', 'd20cc4c84415a216f0a370e6c7737b2b2967e2a466950f9520941f5433f50212', '2f16110c5fcbe14271ffdf55092a79fdf37101f353b809ab80abc7c56872f3b0', '4576486705305f14b9c21811e7d6535e8ae73088af01b5a74691c1f9b85ad697', 'd6cb7115a8de9b1100dfac95279d247569f733079cf4fdd5668b7b6ea51d7fae', 'a25f706c6cf5f566c5a17f2118956ff88631e627cdad0301fb48fabb6456438f', '0f4261af4e0915f3775281d1a71bc5559524d596aa215eb270fba2a078f10b6d', '7f90be7d9e63278485d33228fd471156fb90df01081e2a81b3c5190e6a0497bd', 'ae41a2cccf32433cf2763287bbf1072ecd9310c1901b3512439a110ae387d7f0', '32c06f84bca14ee30ed0d9f62ac85d7a96ae1e77c0f6710d7df80bde0b0e04fb', '629b6594385fe1fc81f492c0c76658a3c45242152b31f1291bbddf1740178dbe', '4178667d2c5638152c9844a305e18c6833961a5bfd57df819f538e13c3577e53', 'b7daf3a68f3d8600e45d6121489b1f57cd806eb56651c27c7c39adfb526b2667', '15fe96ea70099611c26eb2c86c2edb27197b0cd4e3b03772cb5bd9d680c50d2b', '534581a421785a4351838ef0fcb35d83ee4445d86837e3225a2268ba93856112']"

Granted, I don’t completely solve the mysteries of quantum mechanics in this lecture. I didn’t see any need to — since to judge from the quant-ph arXiv, those mysteries are solved at least twenty times a week. Instead I merely elucidate the mysteries, by examining two very different kinds of stories that people tell themselves to feel better about quantum mechanics: decoherence and hidden variables.
“But along the way,” you’re wondering, “will Scott also touch on the arrow of time, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, Bell’s Inequality, the Kochen-Specker Theorem, the preferred-basis problem, discrete vs. continuous Hilbert spaces, and even the Max-Flow/Min-Cut Theorem?” Man oh man, is someone in for a treat.
I assume that, like Lecture 9, this will be one of the most loved and hated lectures of the course. So bring it on, commenters. You think I can’t handle you?
Update (4/5): Peter Shor just posted a delightful comment that I thought I’d share here, in the hope of provoking more discussion.
Interpretations of quantum mechanics, unlike Gods, are not jealous, and thus it is safe to believe in more than one at the same time. So if the many-worlds interpretation makes it easier to think about the research you’re doing in April, and the Copenhagen interpretation makes it easier to think about the research you’re doing in June, the Copenhagen interpretation is not going to smite you for praying to the many-worlds interpretation. At least I hope it won’t, because otherwise I’m in big trouble.",1629,"['bece31cebf10be3cef551d4ade56ccc7cfad483921d9d204e9a9462b4fe668af',

259,219,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=219,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2007-03-30,Scott Aaronson,"Quantum gravity computation: you, too, can be an expert in this field","I am, I’m slightly embarrassed to admit, quoted pretty extensively in the cover story of this week’s New Scientist magazine (alas, only available to subscribers or those willing to shell out $4.95). The story, by Michael Brooks, is about an interesting recent paper by Lucien Hardy of Perimeter Institute, on the power of “quantum gravity computers.” Lucien’s paper considers the following question: by exploiting quantum fluctuations in the causal structure of spacetime, can one efficiently solve problems that are not efficiently solvable with a garden-variety quantum computer?
As I told Brooks, I really do think this is a hell of a question, one that’s intimately related to the challenge of understanding quantum gravity itself. The trouble is that, until an actual quantum theory of gravity chooses to make itself known to us, almost everything we can say about the question is pure speculation.
But of course, pure speculation is what New Scientist gobbles up with french fries and coleslaw. And so, knowing what kind of story they were going to run, I did my best to advocate giving reality at least a few column inches. Fortunately, the end result isn’t quite as bad as I’d feared.
(Full disclosure: recently New Scientist asked me to write an article for them on theoretical computer science breakthroughs of the last 30 years. Remembering some of the steamers NS has unloaded in the recent past, I faced a moral dilemma for approximately five minutes. I then wrote back to them and said I’d be delighted to do it.)
Anyway, here are a few relevant excerpts from the article. If New Scientist wants me to take these down, then of course I’ll have to comply — though I imagine that being linked to from the 25,000th most popularest blog on the entire Internet could only boost their sales.
A NEW computer is always welcome, isn’t it? It’s always faster than your old one, and it always does more stuff. An upgrade, the latest model with all the bells and whistles is an exciting prospect.
And when it comes to the kind of machine physicists are hoping for, you really are looking at something special. No ordinary upgrade for them: this will be the ultimate computer, and radically different from anything we have ever seen. Not only might it be supremely powerful, defying the logic of cause and effect to give instantaneous answers, it might also tell us exactly how the universe works. It might even tell us how our minds produce the phenomenon we call consciousness. Clear a space on your desk, then, for the quantum gravity computer.
Of course, there’s a chance it may not fit on your desktop because we don’t yet know what the machine will look like. Neither do we know how to build it, or even whether it will do all that its proponents hope. Nevertheless, just thinking about how this processor works could improve our understanding of the universe. “The power of quantum gravity computers is one of the deepest problems in physics,” says Scott Aaronson, a mathematician based at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.
…
Put [quantum theory and general relativity] together to make a quantum theory of gravity and it is almost inevitable that we are going to have trouble with notions of cause and effect: the logic of tock following tick or output following input just won’t apply in the quantum-gravity universe.
…
Aaronson agrees with Hardy. “General relativity says that the causal structure can vary, and quantum mechanics says that anything that can vary can be in superposition,” he says. “So to me, an indefinite causal structure seems like the main new conceptual feature.”
…
The big question is how powerful [a quantum gravity computer] could be: will it be the ultimate processor?
It turns out this is a hard question to answer. Traditionally, a computer’s power is rated by the number of computations it can do in a given time. IBM’s Blue Gene computer currently tops the world rankings for classical computers: it can do 280 trillion calculations per second. In theory, a quantum computer can do even better. It will be able to crack the world’s toughest codes in the blink of an eye.
The quantum gravity computer, on the other hand, can’t compete under these rules because “quickly” doesn’t mean anything in a scheme where space and time can’t be separated. Or, as Aaronson puts it: “It would be nice if the quantum gravity theorists could at least tell us what they mean by ‘time’.”
Nevertheless, Hardy thinks there is good reason to suppose the quantum gravity computer would indeed be a more powerful machine than anything we have so far envisioned. The fact that it might glimpse its results without running a computation hints at this, he says — though he admits this is just speculation.
What’s more convincing, he says, is the difficulty of simulating a quantum gravity computer on a quantum computer. The fact that we have no algorithm for simulating quantum systems on classical computers highlights the gulf between a classical computer and a quantum computer. If a quantum computer cannot simulate a quantum gravity computer, then that implies there might be another huge leap in computing power waiting to be exploited.
…
It is a controversial conclusion, though. Seth Lloyd of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology thinks there is no reason to invoke a discontinuity that separates quantum gravity from more familiar processes … Aaronson’s money is on the Lloyd camp: quantum gravity computers can’t be more powerful than quantum computers, he says. In his view, it is a short step from ultra-powerful quantum gravity computers to total cosmic anarchy. If, as Hardy suggests, a quantum gravity computer might be able to see its result without having to run its algorithms, it is essentially no different to having a quantum computer strapped to a time machine. As we all know, time machines don’t make sense: they would enable us to do things like travel back in history to kill our grandparents and thereby cease to exist. “It’s hard to come up with any plausible way to make quantum computers more powerful that wouldn’t make them absurdly more powerful,” he says.
…
Whatever the truth, this is why investigating the characteristics of the quantum gravity computer is so valuable. It ties theories to the real world, Aaronson says, and stops the important issues, such as a link with observable facts or staying within the bounds of what’s physically possible, from being swept under the carpet. After all, a computer has to produce an observable, measurable output based on an input and a known set of rules. “The connection to observation is no longer a minor detail,” Aaronson says. “It’s the entire problem.”
Two obvious corrections:
- I certainly don’t think that quantum gravity computers “can’t” be more powerful than ordinary quantum computers. What I think is that, at the moment, there’s no good evidence that they would be.
- I am not a mathematician.
Update: Six months ago, New Scientist ran a credulous, uncomprehending story about a rocket propulsion system that flagrantly violates conservation of momentum (!). This led to interesting discussions here, here, and here about what can be done to improve the magazine’s standards. If you enjoyed the D-Wave fiasco, you’ll also like the spectacle of commenters rushing to defend the article against those elitist, ivory-tower academics with their oh-so-sacred conservation laws.

But last week JR Minkel, an editor at Scientific American, asked me to write a brief essay about how quantum algorithms do work, which he could then link to from SciAm‘s website.”OK!” I replied, momentarily forgetting about the quantum algorithm tutorials that are already on the web. So, here’s the task I’ve set for myself: to explain Shor’s algorithm without using a single ket sign, or for that matter any math beyond arithmetic.
Alright, so let’s say you want to break the RSA cryptosystem, in order to rob some banks, read your ex’s email, whatever. We all know that breaking RSA reduces to finding the prime factors of a large integer N. Unfortunately, we also know that “trying all possible divisors in parallel,” and then instantly picking the right one, isn’t going to work. Hundreds of popular magazine articles notwithstanding, trying everything in parallel just isn’t the sort of thing that a quantum computer can do. Sure, in some sense you can “try all possible divisors” — but if you then measure the outcome, you’ll get a random divisor, which almost certainly won’t be the one you want.
What this means is that, if we want a fast quantum factoring algorithm, we’re going to have to exploit some structure in the factoring problem: in other words, some mathematical property of factoring that it doesn’t share with just a generic problem of finding a needle in a haystack.
Fortunately, the factoring problem has oodles of special properties. Here’s one example: if I give you a positive integer, you might not know its prime factorization, but you do know that it has exactly one factorization! By contrast, if I gave you (say) a Sudoku puzzle and asked you to solve it, a priori you’d have no way of knowing whether it had exactly one solution, 200 million solutions, or no solutions at all. Of course, knowing that there’s exactly one needle in a haystack is still not much help in finding the needle! But this uniqueness is a hint that the factoring problem might have other nice mathematical properties lying around for the picking. As it turns out, it does.
The property we’ll exploit is the reducibility of factoring to another problem, called period-finding. OK, time for a brief number theory digression. Let’s look at my favorite sequence of integers since I was about five years old: the powers of two.
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, …
Now let’s look at the powers of 2 “mod 15”: in other words, the remainder when 15 divides each power of 2.
2, 4, 8, 1, 2, 4, 8, 1, 2, 4, …
As you can see, taking the powers of 2 mod 15 gives us a periodic sequence, whose period (i.e., how far you have to go before it starts repeating) is 4. For another example, let’s look at the powers of 2 mod 21:
2, 4, 8, 16, 11, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, …
This time we get a periodic sequence whose period is 6.
You might wonder: is there some general rule from which we could predict the period? Gee, I wonder if mathematicians ever thought of that question…
Well, duh, they did, and there’s a beautiful pattern discovered by Euler in the 1760’s. Let N be a product of two prime numbers, p and q, and consider the sequence
x mod N, x2 mod N, x3 mod N, x4 mod N, …
Then provided x is not divisible by p or q, the above sequence will repeat with some period that evenly divides (p-1)(q-1).
So for example, if N=15, then the prime factors of N are p=3 and q=5, so (p-1)(q-1)=8. And indeed, the period of the sequence was 4, which divides 8. If N=21, then p=3 and q=7, so (p-1)(q-1)=12. And indeed, the period was 6, which divides 12.
Now, I want you to step back and think about what this means. It means that, if we can find the period of the sequence
x mod N, x2 mod N, x3 mod N, x4 mod N, …
then we can learn something about the prime factors of N! In particular, we can learn a divisor of (p-1)(q-1). Now, I’ll admit that’s not as good as learning p and q themselves, but grant me that it’s something. Indeed, it’s more than something: it turns out that if we could learn several random divisors of (p-1)(q-1) (for example, by trying different random values of x), then with high probability we could put those divisors together to learn (p-1)(q-1) itself. And once we knew (p-1)(q-1), we could then use some more little tricks to recover p and q, the prime factors we wanted.
So what’s the fly in the ointment? Well, even though the sequence
x mod N, x2 mod N, x3 mod N, x4 mod N, …
will eventually start repeating itself, the number of steps before it repeats could be almost as large as N itself — and N might have hundreds or thousands of digits! This is why finding the period doesn’t seem to lead to a fast classical factoring algorithm.
Aha, but we have a quantum computer! (Or at least, we’re imagining that we do.) So maybe there’s still hope. In particular, suppose we could create an enormous quantum superposition over all the numbers in our sequence: x mod N, x2 mod N, x3 mod N, etc. Then maybe there’s some quantum operation we could perform on that superposition that would reveal the period.
The key point is that we’re no longer trying to find a needle in an exponentially-large haystack, something we know is hard even for a quantum computer. Instead, we’re now trying to find the period of a sequence, which is a global property of all the numbers in the sequence taken together. And that makes a big difference.
Look: if you think about quantum computing in terms of “parallel universes” (and whether you do or don’t is up to you), there’s no feasible way to detect a single universe that’s different from all the rest. Such a lone voice in the wilderness would be drowned out by the vast number of suburb-dwelling, Dockers-wearing conformist universes. What one can hope to detect, however, is a joint property of all the parallel universes together — a property that can only be revealed by a computation to which all the universes contribute.
(Note: For safety reasons, please don’t explain the above to popular writers of the “quantum computing = exponential parallelism” school. They might shrivel up like vampires exposed to sunlight.)
So, the task before us is not hopeless! But if we want to get this period-finding idea to work, we’ll have to answer two questions:
- Using a quantum computer, can we quickly create a superposition over x mod N, x2 mod N, x3 mod N, and so on?
- Supposing we did create such a superposition, how would we figure out the period?
Let’s tackle the first question first. We can certainly create a superposition over all integers r, from 1 up to N or so. The trouble is, given an r, how do we quickly compute xr mod N? If r was (say) 300 quadrillion, would we have to multiply x by itself 300 quadrillion times? That certainly wouldn’t be fast enough, and fortunately it isn’t necessary. What we can do instead is what’s called repeated squaring. It’s probably easiest just to show an example.
Suppose N=17, x=3, and r=14. Then the first step is to represent r as a sum of powers of 2:
r = 23 + 22 + 21.
Then
Also, notice that we can do all the multiplications mod N, thereby preventing the numbers from growing out of hand at intermediate steps. This yields the result
314 mod 17 = 2.
OK, so we can create a quantum superposition over all pairs of integers of the form (r, xr mod N), where r ranges from 1 up to N or so. But then, given a superposition over all the elements of a periodic sequence, how do we extract the period of the sequence?
Well, we’ve finally come to the heart of the matter — the one part of Shor’s quantum algorithm that actually depends on quantum mechanics. To get the period out, Shor uses something called the quantum Fourier transform, or QFT. My challenge is, how can I explain the QFT to you without using any actual math? Hmmmm…
OK, let me try this. Like many computer scientists, I keep extremely odd hours. You know that famous experiment where they stick people for weeks in a sealed room without clocks or sunlight, and the people gradually shift from a 24-hour day to a 25- or 26- or 28-hour day? Well, that’s just ordinary life for me. One day I’ll wake up at 9am, the next day at 11am, the day after that at 1pm, etc. Indeed, I’ll happily ‘loop all the way around’ if no classes or appointments intervene. (I used to do so all the time at Berkeley.)
Now, here’s my question: let’s say I tell you that I woke up at 5pm this afternoon. From that fact alone, what can you conclude about how long my “day” is: whether I’m on a 25-hour schedule, or a 26.3-hour schedule, or whatever?
The answer, of course, is not much! I mean, it’s a pretty safe bet that I’m not on a 24-hour schedule, since otherwise I’d be waking up in the morning, not 5pm. But almost any other schedule — 25 hours, 26 hours, 28 hours, etc. — will necessarily cause me to “loop all around the clock,” so that it’d be no surprise to see me get up at 5pm on some particular afternoon.
Now, though, I want you to imagine that my bedroom wall is covered with analog clocks. These are very strange clocks: one of them makes a full revolution every 17 hours, one of them every 26 hours, one of them every 24.7 hours, and so on for just about every number of hours you can imagine. (For simplicity, each clock has only an hour hand, no minute hand.) I also want you to imagine that beneath each clock is a posterboard with a thumbtack in it. When I first moved into my apartment, each thumbtack was in the middle of its respective board. But now, whenever I wake up in the “morning,” the first thing I do is to go around my room, and move each thumbtack exactly one inch in the direction that the clock hand above it is pointing.
Now, here’s my new question: by examining the thumbtacks in my room, is it possible to figure out what sort of schedule I’m keeping?
I claim that it is possible. As an example, suppose I was keeping a 26-hour day. Then what would happen to the thumbtack below the 24-hour clock? It’s not hard to see that it would undergo periodic motion: sure, it would drift around a bit, but after every 12 days it would return to the middle of the board where it had started. One morning I’d move the thumbtack an inch in this direction, another morning an inch in that, but eventually all these movements in different directions would cancel each other out.
On the other hand — again supposing I was keeping a 26-hour day — what would happen to the thumback below the 26-hour clock? Here the answer is different. For as far as the 26-hour clock is concerned, I’ve been waking up at exactly the same time each “morning”! Every time I wake up, the 26-hour clock is pointing the same direction as it was the last time I woke up. So I’ll keep moving the thumbtack one more inch in the same direction, until it’s not even on the posterboard at all!
It follows, then, that just by seeing which thumbtack travelled the farthest from its starting point, you could figure out what sort of schedule I was on. In other words, you could infer the “period” of the periodic sequence that is my life.
And that, basically, is the quantum Fourier transform. Well, a little more precisely, the QFT is a linear transformation (indeed a unitary transformation) that maps one vector of complex numbers to another vector of complex numbers. The input vector has a nonzero entry corresponding to every time when I wake up, and zero entries everywhere else. The output vector records the positions of the thumbtacks on the posterboards (which one can think of as points on the complex plane). So what we get, in the end, is a linear transformation that maps a quantum state encoding a periodic sequence, to a quantum state encoding the period of that sequence.
Another way to think about this is in terms of interference. I mean, the key point about quantum mechanics — the thing that makes it different from classical probability theory — is that, whereas probabilities are always nonnegative, amplitudes in quantum mechanics can be positive, negative, or even complex. And because of this, the amplitudes corresponding to different ways of getting a particular answer can “interfere destructively” and cancel each other out.
And that’s exactly what’s going on in Shor’s algorithm. Every “parallel universe” corresponding to an element of the sequence contributes some amplitude to every “parallel universe” corresponding to a possible period of the sequence. The catch is that, for all periods other than the “true” one, these contributions point in different directions and therefore cancel each other out. Only for the “true” period do the contributions from different universes all point in the same direction. And that’s why, when we measure at the end, we’ll find the true period with high probability.",12739,"['318e2701ed51e06663de5680dfd1cb4ad17af429814a61ad04f93b8195bff3b7', 'c9ff0115c6ad03b81ff3e963bd9acf6b81471219530d763af582a8ef9cd54457', '19797cc5513cb47c602f8d07ad4fa3b6d6e3b3eefe0edf948339c41ede4e439c', '6156a2483f3570e4ccdccc200c33b3a0017d4049f85fee78cd6529f348b3611c', '42aeceb123a7d5a7cce54d6af9e8280cfaef93d6ba05b9285d51f91036dabddf', 'a190a6bfeb6485db28fb9d81a0b035b4041f7b948f1f42a0ae41ca72011d2437', '77023b4727f6379c15e77d2407ec97e512a42613437066e6cd2df05c0cf5dbe3', 'fdc01e3b9b26af6f744358747550e8524148d2a2cd49dd0517e3608c20f121b1', '3eff885bbce74d4891320bd6b6b94e6b0c6dcb4d27006594aa5e7765ce15643b', 'a4730dbd0e6bf9f103a5182004f092be6cebdc620d3cfa0fa4202dd12db4b5c1', 'a08bc5e752384efed9af6833837a16882121bde0567a01f9369c2152bebcb764', '7f304ce3587c309b60fa5e72850c541d362246c681a2d298fdced277e5fb88a5', '9ef023bb53f842f38bc982c7d906fa571c8f1293a244e059125cec51b5ecf3e6', '79515481b6b274fbcea9830cb02942a6e24fda2e8f3f55fb71723b4928bf050c', 'fffc923796b942e5713ebafd49e5dcd4a639d6ca3b92144ea7faf81838440557', '5f50806eede7f472d6ab43a963615e303954b459ea1b6e982e503440a82a6686', 'c77b2d9e20e92c5e3531507d834feb62dfbbfb1e99dabb3fff0f48b82bdbf78c', '89bacfd0a70950425bdbd95d50d9984245c38e630f3758f7e11c36de91b04a65', 'a16d3ed4ae66c008caf53e0022045f9b93b1e6dd87def58d7acfa1f4dd250383', '7113581fd9802bd252b2aefb420da02521b501b55440aec82b8d56bde339bf3e', '10d462f8ab8bf743eb2530bd8133fb6a467381135b938d04828a068031056279', 'd331b84ead1d16ace0bd14edd31f987bc88184afe54af61658b865f2d8f6990e', 'b0353f9632544ba8ab2f1ef4581949698a31a3d0a2357a7dd0e63d687e645fda', '7bfba98784891028a98be8b6c260acda7cfeebd9c317dc8c0887e841a6f2339d', '192405fce9d9cc232e03aec806f8c939c08b9b1d8d0c77e87a7cdd74c0057be2', '23761ab5129d886ad7ddf0622d1a39f1bc64ec0f292c3e5b7a27dce15d63ba8f', '1029a3033b90aeabb0d98780004ee56ff60862d962c5cfe2e6f3e8bb69a5731e', 'f2db7b45be7f3808c132610a2b713ae0774c4ee0f411722d16dcaafb38fadae4', '392ce84dd2ba8a1a24c36f4f1b60994bc9b6b182c65a5655a8056f6a3e6081fc', '2f5cc32ee7b53b9a617be7a550c0ae03dccbc32658ca2d04d7ecc391698446b5', 'ecca29cc08e97af44bc79e92cf5bb0d56207b3152fc921a8ffe07ec2d72a3749', '9461449f7707d8b5e771b5435bfa416e264bc251565dd7c0e29e23328e03f2a6', '4ed3374d7a27d477044887af85fce3ea9fea434b76ec7fd7c68131591bab4ff0', '908f651bd612cdc3e63d8096942c11c65e7e7b4901af88367132f0bfc3a845f9', 'e18748bc149280365a3a3c705d07de28e5279a7defb598dfb0ba45960f041172', 'bd4191f8bef75347e20477d0fff3c956fc71340533e9bfa3750245581462cb09', 'd8025818c8348cf69721a716f4aa0a29aaa26393978806cdb246a1e9d53b6fd8', 'c876281458890268d214023bed961b13de93c974ac753f532ff78b53f04b35e8', 'f9443a4ef9759032247a4d3c2454e59dae6db2c119f228d25c386c563974851a', '6eb9c15afa6b9ff9d4d0fe5910981fa15bc96e7a118d4479e3798db80dd8d2d8', '70010b50ffcfa00fd1040e46d7b1197d315b22c99213e1d2af9326a9066b27d6', 'a5b65719116945a442461d55208d09fe82ff7f2b3c0c354bc0a8de9148f67a1d', 'f2cfdd17eaf333b14aa32f4e8881f4eafc8d0b01fd6e07c954c503298bbb82e9', '4b60b18a0b7904f255f28c8152b75e78994d39e25185527c49ab8e0c6b9d2c74', '529aad444cf813f4862accf55498e0f339740f4e9c6dc76cbe08db5db469fcb5', '4215e73bd3cbbcd8ebc6646374753609842aa29a9c593e75284837b1488e534f', '7a95df72ea61894d7ceb32ba82c731dd785b3a0954fe4c83513be07e23d47196', '099eb41b44050396342c5d0c05257c9fbbc2efbc19f680ea26d64bc470798d1e', 'c53e07d6edfb1e98943005db1823e36930eea24f1b46e3f46405008ae5eb37ff', '0b023d49c5d95c91c2b79b2f49a7ecdff815f24107f3404f4e1debfde9df3066', 'ca06e62c7d98ca8757eabc73fc1a499cf443b75ba942536f06f1cc987a0d3380', '5810805e320acba9aedb5f8c3da195f3c677941cc163e21670c471bed7af954e', '7816b74a8ccb0160efc7db8af83fc81605f060f1408f01d975ee974594cf33d9', '88fb3ec9c3ab95439a879019158ed7ebf0ed0bca3a89c4e908fbdf4d866ff601', '1bc6ff9a0c7b5238355b6a2cfe54310626b6be569fd2585e40ffae1165db0a06', '0bbf84d3c812b62106cceed75b60ee09b536c1316e1862cf335b605ff932a1ce', 'edabedfdf65c8a86f3d86500c1195dd698d544bd712876507d8eeeab0698d4f2', 'c03612e10f3a3616286e789f02e8e6a814a71ed1f5f1409680f1721408a85a64', '8184c4e25b33a04b0d854d6495224528f372b4928a8fffceb0d81652fba559eb', '73fe710cb26fd4ea8f87fe9c38b3b672560106a7f7f7ca0e991c7cff6651ab06', '39d653743877674c491eb2d5ef0774e60b0df8463d336377095a45ea6cfa9ac0', 'e171236ea716de0786d7480cdf0f85dfe31832711ad871bdff9c9f059a675d19']"
262,207,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=207,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2007-02-23,Scott Aaronson,NAND now for something completely different,"There was a real breakthrough in quantum algorithms last week — though you wouldn’t have known about it from reading Slashdot, Yahoo News, The Economist, or (for that matter) this blog.
Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann — the feared MIT trio — announced a quantum algorithm for evaluating NAND trees in O(√N) time. This solves a problem that I worked on as an undergrad nine years ago (!), and that many a tyro had unsuccessfully tackled since.
Alright, so suppose we’ve got this ant at the root of a complete binary tree:
You and your friend take turns moving the ant: first you can move it either down-and-left or down-and-right, then your friend can make the same choice, then you, etc. If the ant ends up at a sugar cube, you win the game; if it ends up at a boot, your friend wins. (Your friend is an exterminator.)
In the above example, it’s not hard to see that you’re the one with a winning strategy. But more generally, we can imagine a tree d levels deep, with an arbitrary sequence of N=2d boots and sugar cubes at the leaf vertices. Then the question is: how many of the leaf vertices do you have to examine, in order to decide whether you or your friend has the win?
The goal here is to model games of alternation like chess and go, abstracting away the details. The boots and sugar cubes correspond to losing and winning board positions. Then we want to know: how many board positions would a computer have to evaluate, in order to play the game perfectly?
It’s clear that you generally don’t have to examine all the positions. For example, suppose that at some position where it’s your turn to move, you discover a move that always lets you win. Then you don’t care what happens if you make any other move from that position.
Based on this idea (which AI types call alpha-beta pruning), in 1986 Saks and Wigderson gave a randomized algorithm to find an optimal move in the ant game, after examining (on average) only N0.753 of the N leaf vertices. (Here 0.753 ≈ log2(1+√33)-2.) On the other hand, they also showed that this running time was optimal for randomized algorithms with no error. Then, in 1995, Santha showed that it was optimal even for randomized algorithms with error.
Alright, but what about the quantum case? It was observed early on (by a simple reduction from the PARITY problem) that any quantum algorithm for playing the ant game would have to examine at least √N of the N leaf vertices. But was a √N running time achievable? Until last week, we knew of no quantum algorithm that did even slightly better than the classical bound of N0.753.
And now it’s time to eat some crow: I didn’t believe there was such a quantum algorithm. I thought N0.753 was optimal. In my defense, though, this was never really a very serious belief, in contrast to (say) my belief that quantum computers can’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. Really I only claimed N0.753 was optimal to try and goad people into proving me wrong. And today, I’m pleased to report that my strategy was successful.
Last Wednesday, Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann put out a preprint showing how to find an optimal move for the ant game in time O(√(N log N)). However, their algorithm only worked in the “Hamiltonian oracle model,” a fanciful idealization preferred by physicists in which time is (get this) continuous rather than discrete. Two days later, Childs, Cleve, Jordan, and Yeung showed how to port the algorithm to the ordinary discrete model, except that there the running time goes up to N1/2+ε for any ε>0. Then, just yesterday, Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann improved the running time in the Hamiltonian oracle model to the optimal O(√N). One hopes and expects that further improvements in the discrete model are forthcoming.
Another obvious question is whether any game tree can be evaluated in O(√N) time, not just the complete binary tree used in the ant game. Since the complete binary tree was previously considered the “hardest” case, the natural conjecture would be yes.
Years ago, David Deutsch gave an interview in which he illustrated Grover’s algorithm using chess. I emailed Deutsch to point out that this was a bad example: at the time, we we had no idea how to get a Grover speedup for games of alternation with small branching factor. Deutsch dutifully posted a correction. Now I guess I’ll have to email him again, to tell him one can get a “Grover” speedup for games like chess after all.
I put “Grover” in quotes because, even though the Farhi-Goldstone-Gutmann algorithm achieves a square-root speedup, it doesn’t actually look anything like Grover’s algorithm. Instead it’s based on a quantum walk (reminiscent of this paper), which is analyzed using tools from scattering theory. Apparently, physics occasionally does come in handy for quantum computing.
All in all, this business with NAND trees has only confirmed my core belief about theoretical computer science: that there are no miracles, except when there are.",4951,"['ec0d2b3ef3b2526f29ea0c808a5179ba50dc8cd7ceee32d36c30ab21d65b351b', '0567edba8507d06910dba9a1c758501730d9dea1f93b5365f3a53acf23fd8728', 'ec7b7604e40bee8472cf91e4e7897c71679a86d0ae16d7629cb6fd6fe9150a6d', 'efa854f9d52fb61363c501189dfd402f7db880483218b8665520b58cd3e64b60', 'b68e3e3896e1769c047e191da38ae53cc3e0c3a682f664de030a543c36f4b8b4', '1f677b9703d1f6db88494324a018163109e2758ef22177ae4eb796e677a8918a', 'f30c0da55832e0ad7395dbb83dc17e732f8c5b5b58db469cca769b304b7381ac', '65cc0edd01cdf07faaf1ed1f756409f8cc08b3660af0b9efbb71fcc1d4d22fe9', '5aa3d0c468f43cf46ca5131a2c043bd158c30e543d9260633f34aec706e3c4a8', '4315dbb76aa39d3cc39db6d9fc3aa0dc535ebb0015d4a6fa33b8f53a106927cd', 'd30590771c75edb4db6ab27a5e5bfa48aafd744074b1c96448e0f6852c689e8f', '508fc86a0de94e83870a285f21148b472337f0aea88baf427e17f73291bbe738', '8f9019218490b2ec02d56bd2829dd56adc8c9e247fdfc7728428e46b0dead67c', 'b6e46ceb5b407a7b6726c3cce7861cdccaf4762d81e5edf6e4a8adbe0de2ab97', '898960e16bfb37a3f3048709fd1442c13094206aeb0dc1308dc1e9a90ba10b73', 'eded0818cce58e84c825a6d478ebaaaa383d56cff3d8ac9cb04cdde3736944c7', '992d41674b0b83e82975f81ae4630d4816474e0d452666a1b60e3f3717ad4ba8', 'b195440e8845533ff516792d32433360352219bd8dfe207d17f1b7c126fd855b', '5715c99ba2613ad610ff9b3a3a11d108736cc8c09990d2c29339c326e70fdfe8', '468c7e4e007224246e7d8363c907b1f5831332d8b609ccb6be6b1d0a0fe750ed', 'e33e006c374948d9342979aaa968bff651ab9a7c142b4bb5aa8039febc1f917a', '2a20c615624011e61ba099b0e573498c7bb583990a9d8174324735d5032ce49d', '00b70eb90f98e313651ad75f0664f5783e178e3c64fc2004d0e2c6e9e26f5a4f', '2aaacbf1f320453667b4e1b5b83a105e1c49887fb71f054995b2e4264cff5945', '5b2cebd68afc7209c31a0c0513f1c8d09390620d46e78af284a9a4136b52a0a1']"
263,206,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=206,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2007-02-21,Scott Aaronson,A complexity theorist’s (non)apology,"Several respected physicists wrote to me privately to say how disappointed they were that Umesh and I would fight shoddy journalism by making a shoddy claim of our own: namely, that the inability of quantum computers to solve NP-complete problems efficiently is an established fact. I took a lot of flak in the comments section over the same issue.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I will answer the unjust charges being leveled against me and my advisor.
But first, let’s review the facts. As I’ve said in pretty much every introductory talk I’ve ever given, obviously we can’t yet hope to prove that NP-complete problems are hard for quantum computers, since we haven’t even proved they’re hard for classical computers! (Nor, for that matter, do we have any idea how to prove that if they’re hard for classical computers then they’re also hard for quantum computers.) These are some of the most profound open problems in mathematics. Solving them could easily take decades or centuries.
I dare say that Umesh and I know this as well as anyone on Earth. And that’s why, even while trying in the space of a few sentences to correct a breathtaking misconception about the nature of the physical world that was being endlessly repeated to millions of people, we still took care in what we said.
Here’s Umesh:
Most egregious is your assertion that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in “one shot” by exploring exponentially many solutions at once. This mistaken view was put to rest in the infancy of quantum computation over a decade ago … For unstructured search problems like the NP-complete problems this means that there is no exponential speed up but rather at most a quadratic speed up.
In the above passage, Umesh is talking about an epochal theorem that he and others did manage to prove: namely, that quantum computers could not solve NP-complete problems by any “one-shot” method based on exploring exponentially many solutions in parallel. Throw away the structure of an NP-complete problem — consider it just as an abstract space of 2n solutions — and we know that quantum computers will give you at most a quadratic speedup over classical ones.
In the thirteen years since this “BBBV theorem” was proved, two interesting things happened:
- Various experts dismissed the theorem as irrelevant, knocking down a straw man, stacking the deck in favor of its conclusion by imposing an utterly-unjustified “black-box” assumption, etc.
- Hundreds of articles appeared, in both the popular press and the arXiv, that directly contradicted the theorem.
It reminds me of how theologians chide Richard Dawkins for refuting only a crude, anthropomorphic, straw-man god instead of a sophisticated Einsteinian one, and then (with an air of self-satisfaction) go off and pray to the crude god.
To be fair, we do have one quantum algorithm for NP-complete problems that falls outside the scope of the BBBV theorem: namely, the adiabatic algorithm of Farhi et al. This algorithm can be seen as a quantum version of simulated annealing. Intriguingly, Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann gave examples where simulated annealing gets stuck at local optima, whereas the adiabatic algorithm tunnels through to the global optimum. On the other hand, van Dam, Mosca, and Vazirani gave other examples where the adiabatic algorithm also gets stuck at local optima, taking exponential time to reach a global optimum.
The upshot is that, if a fast quantum algorithm for NP-complete problems existed, then just like a fast classical algorithm, it would have to be radically different from anything that’s yet been imagined. Because of this — not to mention the civilization-changing consequences that such an algorithm would have — Umesh and I feel strongly that claims to solve NP-complete problems should never be bandied about lightly. As with perpetual-motion machines or antigravity shields, the burden of proof lies entirely with the would-be inventor. “In case of fire, break glass.” “In case of algorithm, break skepticism.”
It might be objected that, while the experts know that this is what Umesh meant, laypeople could easily misinterpret his words — or in other words, that Umesh has pulled a D-Wave of his own. But here’s the crucial difference. Any motivated reader who wanted the real story behind Umesh’s three-sentence caricature could find that story in peer-reviewed articles only a Google search away. But with D-Wave, all they’d have to go on is the PR. Simplifying mathematical subtleties is a right you have to earn, by having the cards in case anyone calls your bluff.
So much for Umesh’s letter. Now let’s look at mine:
Today it is accepted that quantum computers could not solve NP-complete problems in a reasonable amount of time. Indeed, the view of quantum computers as able to “try all possible solutions in parallel,” and then instantly choose the correct one, is fundamentally mistaken.
Notice I didn’t say it was proved that quantum computers can’t solve NP-complete problems in reasonable time: I said it was accepted. This, I felt, was a difference few people would have trouble understanding. As an example, if biologists said it was accepted that the Loch Ness monster doesn’t exist, presumably no one would interpret that as meaning they’d actually proved its nonexistence. Indeed, the interesting difference between the two cases is that someday, it might actually be possible to prove the nonexistence of the fast quantum algorithm.
Or are we complexity theorists being too dogmatic? Should we concede to a certain subset of our physicist friends that, until an actual proof has been discovered, we have no basis even to guess whether P versus NP or NP versus BQP will go one way or the other way? Should we, in other words, hold ourselves to the same lofty standards of uncompromising mathematical rigor that the physicists themselves have always adhered to?
Oh — pardon me. I had momentarily forgotten that we were talking about the headmasters of handwaving, the sultans of sloppiness, the princes of proof-by-example. Indeed, I think it’s fair to say that if physicists had discovered the P versus NP question, they would have immediately declared that P≠NP — and they would have hailed this ‘discovery’ of theirs as another remarkable success for physics as a discipline. And everyone else — from other scientists to programmers to journalists to the general public — would have gone right along with it. The task of proving P≠NP would have been left as a technical detail, to be filled in by the mathematical hairsplitters — just like the task of proving quark confinement, or the ergodicity of particles in a box, or the existence of Yang-Mills theory, or the perturbative finiteness of string theory.
Clearly, the issue here can’t be the intelligence of physicists, some of whom actually seem reasonably smart. The issue, rather, is their different standard — much closer to the standard of everyday life — for saying that they know something is true. My favorite example in this vein comes from Leonid Levin, who tells me he couldn’t convince Richard Feynman that P versus NP was an open problem at all.
I believe Feynman was onto something, in that the only reason P versus NP is called an “open problem” is that we — the theoretical computer scientists and mathematicians — hold ourselves to a different standard of rigor than any other scientists. Were we less cautious, we could easily talk about the hardness of NP-complete problems as one of our great discoveries, a discovery for which working out the mathematical underpinnings admittedly remains as a challenge for future generations.
Ironically, our higher standard of rigor often gets turned against us, when outsiders use it to argue that we’re just guessing, or building castles in the sky, or making conjectures that could all turn out to be wrong. The same charges could obviously be leveled against the central hypotheses of physics or economics or pretty much any other field, but they rarely are — at least not by the same people.
I’m tired of double standards, is all I’m saying.",8087,"['dae6cc56a39bacb7f366f6cd8aea4f42ed92c4e09667a121d2c15eb606a29ea4', '162bac32e4e074f02e0e76edbb9c8cf62840df15eb5e38df5b5183a036cfeec8',

Most egregious is your assertion that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in “one shot” by exploring exponentially many solutions at once. This mistaken view was put to rest in the infancy of quantum computation over a decade ago when it was established that the axioms of quantum physics severely restrict the type of information accessible during a measurement. For unstructured search problems like the NP-complete problems this means that there is no exponential speed up but rather at most a quadratic speed up.
Your assertions about D-Wave are equally specious. A 16 qubit quantum computer has smaller processing power than a cell phone and hardly represents a practical breakthrough. Any claims about D-Wave’s accomplishments must therefore rest on their ability to increase the number of qubits by a couple of orders of magnitude while maintaining the fragile quantum states of the qubits. Unfortunately D-Wave, by their own admission, have not tested whether the qubits in their current implementation are in a coherent quantum state. So it is quite a stretch to assert that they have a working quantum computer let alone one that potentially scales. An even bleaker picture emerges when one more closely examines their algorithmic approach. Their claimed speedup over classical algorithms appears to be based on a misunderstanding of a paper my colleagues van Dam, Mosca and I wrote on “The power of adiabatic quantum computing”. That speed up unfortunately does not hold in the setting at hand, and therefore D-Wave’s “quantum computer” even if it turns out to be a true quantum computer, and even if it can be scaled to thousands of qubits, would likely not be more powerful than a cell phone.

At first I merely got angry — but then I asked myself what Winston Churchill, Carl Sagan, or Chip ‘n Dale’s Rescue Rangers would do. So let’s see if The Economist prints the following.
SIR —
In a remarkably uncritical article about D-Wave’s announcement of the “world’s first practical quantum computer” (Feb. 15), you gush that “[i]n principle, by putting a set of entangled qubits into a suitably tuned magnetic field, the optimal solution to a given NP-complete problem can be found in one shot.” This is simply incorrect. Today it is accepted that quantum computers could not solve NP-complete problems in a reasonable amount of time. Indeed, the view of quantum computers as able to “try all possible solutions in parallel,” and then instantly choose the correct one, is fundamentally mistaken. Since measurement outcomes in quantum mechanics are random, one can only achieve a computational speedup by carefully exploiting the phenomenon known as quantum interference. And while it is known how to use interference to achieve dramatic speedups for a few problems — such as factorising large integers, and thereby breaking certain cryptographic codes — those problems are much more specialised than the NP-complete problems.
Over the past few days, many news outlets have shown a depressing willingness to reprint D-Wave’s marketing hype, without even attempting to learn why most quantum computing researchers are sceptical. I expected better from The Economist.

I thought ‘factorising,’ ‘specialised,’ and ‘sceptical’ were a nice touch.
A Final Thought (2/16): As depressing as it is to see a lazy magazine writer, with a single harebrained sentence, cancel out your entire life’s work twenty times over, some good may yet come from this travesty. Where before I was reticent in the war against ignorant misunderstandings of quantum computing, now I have been radicalized — much as 9/11 radicalized Richard Dawkins in his war against religion. We, the quantum complexity theorists, are far from helpless in this fight. We, too, can launch a public relations campaign. We can speak truth to parallelism. So doofuses of the world: next time you excrete the words “NP-complete,” “solve,” and “instantaneous” anywhere near one another, brace yourselves for a Bennett-Bernstein-Brassard-Blitzirani the likes of which the multiverse has never seen.
Update (2/16): If you read the comments, Geordie Rose responds to me, and I respond to his response.

Q: Thanks to D-Wave Systems — a startup company that’s been in the news lately for its soon-to-be-unveiled “Orion” quantum computer — is humanity now on the verge of being able to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time?
A: No. We’re also not on the verge of being able to build perpetual-motion machines or travel faster than light.
Q: But couldn’t quantum computers try all possible solutions in parallel, and thereby solve NP-complete problems in a heartbeat?
A: Yes, if the heart in question was beating exponentially slowly.
Otherwise, no. Contrary to widespread misconception, a quantum computer could not “try all possible solutions in parallel” in the sense most people mean by this. In particular, while quantum computers would apparently provide dramatic speedups for a few “structured” problems (such as factoring integers and simulating physical systems), it’s conjectured that they couldn’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time.
Q: But isn’t factoring an NP-complete problem?
A: Good heavens, no! While factoring is believed to be intractable for classical computers, it’s not NP-complete, unless some exceedingly unlikely things happen in complexity theory. Where did you get the idea that factoring was NP-complete? (Now I know how Richard Dawkins must feel when someone asks him to explain, again, how “life could have arisen by chance.”)
Q: How could the people at D-Wave not understand that quantum computers couldn’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time?
A: To his credit, Geordie Rose (the founder of D-Wave) does understand this; see here for example. And yet, essentially every article I’ve read about D-Wave gives readers exactly the opposite impression. The charitable explanation is that the D-Wave folks are being selectively quoted or misquoted by journalists seeking to out-doofus one another. If so, one hopes that D-Wave will try harder in the future to avoid misunderstandings.
Q: But even if it gave only polynomial speedups (as opposed to exponential ones), couldn’t the adiabatic quantum computer that D-Wave built still be useful for industrial optimization problems?
A: D-Wave’s current machine is said to have sixteen qubits. Even assuming it worked perfectly, with no decoherence or error, a sixteen-qubit quantum computer would be about as useful for industrial optimization problems as a roast-beef sandwich.
Q: But even if it wasn’t practically useful, wouldn’t a 16-qubit superconducting quantum computer still be a major scientific advance?
A: Yes, absolutely.
Q: So, can D-Wave be said to have achieved that goal?
A: As Dave Bacon pointed out earlier, it’s impossible to answer that question without knowing more about how their machine works. With sixteen qubits, a “working demo” doesn’t prove anything. The real questions are: how high are the fidelities, and what are the prospects for scalability?
Q: But clearly D-Wave isn’t going to give away its precious trade secrets just to satisfy some niggling academics! Short of providing technical specifics, what else could they do to make computer scientists take them seriously?

The system we are currently deploying, which we call Trinity, is a capability-class supercomputer specifically designed to provide extremely rapid and accurate approximate answers to arbitrarily large NP-complete problems … Trinity has a front-end software interface, implemented in a combination of Java and C, that allows a user to easily state any NP-complete problem of interest. After such a problem has been stated the problem is compiled down to the machine language of the processors at the heart of the machine. These processors then provide an answer, which is shuttled back to the front end and provided to the user. This capability can of course be called remotely and/or as a subroutine of some other piece of software.
Or to translate: “Not only have we built a spaceship capable of reaching Pluto in a few hours, our spaceship also has tinted windows and deluxe leather seats!” If I were them, I’d focus more on the evidence for their core technological claims, given that those claims are very much what’s at issue.
Q: While Dave Bacon also expressed serious doubts about the Orion quantum computer, he seemed more enthusiastic than you are. Why?
A: Generous and optimistic by nature, Dave strives to give others the benefit of the doubt (as the Chinese restaurant placemat would put it). Furthermore, as Quantum Pontiff, he’s professionally obligated to love the quantum sinner and forgive the wayward quantum sheep. And these are all wonderful qualities to have. On the other hand, when the hype surrounding some topic crosses a certain threshold, arguably a pricklier approach becomes called for.
Q: If D-Wave fizzles out, will many journalists and policymakers then conclude that quantum computing is bunk?
A: It doesn’t seem unlikely.
Q: What would it take to get these people to recognize the most elementary distinctions?
A: That’s the question, isn’t it?
Update (2/13): Lawrence Ip, my friend from Berkeley who now works at Google, went to the D-Wave “launch” in person and kindly provided the following report.
I just came back from the D-Wave announcement. Unfortunately I had to leave at the start of the Q&A session.
Here’s what I took away from it (minus the marketing fluff):
– They claim to solve integer programming problems on their system. Geordie Rose was careful to explicitly say that they are only hoping to see a quadratic speedup. Herb Martin (the CEO) wasn’t quite as careful in his opening remarks but then he’s the “suit”. Geordie said that their current chip is not a universal QC (presumably because their space of Hamiltonians is limited) but with some work they expect to be able to make it universal.
– Geordie said compared their approach to the efforts in academia as similar to Celera and the Human Genome Project. He said they were trying to get something that would scale fast and worry about about the quality of the qubits later. He contrasted this to the academic community’s efforts to achieve fine control over qubits before scaling up. They say that they hope to reach 1024 qubits by the end of 2008.
– They demoed 3 “real-world” problems where they used their system as essentially a blackbox IP solver.
– Searching for protein matches. Given a protein try to find the closest match in a protein database. They serially fed all the items from the database to the chip and asked it to score the match against the given protein. They said it was solving a maximum independent set problem.
– Finding the best seating arrangement at a wedding reception. Given constraints on which people can’t be seated together and who wants to sit together, find the optimal arrangement.
– Solving a Sudoku puzzle.
– At one point Geordie quoted you. He excerpted a paragraph from your SIGACT article (the one where you talk about generating Shakespeare’s 38th play) and mentioned your proposal of the inability to solve NP-hard problems as a physical law. As far as I can remember, the only other computer scientist he quoted was Gordon Moore so you’re in good company. 🙂",7786,"['b03d8133e23e80b33aa4f3d1eab5f1037f4bc4236376bf40e15638d0262fea20', '52b5e933d669e07a365de3a71fbdf9f73b11abe322a341c94838ca3ca1a0bc8a', '742765bf2905d60c499b7d70306a7a5ed28764b905f34037e72a06bc48c06fa3', 'f937fc5a0186c1b0705669815cd3fe9e0062d9fb5465e94aeaf688d1d4243033', '1321288eb5174fed197c4b9e22269d3541e8c62d5dfa354ffc7b8d7f1cd395bc', '22f016abce8582e745c6ee38c4c9ef24716822bd8937c51d89076426735f4fdc', '9cae73f02fa384be87287701a2294cc9aadcc7d0285bc42d4fa7bcd33daac8af', '561778916e77e641b3b2607d4ccecd67f4151bc89c45de325f7fe28e960cfc13', 'de5260db5d9e7438cd9f5050f6dc4e18038da4552c1037e363dd4c8197f8ba7f', '9ce2c08b40fbe8dd85eb56cdc6bbc95a6ce38c196af175f2b73835f18dc6e483', '3678cb1408c2ff6a1cc6737570045b23eba54a0dc817813da0dc13b63ef36068', '004fac4b072cf97a0e42c1f2510cc636503e428d43fcac8d4090b6ed2c5efc91', 'c9deaac753a7aa94767e03e7b4d452902dae8ed26d7a0a2a8ed5e087aff87f37', 'df5bfd9616e1d8b2a76f22f6f2acd3c8131e41e94193e4a842e743c366bd611d', '61136f71bae6cb41c474429e4ad43388c4de4ccffba06784ad9f403fb78c847c', '959db0d65df002de54c5227e122020bc4fd4e244fb352d6c8d947e0f067ea991', '063f71b74d8b4315d409caaa03342f641fb7b7c62033584ae6b1bd8796d5ca62', 'e29eaef6a0fdbda6a6886f2f096f7b63778a55f387d1298f0457357ffdba0200', '70e7de787430f983b0d4ee49e658a6e82841568f1d7f4eb76ea7345f43c3b644', '17cf6bf751fcb573b84489d1e754c6b2b2c60e617bb8be2434f45414f23c6d29', '37d466882f1e4e5492f6c872ade0aa2081eca9eb88c4546f0753cc0d2b23aecc', '1b7641ed3d8169a54f3b3714587b9669d133a88552dd287187e417825c6666d4', '2aa1427ed3b9338332d64150e89b53ca2d73c4d5087fdc02d52cf6b969dd3383', '6869d29ee5533693a1e611a0aeb4fb26f8baf2da56f28edfa7bf300c9bb0e901', '8fac28020b3e7628fa9f470df9a5d45ed5d1c0ac21a85f7a15385c7dc00c8542', 'e1f96da894d659244fe8507e726c3a919f1214e0bb30ee148d9ee52468d57bc8', 'e2e9d745951fbf342e7472b2b725c8cce139a7afcd1fc045e4bd45ff938fea30', 'c714d7326be03f15ee997c30bd9a00b26c46a68242d17b7dc2ad2d0bf0df555a', 'f384236304d967e90783ff513afc95329060abae0394461891d494544d615e4a', 'e128c0b88418bfa181442da819811b91d1074d2de509c47ff4d092b128a554d9', '024aeb3e925efa06db352358eed5cdd3a44a1db641aad9420139880b59095911', 'd240ccb50d11c7bd07ca2c0bf8810e4388df39da6947bc9cebd5018263e2e54a', 'feae6761af7850a26ee45ee114a11636a75a87d13c1885b1b1f439fe40ca5061', '18ee52fc0ad83632612eda9af21a87b697c8a3adf326caaeac6fe8f6f1389946', '72fa75376511652360c04c93057d2cec064c3f5c426ea4d3a473057d12065630', '7762a1da1b50f305333edd41f9c74c785373702f234735543914e1fde9a10f64', 'ae7f4b3ef407c8f6e698dfcceebd4b1e09aac8b07071546406b39cf6d78b8f9d', '08d20c90ac0359e260b14c19b8acc2e22fa9d06b9111a0807a255c131c7abfb1', '0d927a85003adf3a4b399ce0d7e1f781d8742d7d429064f42ae416c1cbe34fc7', '0640837583fc1a8e9db00ee903562853dd97a0b3dfc976502ecb82278720302c', '0ba6e95249cac3ea6abbe90c5224f56f113ef0a94e9f86529845ce77f35696c3', 'ddfe8fec86f4ed166df4c967d521bbb273fdaac06be1219ce2121fbd56ea68b8', '6887e49efd760512b890025bed39ed4e961b09b4b2b09563aaa676f7bbfe66a5', '89e97e30118aa0d3b95d7b4ece15240f24cef82c4e50f013a70750a9bf9e0291', '612bc4dd2a3b81fd4d4cb0b7d2a65a403a7661e9a43d2ca125984b6d913e4f03', '71aeba9243345ee552964bd3a79a5687682be4997c16d3a38dbbc869cfd6fc82', '885cd800971957f788691bddeb9aa071ab6409777ece98f10a43fef15029a126', 'ab27bab2320c8041955fbbd057e011b81a5610f8d81c78baee716d81cd99ac2e', '4f0d41a14d79e60fca898253f91ebf21e439129c3142580a089fd587e9428b7d', '389b956ba41f612e3a3d9bdebf80211f27baceea5fe071fdfa3d970e8793ec08', '7f397ab1bc3e0701573f5aecf3e0f2ec99474f14e118e7490ba54ac1c39a17c6', '1c2fa4ffb6489ce917fe8d8ae672fec7acef434518b834faa3b1c192a6d71c80', 'feb8e7c1ac988150f08d85be7cdbdd266e35959fb8469904ade57ea87e21d321', '76a0ccc6cc0d6c1e218d2b341757f69b4fe5d91690ca55a0e74f115d02a52177', '6da035098fbcf2b4932d372af3597de040d9dba05b2a3896fd347918f690a9d6', '423a348c5d3443db6be462d8a1799b5ed578abdf5a96b1d00ec6aacd956c9466', 'ccacbeaf2e7bce6bbd18a99be85eef6c3bd9bb8889083e5d9099d69c202c954f', '54e5e75fa877641f665062c10a4f338fd7ddba6daecaa2b5924f6dfd227a04fc', 'fcb4b584ab71a6673084294734994a63f64c390631807d058bdabc39b8e51902', '0a0c282b80c01b1068f9dc3a89491534ed51fab88d907a37996b430a47f6473c', '288048dbd3d4bb3e7a0158b37a67867d2ac8791bcbaedf8b0bbf53a0029caa90', 'a567688b73bf01949bf6e30933814c2d5af9ca0a089bea2b6a0b8b9c3c481f53', 'addab48f3e1b5db4eb1a224a9fa593369fb0d8740c926e5ab148a8d6a736431b', 'abed3c678d4365ccf383d965ec44580b8f2346765131b64f68f78d09809565e6']"

My initial reaction was: “who, me? I’m barely more than a summer student myself!” But today a light bulb went off: “hey, if these ambitious whippersnappers really want to do my research for me, why shouldn’t I let them do it — thereby freeing up my own time for more important priorities like blogging?”
I’ve therefore decided to list three project ideas. If you’re an undergrad or grad student who wants to tackle one of them this summer at the University of Waterloo, email me (scott at scottaaronson dot com). Tell me about yourself and what you want to do, and attach a CV. I’ll pick up to two students. Deadline: Feb. 21 or until positions are filled.
Scott Aaronson is an equal opportunity employer. He doesn’t have his own funding, so if you can bring your own, great; if not, he’ll try to scrounge some from under Mike Lazaridis’s couch. If the projects listed below don’t interest you — or if you’re more interested in physics, engineering, or information theory than in quantum complexity — there are many, many potential supervisors at both the Institute for Quantum Computing and the Perimeter Institute who’d probably be a better match for you.
Project #1: The Learnability of Quantum States. For this project, you’d first read and understand my paper of the same name, ideally before the summer started. You’d then implement my quantum state reconstruction algorithm in Matlab, Mathematica, or any other environment of your choice, and study its performance with realistic physical systems. This is a crucial first step if experimentalists are ever going to be convinced to try my quantum state learning approach. (The fact that I proved it works is completely irrelevant to them…) There’s also plenty of scope for new theoretical ideas if you swing that way. The eventual goal would be to publish the results somewhere like Physical Review Letters. This project is highly recommended.
Project #2: Multiple Quantum Proofs. Today we believe that there are mathematical truths that you could efficiently verify if given a small quantum state, but that you couldn’t efficiently verify if given a short classical string. But what if you were given two quantum states, which were guaranteed to be unentangled with each other? Would that let you verify even more truths than you could with a single quantum state? The answer is, we have no idea! Nor do we know whether three quantum proofs are more powerful than two, etc. When it comes to the power of multiple quantum proofs, even the most embarrassingly simple questions are open. In this project, you’d work with me to try and sort out the mess. This project is only for students who are confident of their ability to do original research in theoretical computer science.
Project #3: Insert Your Own Project. Wow me. Dazzle me. Give me a specific, detailed idea for a research project in quantum complexity theory or a related area, and convince me that you’re ferocious enough to get somewhere with it in one summer. I’ll try to help where I can.",3121,"['411fe9b352d46d2c56021196a638bfb6e10f80f98860aff35d9c9dfec7de9fbe', 'a351f44b8a2a8452402266bcd36f0cfd8db21f5736e4b7681d165cdb49c874ce', '76ad7b4bd1bf03001529e0a7b2d37bade5a46f04fdcbf650771e82b4d950e8ce', 'b4bfae59a64e19566a19b52d6e1ca0cf9aafef82e273a5990d1728f5da98c869', 'e00e41d51b7efe6d2dd7135a7fc10f82e9f54186fefebfa73f815535353f23ba', '17b2559f78ed3eb291568a1f08c0b5ae045a2b4620a3f15836e497883584542a', '04321e825150e191a21d1bc325eaee41183e77cf43cb485b87aebe1ff1c265c6', 'b10d833849e1225b6e1b238e626516b45248de07ef825f948c2788a94261681f', 'e51d82773898f2d691e017de16f27c1cb32ed3ef33e61dba08d1715bd6b11bae', '2da455edb32591a60bd3d12f0f7e01f96c1fd99d2723e3381d206925aefbf991', 'e135fd507c7343f980864a1da9a3f3e3c775fc98a1a6ee6300a3ff643700ad23', 'e100c438558f25a5507de450973d26e3f6b29a76e9d2cc5f3da43661202ba327', '32a90aa3c3467c6e704e10b6fd165474d829cb9aa09cdb32afcadd250994250c']"

More nuggets coming soon (i.e., as soon as I have my layovers in Auckland and LAX en route to Toronto) Nope, I was too lazy. Plus I caught a cold on the plane from which I’m just now recovering.
- Aram Harrow (joint work with Sean Hallgren) generalized the Recursive Fourier Sampling problem of Bernstein and Vazirani, to give superpolynomial quantum black-box speedups based not only on the Fourier transform, but on almost any unitary transformation.
- Falk Unger discussed his joint result with Richard Cleve, William Slofstra, and Sarvagya Upadhyay, that if Alice and Bob share unlimited quantum entanglement and are playing n Bell inequality games in parallel, then they might as well just play each game separately (i.e., there’s no advantage in correlating their strategies across multiple games). Surprisingly, this is provably false if Alice and Bob don’t share entanglement.
- Alexandra Kolla discussed her joint result with Sean Hallgren, Pranab Sen, and Shengyu Zhang, that any classical statistical zero-knowledge protocol can be made secure against quantum attacks. This generalizes a previous result of John Watrous (STOC’06), that certain specific SZK protocols can be made secure against quantum attacks. Shengyu was supposed to give the talk; Alexandra had to fill in for him on a few days’ notice since he couldn’t get a travel visa.
- Troy Lee discussed his new negative-weight adversary method for proving quantum lower bounds (joint work with Peter Høyer and Robert Špalek), which improves the previous methods of Ambainis, Zhang, and others, and finally breaks through the so-called certificate complexity barrier. Unfortunately, the new method is so non-intuitive that right now the authors can only apply it with the aid of semidefinite programming solvers. But this old lowerboundsgeezer is hoping that, once the young ‘uns get a better handle on their new toy, they’ll be able to use it to finally demolish some of the old open problems in quantum lower bounds.
- Daniel Gottesman proved (joint work with Dorit Aharonov and Julia Kempe) that finding the ground state of a one-dimensional spin chain with nearest-neighbor interactions is already QMA-complete. Since the analogous classical problem is solvable in polynomial time, it had been conjectured that the quantum version is too, but this intuition turns out to be wrong.
- Yi-Kai Liu showed (joint work with Matthias Christandl and Frank Verstraete) that several problems of longstanding interest to chemists are QMA-complete. These problems include deciding whether a set of local density matrices is compatible with some global density matrix; and the “N-representability” problem (namely, deciding whether a quantum state of two m-mode fermions is extendible to a state of N m-mode fermions, where m=O(poly(N)).
- Francois Le Gall gave an exponential separation between randomized and quantum space complexity in the online setting (that is, the setting where the input bits are fed to an algorithm one at a time, with no possibility of going backward).
- Gus Gutoski showed (joint work with John Watrous) that if two omniscient gods are playing a quantum chess game by shuttling qubits back and forth via a polynomial-time intermediary, who will measure the qubits at the end to decide the winner, then it’s possible in deterministic exponential time to decide which god will win. Or to say it much more clearly, QRG=EXP.
- Iordanis Kerenidis discussed his joint result with Dmitry Gavinsky, Julia Kempe, Ran Raz, and Ronald de Wolf, that there exists a partial Boolean function whose quantum one-way communication complexity is exponentially smaller than its randomized one-way communication complexity. Previously this was only known for relation problems.
- Ike Chuang gave an update on experimental quantum computing. His talk included a lot of graphs of damped sine curves.
- I gave my tired old talk on learnability of quantum states.",4034,"['700f68780cbafba8baf39b30214319a3b9ab4e64aa41cacbda9fd0c0fa597c29', '60d8e4b08f7f9b7ba65d2e2cd9aa46e6716fd856f65e8bd84030902a770e856f', 'c7fe2214ab00e2e45dee7c9d5f61166f411ae7880053f94b5315383f6b42be55', '0d6db462a64287c483219aedf7771d05c36bfd9f2f2a5721190a7c100f6b8df4', '80e4d0ab229f91d9c41d5c931b4b8e94f19310121b1bca0ea62eada830a49c3e', '135100fcd40e21202e098ab5f083f97d46a27cae931289c76140446c7075de62', 'dd0738115fc15ad3f1c1d027ed7d2f8674c89c79bab7237201cb92f0a5923c50', '0f5fcac19ae85be125e55fdfce686000efed6d7143a2393dc90f21607804c50b', 'e96ceaf244b4822570cc194c441c0954ea0dce943c630c2a1f2194758b9e5e2c']"

And, like, everyone’s expecting me to blog about all the wild talks and poster presentations going down in Q-Town? But, like, I don’t actually want to blog about that stuff, since it seems suspiciously close to useful content, the very thing this blog was created to avoid?
I’m therefore declaring an Open Shtetl Day, for all of my readers who happen to be in Brisbane. Here’s how it works: using the comments section, tell the world about your QIP experience. What were the best talks/results/open problems? What happened at the business meeting? (I actually want to know — I skipped it.) What are the most salacious rumors about who’s coauthoring with whom? C’mon, you know you want to post, and you know you’ve got nothing better to do. I can see I’m not the only one in this lecture hall who’s typing away on a laptop.

273,181,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=181,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2006-12-21,Scott Aaronson,Mercenary in the String Wars,"My sojourn in Northern California is now at an end; on Sunday I flew to my parents’ place near Philadelphia for Hanukhrismanewyears. But not before going to Stanford to give a talk to their string theory group about “Computational Complexity and the Anthropic Principle.” Here are the notes from that talk; you can think of them as a Quantum Computing Since Democritus Special Bonus Lecture.
(The best part of the talk — the lengthy arguments with Lenny Susskind, Andrei Linde, and the other stringers and cosmologists, in which I repeatedly used humor to mask my utter lack of understanding — is sadly lost to eternity. Fortunately, I’m sure that new such arguments will erupt in the comments section.)
In preparation for meeting Susskind and the other Stanford stringers, I made sure to brush up on both sides of the String Wars. On the anti-string side, I read Peter Woit’s Not Even Wrong and Lee Smolin’s The Trouble With Physics. On the pro-string side, I read Susskind’s The Cosmic Landscape and also spent hours talking with Greg Kuperberg, who tried to convince me that critics of string theory are as “intellectually non-serious” as quantum computing skeptics or Ralph Nader voters. I heartily recommend all three of the books.
So, what did I learn at Stanford? Among other things, that when you talk to string theorists in person, they’re much more open-minded and reasonable than you’d expect! Of course, when your de facto spokesman is the self-parodying Luboš Motl — who often manages to excoriate feminists, climatologists, and loop quantum gravity theorists in the very same sentence — it’s hard not to seem reasonable by comparison. But I’m not even talking about him.
(Conflict-of-interest warning: I’m painfully well aware that, so long as Luboš is around, I can only ever be the second-funniest physics blogger — even if the world champion in this field isn’t trying to be funny.)
In general, I’ve found that tolerance for alternative ideas, willingness to engage with counterarguments, rejection of appeals to authority, and so on are all greater when talking to string theorists in person than when attending their talks or reading their books and articles. Maybe that’s to be expected — to some extent it’s true of every field! But with string theorists, the magnitude of the difference always astonishes me.
Alright, let me get more concrete. One of the few nontrivial points of agreement between string theory and loop quantum gravity seems to be that, in any bounded region of spacetime, the number of bits of information is finite: at most ~1069 bits per square meter of surface area, or (equivalently) at most ~1 bit per Planck area. In loop quantum gravity, this is basically because one bit of information is “stored” in each Planck area. In string theory, it’s much more subtle than that: the bits of information can’t be put into any sort of one-to-one correspondence with the Planck areas on the horizon, but they both add up to the same number. (Ignoring a factor of 4, which being a complexity theorist, I don’t care about.)
Now, much of my conversation with Susskind and fellow string theorist Steve Shenker focused on the following question: isn’t it a bizarre coincidence that the Planck areas and the bits of information should both add up to the same number, if there’s no “dual” description of string theory in which each bit (or rather qubit) is stored in a Planck area? Susskind agreed with me that such a “local” description of string theory (local on the boundary, not in the bulk) would be desirable — and that, if there isn’t such a description, then that by itself is a fundamental fact worthy of more attention. I’d expected Susskind and Shenker to brush aside my question as idle pontificating; instead, they seemed to want to reinvent string theory that very afternoon so that my question would have an answer!
When it became clear that no such reinvention of the theory was forthcoming (at least that afternoon), I suggested the following. We’ve got this one proposal, string theory, which has had some spectacular technical successes (like “explaining” the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy), but which, setting aside its other well-known problems, offers no “local” description of spacetime in terms of qubits and quantum circuits at the Planck scale. Then we’ve got this other proposal, loop quantum gravity, which has had fewer successes, but which does attempt such a local description at the Planck scale. So, if we agree that such a local description is our eventual goal, then shouldn’t an outsider guess that string theory and loop quantum gravity are probably just different footprints of the same beast — much like the different string theories themselves were found to be different limiting cases of an as-yet-unknown M-theory?
Susskind agreed that such a convergence — between the “top-down” picture of string theory, which grew out of conventional high-energy physics, and a “bottom-up” picture in terms of qubits at the Planck scale — was possible or even likely. He stressed that his opposition was not to the idea of describing spacetime in terms of local interactions of qubits, but rather to the specific technical program of loop quantum gravity, and to the exaggerated claims often made on that program’s behalf. When I reminded him that other people complain about exaggerated claims made on string theory’s behalf, he replied that the two cases were not even remotely comparable.
All in all, it was an extremely productive and enjoyable visit — one in which the conversation topics ranged over (among other things) the explanatory role of the Anthropic Principle, the possibility that the entire universe arose as a quantum fluctuation, the prospects for an efficient quantum algorithm for Graph Isomorphism, the relation between thermodynamics and quantum error-correction, and whether or not Gerard ‘t Hooft actually disbelieves quantum mechanics. Susskind told me, half-jokingly, that the Stanford string theory group was the world’s hotbed of anti-Landscape sentiment, and the arguments that I saw and participated in on my visit gave me no reason to doubt him.
So what are we to make of the fact that, on the one hand, the string theorists are such swell folks in person, and on the other hand, even the most cursory glance at their writings will reveal that the charge of triumphalist arrogance is far from undeserved? Well, to the anti-stringers, the obvious interpretation will be that the string theorists don’t really believe their own pablum: that they say one thing in public and a completely different thing in private. To the pro-stringers, the obvious interpretation will be that, beneath the façade we all erect around ourselves, the string theorists are just scientists like anyone else: grasping at the truth, struggling to learn more, convinced that string theory is the best idea we have but ready to ditch it if something better comes along. As usual, it all depends on where you’re coming from.
Alas, as tidy as this resolution sounds, it doesn’t help me pick sides in the String Wars currently raging through the blogosphere. But then again, why do I need to pick sides? I like hanging out with the loop quantum gravity people at Perimeter Institute. I like the fact that Lee Smolin’s publisher sent me a free review copy of The Trouble With Physics. I like the recent paper by Denef and Douglas on computational complexity and the string Landscape. And I like getting an all-expenses-paid trip to Stanford to have a freewheeling, day-long intellectual conversation with the string theorists there.
I have therefore reached a decision. From this day forward, my allegiances in the String Wars will be open for sale to the highest bidder. Like a cynical arms merchant, I will offer my computational-complexity and humor services to both sides, and publicly espouse the views of whichever side seems more interested in buying them at the moment. Fly me to an exotic enough location, put me up in a swank enough hotel, and the number of spacetime dimensions can be anything you want it to be: 4, 10, 11, or even 172.9+3πi. Is it more important for a quantum gravity theory to connect to the Standard Model, or to build in background-independence from the outset? Can one use the Anthropic Principle to make falsifiable predictions? How much is riding on whether or not the LHC finds supersymmetry? I might have opinions on these topics, but they’re nothing that a cushy job offer or a suitcase full of “reimbursements” couldn’t change.
Someday, perhaps, a dramatic new experimental finding or theoretical breakthrough will change the situation vis-à-vis string theory and its competitors. Until then, I shall answer to no quantum-gravity research program, but rather seek to profit from them all.
Update (12/23): The indefatigable Luboš Motl has put up a new jeremiad against me. Taking my ‘For Sale’ announcement completely seriously, Luboš writes:
It is absolutely impossible for me to hide how intensely I despise people like Scott Aaronson … He’s the ultimate example of a complete moral breakdown of a scientist. It is astonishing that the situation became so bad that the people are not only corrupt and dishonest but they proudly announce this fact on their blogs…
In fact, I have learned that the situation is so bad that when I simply state that Aaronson’s attitude is flagrantly incompatible with the ethical standards of a scholar as they have been understood for centuries, there could be some parts of the official establishment that would support him against me. There doesn’t seem to be a single blog article besides mine that denounces Aaronson’s attitude…
The difference between [the] two of us is like the difference between a superman from the action movies who fights for the universal justice on one side and the most dirty corrupt villain on the other side. It’s like the Heaven and the Hell, freedom and feminism, careful evaluation of the climate and the alarmist hysteria, or string theory and loop quantum gravity…
I can’t tell you how proud I am to have become “the most dirty corrupt villain” in Luboš’s cosmology, and no longer just an anonymous bystander. Thanks so much, Luboš, and Merry Christmas to you too!

Given a 3SAT formula φ, it’s NP-hard to decide whether (1) φ is satisfiable or (2) at most a 1-ε fraction of the clauses are satisfiable, promised that one of these is the case. Here ε is a constant independent of n.
In recent weeks, I’ve become increasingly convinced that a Quantum PCP Theorem like the following will one day be a crowning achievement of quantum complexity theory:
Given a set of local measurements on an n-qubit register, it’s QMA-hard to decide whether (1) there exists a state such that all of the measurements accept with probability 1, or (2) for every state, at most a 1-ε fraction of the measurements accept with probability more than 1-δ, promised that one of these is the case. Here a “local” measurement is one that acts on at most (say) 3 qubits, and ε and δ are constants independent of n.
I’m 99% sure that this theorem (alright, conjecture) or something close to it is true. I’m 95% sure that the proof will require a difficult adaptation of classical PCP machinery (whether Iritean or pre-Iritean), in much the same way that the Quantum Fault-Tolerance Theorem required a difficult adaptation of classical fault-tolerance machinery. I’m 85% sure that the proof is achievable in a year or so, should enough people make it a priority. I’m 75% sure that the proof, once achieved, will open up heretofore undreamt-of vistas of understanding and insight. I’m 0.01% sure that I can prove it. And that is why I hereby bequeath the actual proving part to you, my readers.
Notes:
- By analogy to the classical case, one expects that a full-blown Quantum PCP Theorem would be preceded by weaker results (“quantum assignment testers”, quantum PCP’s with weaker parameters, etc). So these are obviously the place to start.
- Why hasn’t anyone tackled this question yet? Well, one reason is that it’s hard. But a second reason is that people keep getting hung up on exactly how to formulate the question. To forestall further nitpicking, I hereby declare it obvious that a “Quantum PCP Theorem” means nothing more or less than a robust version of Kitaev’s QMA-completeness theorem, in exactly the same sense that the classical PCP Theorem was a robust version of the Cook-Levin Theorem.

Given an n-qubit pure state, is there always a way to apply Hadamard gates to some subset of the qubits, so as to make all 2n computational basis states have nonzero amplitudes?
Today Ashley Montanaro and Dan Shepherd of the University of Bristol sent me the answer, in a beautiful 4-page writeup that they were kind enough to let me post here. (The answer, as I expected, is yes.)
This is a clear advance in humankind’s scientific knowledge, which is directly traceable to this blog. I am in a good mood today.
The obvious next question is to find an α>0 such that, for any n-qubit pure state, there’s some way to apply Hadamards to a subset of the qubits so as to make all 2n basis states have |amplitude| at least α. Clearly we can’t do better than α=sinn(π/8). Montanaro and Shepherd conjecture that this is tight.

Thirteen Reasons Why I’d Be Surprised If Quantum Computing Were Fundamentally Impossible
So that there’s no question about exactly where I stand, I’ll start out by repeating, for the ten billionth time, the Official Scott Aaronson Quantum Computing Position Statement.
- It’s entirely conceivable that quantum computing will turn out to be impossible for a fundamental reason.
- This would be much more interesting than if it’s possible, since it would overturn our most basic ideas about the physical world.
- The only real way to find out is to try to build a quantum computer.
- Such an effort seems to me at least as scientifically important as (say) the search for supersymmetry or the Higgs boson.
- I have no idea — none — how far it will get in my lifetime.
I now offer thirteen arguments to support the above views.
- The Obvious Argument. Quantum mechanics has been the foundation for all non-gravitational physics since 1926. Hoping that it would “just go away” has been one of the most consistently losing strategies in the history of science. If physicists and engineers didn’t take quantum mechanics seriously as a description of the world, they wouldn’t have been able to invent the laser, transistor, or classical computer. For that matter, they wouldn’t be able to explain why all the atoms in the universe don’t instantly disintegrate. Now, if you start with quantum mechanics, and write down the model of computation that directly flows from it, what do you end up with? BQP: Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time.
- The Experimental Argument. Ten years ago, one wouldn’t have been able to do much more than mount a general defense of quantum mechanics. But by now, liquid-NMR quantum computers have been built that not only factored 15 into 3 x 5 with small probability of error, but also searched 8-item databases. I’ve seen some of the machines that performed these staggering computational feats right here in Waterloo; they look like big-ass cylinders with the word “Bruker” on them. Seriously, while liquid-NMR (at least for now) doesn’t seem to be scalable, there’s been lots of recent work on solid-state NMR, photonics, and ion traps, all of which (if I’m not mistaken) are up to at least 3 qubits. While I don’t think the experimentalists are anywhere close to succeeding, these are smart people who haven’t been sitting on their asses (or if they have, then no doubt hard at work at a lab table or something).
- The Better-Shor-Than-More Argument. Why do skeptics always assume that, if quantum mechanics turns out to be only approximate, then whatever theory supersedes it will reinstate the Extended Church-Turing Thesis? Why isn’t it just as likely, a priori, that the new theory would yield even more computational power than BQP? This isn’t merely a logical point: to the extent that people have tried to propose serious alternatives to quantum mechanics (where “serious” means “agreeing with known experiments”), those alternatives often do involve more computational power than BQP.
- The Sure/Shor Argument. If you believe quantum mechanics is going to break down before nontrivial quantum computing becomes possible, then you must believe there’s some point where it will break down — some level of size, or complexity, or whatever, at which it will cease to be a useful description of the world. What is that point? In other words, where is the line — possibly a fuzzy, asymptotic, resource-dependent line — that puts the quantum states that have already been observed on one side, and the quantum states that arise in Shor’s factoring algorithm on the other? In a paper I wrote three years ago, I called such a line a “Sure/Shor separator,” and challenged skeptics to come up with some example of what it might be. I even tried to get the ball rolling by studying such separators myself. My idea was that having a Sure/Shor separator could motivate further research: once they knew where the “barrier” was, the experimentalists could set to work trying to cross it; then, if they succeeded, the skeptics could come back with a new barrier, and so on. Unfortunately, no skeptic has yet risen to the challenge. It’s not hard to see why: if you start with the many-particle entangled states that have already been observed (for example, by the Zeilinger group and by Ghosh et al.) and then throw in a few closure properties, you quickly end up with — well, the set of all quantum states. Coming up with a “reasonable” set of states that includes Sure states but doesn’t include Shor states turns out to be an extremely hard problem.
- The Linearity Argument. In my experience, at least 70% of all objections to quantum computing boil down to the idea that a quantum computer would be a “souped-up analog computer” — a machine that would store information not in voltage differences or the positions of pulleys, but instead in exponentially-small amplitudes. From this idea it follows readily that, just as “old-school” analog computers have always run up against scalability problems, so too will quantum computers. To see why the analogy fails, think about classical probabilities. If you flip a coin a thousand times, you’ll end up with a probability distribution over outcomes that requires real numbers of order 2-1000 to describe. Does it follow from this that classical probabilistic computers are really analog computers in disguise, or that classical probability theory must be a mere approximation to some deeper, underlying theory? Of course not — for, unlike voltages or pulleys, probabilities evolve in time by means of norm-preserving linear transformations, which are insensitive to small errors. Well, quantum amplitudes also evolve by means of norm-preserving linear transformations, and this is what makes them behave like probabilities with respect to error, and not like the state variables of an analog computer.
- The Fault-Tolerance Argument. Among the many nontrivial consequences of this linearity, there’s one that probably counts as a separate argument: the Threshold Theorem. This theorem states that even if a quantum computer is subject to noise, we can still use it to do universal computation, provided we have parallel processing and a supply of fresh qubits, and provided the error rate is at most ε per qubit per time step, for some constant ε>0 independent of the length of the computation. The original lower bound on ε was about 10-6, but recently Knill and others have brought it up to 1-3% under plausible assumptions. Many quantum computing researchers talk about this theorem as the knight in shining armor who rode in unexpectedly to vindicate all their hopes. They’re entitled to do so, but to me, the theorem has always felt more like a beautiful, detailed working-out of something that couldn’t possibly have been false. (And not just because it’s a theorem.)
- The What-A-Waste Argument. Why do I say that the threshold theorem “couldn’t possibly have been false”? Well, suppose quantum mechanics were an accurate description of reality, yet quantum computing was still impossible for some fundamental reason. In that case, we’d have to accept that Nature was doing a staggering amount of quantum computation that could never be “extracted,” even in principle. Indeed, even assuming that life is (and always will be) confined to the vicinity of one planet, the resulting computational waste would make the waste of 1011 uninhabited galaxies look like chickenfeed. I don’t deny that such a possibility is logically consistent, but my complexity-theoretic instincts rebel against it.
- The Non-Extravagance Argument. In my opinion, if quantum computers could solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, then there really would be grounds for regarding them as physically extravagant. Like coming up with theories that allow causality violations and superluminal signalling, coming up with models of computation that can simulate NP, #P, and PSPACE is just too easy. It’s not interesting. The interesting task is to come up with a model of computation that’s stronger than the usual ones (P, BPP, and P/poly), but not so strong that it encompasses NP-complete problems. If it weren’t for BQP, I don’t think I’d have any clear idea of what such a model could look like. (Sure, we have problems and complexity classes below NP, but that’s different from a full-fledged model of computation.)
- The Turn-The-Tables Argument. If building quantum computers that outperform classical ones is fundamentally impossible, then it must be possible to write classical computer programs that efficiently simulate any quantum system found in Nature. And yet, even though this way of looking at the question is perfectly equivalent, there’s a reason quantum computing skeptics avoid it. This is that, as soon as you frame the issue this way, they (the skeptics) are the ones who look like wild-eyed technological optimists — believing we’ll be able to simulate superconductors and quark-gluon plasmas on an ordinary desktop PC! The “staid,” “conservative” position is that such a simulation won’t be possible — or, equivalently, that the systems being simulated have more computational power than the PC doing the simulating.
- The Island-In-Theoryspace Argument. String theorists have been ridiculed for claiming that string theory is “too beautiful to be wrong.” But as Peter Woit points out in his fascinating new book, this is not at all a bad argument. It’s a fine argument; the real question is whether string theory — with its perturbation series, ten dimensions of which six are compactified for unknown reasons, landscape of vacua, etc. — really is as beautiful as its proponents think it is. At the risk of breaking my vow, let me hasten to say that I’m in no position to judge. What I do know is that there’s something mathematically unique about quantum mechanics: how it takes advantage of special properties of the L2 norm that fail for other p-norms, how the parameter-counting for mixed states that works perfectly with complex numbers fails with real numbers and quaternions, and so on. Crucially, it seems all but impossible to change quantum mechanics while retaining its nice properties. More so than general relativity or any other theory we have, quantum mechanics gives every indication of being an island in theoryspace.
- The Only-Game-In-Town Argument. However one feels about the alternatives to string theory — loop quantum gravity, spin foams, twistors, and so on — at least each one has a “developer base,” a community of physicists who are actively trying to make it work. By contrast, I don’t know of any picture of the world in which quantum computing is impossible, that’s being actively developed by any research community anywhere. (Gerard ‘t Hooft and Stephen Wolfram are not research communities.) All the skepticism of quantum computing that I’m aware of is purely negative in character.
- The Historical Argument. If the above arguments are sound, then why haven’t people already succeeded in building quantum computers? It’s been what, ten years already? Some historical perspective might be helpful here: in Samuel Johnson’s The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia, written in 1759, Johnson has one of his characters give a correct explanation of why heavier-than-air flying machines should be physically possible, and then build a test plane that promptly plummets into a lake. Johnson was safe in ridiculing the idea; it would be another 144 years before Kitty Hawk. Closer to our topic, Darwin wrote in his autobiography about an eccentric loon of his acquaintance, who dreamed of building an engine to automate routine human thought. Though the loon — a certain Charles Babbage — hadn’t run afoul of any fundamental theory, his proposal to build a classical computer was a century ahead of its time. Since the 1600’s, science has often been generations ahead of technology. History gives us no reason at all to assume that a technology will be discovered to be compatible with known laws of physics at about the same time as it becomes possible to implement.
- The Trademark-Twist Argument. This last argument is the hardest one to articulate, but possibly the most compelling to my mind. In my view, Nature has been telling us, over and over and over, that our everyday intuitions will match the physical world if and only if we first apply a little “twist” to them. Often this twist involves an unusual symmetry, or switching from the L1 to the L2 norm, or inserting negative or complex numbers where our intuition says that only nonnegative real numbers would make sense. We see such a twist in special relativity, in the metric that’s not positive definite but instead has a (-1,1,1,1) signature. We see it in the -1 phase that the universe picks up when you swap a fermion with its identical twin. We see it in the fact that, to rotate an electron back to where it was, you have to turn it not 360o but 720o. We see it in the Dirac equation. We see it, of course, in quantum mechanics itself.

Just take the problem from the paper Exponential algorithmic speedup by quantum walk by Andrew Childs et al. Here the oracle encodes an exponentially large graph, consisting of two binary trees conjoined at the leaves by a random cycle:
Each vertex is labeled by a random string, and given the label of a vertex, the oracle tells us the labels of its neighbors. Then, given the label of the Entrance vertex, the problem is to decide (let’s say) whether the label of the Exit vertex starts with a 1 or a 0.
Childs et al. proved that this oracle problem is in BQP but not in BPP. Intuitively, any classical random walk on the graph will get stuck for an exponentially long time in the enormous middle region, but because of interference effects, a quantum walk will tunnel right through to the Exit vertex with 1/polynomial probability.
Now, it’s easy to generalize their proof that the problem is not in BPP, to show that it’s not in SZK. One way to see this is that, for a prover to convince a verifier of the solution, the prover will (basically) have to reveal where the Exit vertex is, thereby violating the zero-knowledge property. Another way to see it is that, if we consider the Sahai-Vadhan characterization of SZK in terms of the Statistical Difference problem, then neither of the two distributions we’re comparing will depend non-negligibly on the Exit vertex.
Disappointingly, this solution is way too trivial to publish, and almost too trivial even to blog. On the other hand, so far I’ve been unable to extend the solution to get an oracle relative to which BQP is not in AM. Every variant of the problem I’ve come up with is in AM intersect coAM, sometimes for non-obvious reasons. Anyone want to help me?",1745,"['14d85546886519189cf052ac61ce929688c976007a352b4ef68063d9b24b3937', '56b1129c1d807d73fb62d232ee109136863a47842cc98d63bbf2ea5f80ef2fda', '442cf8d3b58352a393bfdc28bfa9c8afc6acdbe24604a58b474e91f09ba0ab11', 'ca8a8f85d87e04e69532d6e02c503d6ad33184eab7556642aadb14a048791f8f', 'c9eecaa5226ad4a46eecf2f1f834094343038e1df7f1ae32dddf6cb7c64f9663', '47fadda53bb4d661b550014fb30b51ef9115aada14643359d0d4d9d299f607d3']"

- Can we get any upper bound on QMIP (quantum multi-prover interactive proofs with unlimited prior entanglement)? It would suffice to show (for example) that the provers never need more than Ackermann(n) ebits of entanglement.
- Can any QMA(2) (QMA with two unentangled yes-provers) protocol be amplified to exponentially small error probability? If you think the answer is trivially yes, think about it some more!
- If a unitary operation U can be applied in polynomial time, then can some square root of U also be applied in polynomial time?
- Suppose Alice and Bob are playing n parallel CHSH games, with no communication or entanglement. Is the probability that they’ll win all n games at most pn, for some p bounded below 0.853?
- Forget about an oracle relative to which BQP is not in PH. Forget about an oracle relative to which BQP is not in AM. Is there an oracle relative to which BQP is not in SZK?
- Given any n-qubit unitary operation U, does there exist an oracle relative to which U can be (approximately) applied in polynomial time?
- How many mutually unbiased bases are there in non-prime-power dimensions? (Alright, I don’t care about this one, but so many people do that I figured I’d put it in.)
- Is there an n-qubit pure state that can be prepared by a circuit of size n3, and that can’t be distinguished from the maximally mixed state by any circuit of size n2?

Unfortunately, the wiki site has been down for days and shows no signs of coming back anytime soon. So for now, I’ve put the old Zoo back up at www.complexityzoo.com. I’ve learned my lesson: in times of crisis, it takes a leader with an iron fist to keep the trains running on time and the animals in their cages.
John Baez is back on the scene, with an account of his recent visit to our quantum computing group at Waterloo. Among other things, he gives a lucid explanation of how, while it’s generally impossible to keep information from leaking out of a computer, it is possible to arrange things so that the information that does leak is irrelevant to the computation. Baez links to the papers that prove this is true for quantum computing as well as classical, but complains that “most of it speaks the language of ‘error correction’ rather than thermodynamics.” Question for the audience: can the fault-tolerance theorems be reproved more physicsly? (“We now define a PHYSICAL SYSTEM called the concatenated Steane code…”)
Baez’s semi-conversion to the Church of Knill, Laflamme, and Zurek (or the Shul of Aharonov and Ben-Or) has inspired me to propose a far-reaching hypothesis:
While it’s generally impossible to explain computer science concepts to physicists so that they understand them on your terms, it is sometimes possible to explain them so that they understand on their terms.
Naturally, it helps if the physicist in question is Baez.",1600,"['18df3122728c110935a5bea43b19789baddaf5f0c15060282b0c14f02756ac58', 'da7b0c8b50289b5bad78ba9348b2d5031769256b8ce5eb4a2eb89b5758e3af7c', 'edbb44bb252cc555443d7d66447a1354b1623761c4156dfd0e7d5be0c8a7f121', '164d53ea0b8b3ae1558560b338cd76e4d747b2fe58efd585c86f8931a053c843', 'c068731753c14606a9926f9b998c0016ba65970cb47744492532f8526941acb1', '1701004f79893ece2b47d56207a4ce97ee4fffdedc8ff04d3669f9950f428d62', 'a86e4d13853d25d5b842c3a5054cdff135ec12742493ee348c86063b3ea7eaa4', 'dfaf318f98fa8b63293dfa8015505c7fa2e73d81f15c055408560bf596a4a89a', '27d5f3e3f15a11e4ce8dcd0329c42b9c6bde6cacfb65abf9d050feb7cc5ddd2e', 'b77b0f6a2a35609a328c8e8ea7a9b2d06a5aa8437fe369d794e87ef005a81004', '2fbfc05cd7af32cdbf762a65af8dc194ae9415be12758006d222a93aaf4835ae', '1cb7f87e856b973d95018b627bbf352d9a42c81af664e67d3e9a8579684ff8f9', '22a11f0f67f5983b0323877405718436c76ae2df2a61faf9396cc753bdecb346', '2c60aefd99fcceb91dbc4d73fa69685d9a7acf4449efc49446c0f498432872fe', '48d29c921d8b0e9450dbb04db97ef4b0586a239b7e6bc855d21b4ba844a3de7c', '7d65abe3d6e16d5cdb0916a1a4d54ff8c79bd6d4108a82fb9fed9d23eecc63bf', '477f5cc6756b208cc03a2993a58307ce5da9d819556faa56047ae250751cf3e1', '0098e39b2a1b7bf9ed372aced62018017646542ece5c21bd12498b13e71520c6', '59e11b192e372aa644f907ba322a3066b7722cb4d9022b13e04659434fc48a6b']"

So I’ll tell you what, whistling-pig-lovers: answer me the following; then come back for more.
Given a set of n-by-n real matrices, is there a nonzero linear combination of those matrices with rank 1? Equivalently, given a subspace S of a bipartite n-by-n Hilbert space, does S contain a separable state?
I’d like (1) a proof of NP-hardness for the exact version, and (2) more importantly, whether or not there’s a decent approximation algorithm. (For instance, an algorithm that finds a rank-1 matrix, with the sum of the squares of the entries equal to 1, whose L2-distance from the subspace of interest is at most a small additive constant more than optimal.)
So get cracking! If you do find a decent approximation algorithm, you’ll have shown, among other things, that QMA(2) (QMA with two unentangled yes-provers) is in EXP. Incredibly, right now we don’t have any upper bound better than NEXP.
Oh, yes: while my brain is closed, and while I can barely turn theorems into coffee, I will offer $20 for a solution to (2).

284,92,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=92,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2006-06-12,Scott Aaronson,Schrödinger’s cat is hunting masked chickens,"A commenter on my last post — who, since he or she chose not to provide a name, I’ll take the liberty of calling Dr. Doofus McRoofus — offers the following prediction about quantum computing:
[U]nless quantum computing can deliver something practical within the next five to ten years it will be as popular then as, say, PRAMs are today.
Four reactions:
- String theory has been immensely popular for over 20 years, among a much larger community, with zero prospects for delivering anything practical (or even any contact with experiment, which — ahem — some of us have had for a decade). Reasoning by analogy, if quantum computing became popular around 1995, that should at least put us in the upper range of McRoofus’s “five to ten years.”
- For better or worse, the funding outlook for quantum computing is much less depressing right now than for classical theoretical computer science. Many of us have been making the case to DARPA and NSF that classical complexity should continue to be funded in part because of its relevance for quantum computing.
- The right analogy is not between quantum computing and PRAM’s; it’s between quantum computing and parallel computing. Specific architectures, like linear optics and PRAM’s, have gone in and out of fashion. Modes of computation, like nondeterminism, randomness, parallelism, and quantumness, have instead just gotten agglomerated onto the giant rolling snowball of complexity. As long as the snowball itself continues to tumble down the hill (shoot — bad metaphor?), I don’t see any reason for this to change.
- I’m no good at predicting social trends, so perhaps time will prove me wrong and Dr. McRoofus right. But speaking for myself, I’d go insane if I had to pick research topics based on popularity. I became interested in quantum computing because of a simple trilemma: either (i) the Extended Church-Turing Thesis is false, (ii) quantum mechanics is false, or (iii) factoring is in classical polynomial time. As I put it in my dissertation, all three possibilities seem like wild, crackpot speculations, but at least one of them is true!

285,85,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=85,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2006-05-11,Scott Aaronson,The relativity of originality,"An anonymous commenter asked for my opinion of The Free Will Theorem, a much-discussed recent paper by John Conway and Simon Kochen. I’ve been putting it off, but I’ll finally will myself to say something.
I read The Free Will Theorem mostly as an amusing romp through the well-travelled philosophical terrain of quantum mechanics, relativity, and entanglement. I’ve always enjoyed Conway’s writing style, so it was a treat to see his usual jokes and puns out in full force.
Of course, the reason the paper has attracted attention is the Free Will Theorem itself, which I’ll paraphrase as follows:
Suppose that (1) the laws of physics allow something like a Bell or GHZ experiment, (2) the people doing the experiment can set their detectors any way they want (i.e., in a way not determined by the previous history of the universe), and (3) something like Lorentz invariance holds (i.e. there’s one reference frame where experimenter A measures first, and another where experimenter B measures first). Then the results of the experiment are also not determined by the previous history of the universe.
Or as the authors colorfully put it: “if indeed there exist any experimenters with a modicum of free will, then elementary particles must have their own share of this valuable commodity.”
(Note that by “free will,” all Conway and Kochen mean is the property of not being determined by the previous history of the universe. So even events with known probability distributions, like coin flips and quantum measurements, can have “free will” according to their definition.)
My reaction to the Free Will Theorem is threefold:
- It’s a very important, even if mathematically trivial, consequence of the Bell/GHZ/Kochen-Specker-type theorems.
- It will be new to many physicists.
- It was folklore among those who think about entanglement and nonlocality.
I’ll be grateful for any references in support of the last point. Right now, all I can offer is that I gave almost the same argument four years ago, in my review of Stephen Wolfram’s A New Kind of Science (see pages 9-11). My goal there was to show that no deterministic cellular-automaton model of physics, of the sort Wolfram was advocating, could possibly explain the Bell inequality violations while respecting relativistic invariance. I didn’t think I was saying anything terribly new.
Conway and Kochen try to preempt such criticism as follows:
Physicists who feel that they already knew our main result are cautioned that it cannot be proved by arguments involving symbols such as , Ψ, ⊗, since these presuppose a large and indefinite amount of physical theory.
I find this unpersuasive. For me, the whole point of the Bell, GHZ, and Kochen-Specker type theorems has always been that they don’t presuppose quantum mechanics. Instead they show that any physical theory compatible with certain experimental results has to have certain properties (such as nonlocality or contextuality).
I should admit that the Free Will Theorem improves on the argument in my book review in at least three ways:
- It gets rid of probabilities, by going through a two-party version of the Kochen-Specker Theorem instead of through Bell’s inequality. (I mentioned in my review that the argument could be redone using the GHZ paradox, which involves three parties but is deterministic. I didn’t mention that it could also be done using two-party Kochen-Specker.)
- It gives a cute, memorable name — “free will” — to something that I referred to only by convoluted phrases like “randomness that’s more fundamental than the sort Wolfram allows” (by which I meant, that’s not reducible to Alice and Bob’s subjective uncertainty about the initial state of the universe).
- It makes the assumptions more explicit. For example, I never talked about Alice and Bob’s “free will” in choosing the detector settings, since I thought that was just assumed in talking about Bell’s inequality in the first place! (In other words, if Wolfram denied that Alice and Bob could choose the detector settings independently of each other, then he could have dispensed with Bell’s inequality in a much simpler way than he actually did.)
I should also admit that I like Conway and Kochen’s paper. Indeed, the main question it raises for me is not “how could they possibly pass this off as original?” but rather “do we, as scientists, sometimes put too high a premium on originality?”
In all the reading I’ve done in philosophy, I don’t know that I’ve ever once encountered an original idea — in the sense that, say, general relativity and NP-completeness were original ideas. Indeed, whenever I read about a priority dispute between philosophers (like the infamous one between Saul Kripke and Ruth Barcan Marcus), it strikes me as absurd: all the ideas under dispute seem obvious!
But does it follow that philosophy is a waste of time? No, I don’t think it does. The same “obvious” idea can be expressed clumsily or eloquently, sketched in a sentence or developed into a book, brought out explicitly or left beneath the surface. Now, I’m well aware that that’s not an original sentiment — nor, for that matter, is anything in this post, or probably this entire blog. Yet here I am writing it, and here you are reading it.
You might respond that Wolfram can (and does) mount a similar defense of A New Kind of Science: that sure, lesser mortals might have realized decades ago that simple programs can produce complex behavior, but they didn’t grasp the true, Earth-shattering significance of that fact. Compared to Wolfram, though, I think Conway and Kochen have at least two things going for them: (1) they don’t spend 1,200 pages denigrating the work of other people, and (2) they accept quantum mechanics.
From Ecclesiastes:
All streams run to the sea,
but the sea is not full;
to the place where the streams flow,
there they continue to flow.
All things are wearisome;
more than one can express;
the eye is not satisfied with seeing,
or the ear filled with hearing.
What has been is what will be,
and what has been done is what will be done;
there is nothing new under the sun.",6094,"['b30f9da8e9006e9fb0c0ab36a6c29256cc0e730d74680f15207164501ab8ae28', '1156f26637536971f299cd2ebfcdee0f52627f253d76ed9bccdb28ad0118f08d', 'ccdfa92700fd71ffcc34625582608199a6d7af66cc908415f807f1501a94d693', '99ae7fddbb197ad13377f9bd3534423721424f3e7cda3d5367d0cb5ea565b209', '00d1c61c19d13ea698f05b7d4a4e3f1af8cdbab906a71c1497774d00e497a240', '7c71b0e9643794940336e485dca2d64bdf1911ef2ebd8924e1dc82ba81a1bc2a', '926300d2a9a26c8f072d436cdeda38a5bf5b4ccd3fd1c9a076a3d65254dd8608', 'a8471c9e8539fbc320b2247f7c12904d1e10db5c38ff85f6a20050a43e5b2b42', '299df310fa28bbf7355574226865a3128ce3f2595e90a978c15235e55478834b', '76d94b6a604472f9d5da0271f9f0459056311d0dfb4dec795ca0dbb2aa0b5850', '3648fa318105ed6b2161531f04bc489405ced21233ca1216fefbd5b10ea93fec', 'c2c11b501a7ec2a3b5df1862e9f2b6770a6527f1b59e4cb8a87253ab86fa44ab', 'f42a9989b90fb6e0798f12091bd8384c2eb522a3e03b3278c98d52800992f01b', 'dbb1ba18cfe403755d2e250dc45a22be9cc20a8a19ad3f27da2b282109018826', '1fb61e78292bcfa895c4fc54761ebee96b6c752fca649a2c483691c77f2f0f68', '940270b42f6412f22b202c12e667a53c9f44bb605ab7cbc607a89c9a96516fc5', '5cb1689c99aa8cdf7ff772fedff83dbc34e0bc6e0679fb41e94b39682dbd9a61', '83766586c4244db96c1aa070402c396bfc5924be45e62c9a71f452babdd23ec6', 'b5e660afa5e5c3a99aacbff9bec4de5236f753943c83c7e1a596e7d2acfe09a7', '8d8240ad942586562c627e6ea08a6b37860c0733948d693a81bdf2425837169f', '3b4b2c88986ce12d719c37381309d821bf4c7c6e603a1c8f1c7e7319f2957de1', 'fb347a5e4f7d72fc2d8a483dcc2900a324431bb48abfa5a6e397827fa5fe85c7', '2279927a792367147cae5dabd247d9b265b334b661a242fecea3b80cb285dfff', 'e1c955a02976ab30451afe62b680971b85a48df1ca44347e05d256271c6cb97c', '3058a335fb504917c8f23b56e1b42b3e312f12a33e78bb8d87358705c02c2dd4', 'b4e151ebb9e4c54ec9ddc57764a5417e18fcd8061b0b6f5c69afe3c03c9f1b98', '9a08bfb726d588e232b2ff392c5345e7e350a482ad29a55a21650a69ba1028da', '237ff58eb98a4e72b4228cffddafe429203a2c056f188b852e7dfb7a3491a339', '9e4092e00f32915bccd10978dc3b3bcfb438fc0a4c884cc4733203812014ad97', '8a2ba6477c3110c4731c06e44a54006b5bd71880f4e751719376afc1ba5c0317', 'e47ab05f5df39415adebb2ac98b203d5be1f975fab26f639c9f3d64125a6fc8c', 'dc3ce17322c880841b146431868b8aff011c8f684d5ee87fdf972ca277ea7e5f', '37c12e64772ba76bae695d9faac70fcf7d93b87e22e8a63247d4eae312c9ebaa', '9bcff7ea34277fe56a6101a128bbefd70ba6d7af396504fcc82ca1fc8809a795', '499c059c519c6faa4c46c31512c15c16c9b7aaef1b20235f4bfa9204e3257e33', '17e17cdc34e5d70f28852f900fa08fcf739cf702220b25c0a2956e1c71b99a42', 'b6428c06fc46781828e857a5b5536b7232c2c6c2f90ed4dccb34919e82700e38', 'd7dcd26446d8723e8c019a0e326a287342cec5b916b9216d49c2cca3beea6da7', 'd33daee13bafb04ddb98edb782ddccb4035529ecbd6e36367955bbd6459ad9f0', 'f81b6d2333499943bd17e73956f909975199f6e16f41b412ad5fc9527f6fe032', '65c16276cb22f412a3c99ed1a1d5ea2772a1039efd9f679025bdb82c3f4a1996', '4d843fc06df92838ec14be68d992d43b606a5ea9b7391d1978f78dad9f78f209', '647285fbaf167ef241a116f8817f6969e2ae2c7bdd4c99b76e02d0c691bc3aad', '5396a8317c9e9dae3a961f4fbb8dfba31da92db4f4f29ccf5a82532c923ce959', 'ce351b0fed4d56b547ac2e6ee8d914fde5c894c6dd4ebbf956cc5bf99e014421', '27297c817be168b367ed8ae555819fa124fabf781a0d020e8e65827b0802e32a', 'e9b5349046fb00f0bea3427a6ca27bb48b392fbf62df0d0a7dbd7018bb187e26', 'da98f86319ed8ce40500083e68b795a458f4c839787419396a0618da77052856', '04093f4eae7147c52480060aee095f220b936076138f42ef8dc813598b0d3518', '4955ef47401fe31c0188f61ae20fbafeeb31480ce9a8b1825aa2cd48ccda5f6a', 'e4b35f13edf0fba956c078b32448875e2582c21bc93b12dc731c8176acc6b2db', '919eb00b4b2c712d2b8763a01cdee67b6e4fa03da285821cf0762478e7381f56', '999af609347cf00e2607cdb81c0ee9ebf5f4ca326b03514511320ebed46c1621', '015646191d3405710eb09b6a118fee881e5764898e2ee297ef5124b8ab36ed51', 'b2157b0e63b9eee86d6ad20116ff5e96ea9a9a73087c90ce872b291422afcbee', 'a703eecbc1b6443d20c0064f528c92fc9bff76e55e2b3b12fadd2a9726aa9706', '782f9b33c4bf4e0422db3abff91cbdd10df7dc5f47002622cf620e25230156e1']"
286,82,blog_article,https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=82,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,2006-04-30,Scott Aaronson,One down,"Last summer I posed Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory. Today I’m pleased to report that (part of) one of my challenges has been “solved” — where, as always in this business, the word “solved” is defined broadly so as to include “proven to be not really worth working on, since a solution to it would imply a solution to something else that most of us gave up on years ago.”
Challenge 10 involved finding a polynomial-time quantum algorithm to PAC-learn neural networks (that is, the class TC0 of polynomial-size, constant-depth threshold circuits). In a new ECCC preprint, Adam Klivans and Alex Sherstov show that, if there’s a fast quantum algorithm to learn even depth-2 neural nets, then there’s also a fast quantum algorithm for the ~n1.5-approximate shortest vector problem. Embarrassingly for me, once you have the idea — to use Oded Regev’s lattice-based public key cryptosystems — the quantum hardness of learning (say) depth 4 or 5 neural nets is immediate, while getting down to depth 2 takes another page. This is one of those results that hangs in the wonderful balance between “you could’ve thought of that” and “nyah nyah, you didn’t.”

But please, no “spouter challenges” like “where does the power of quantum computing come from?” or “is there a deeper theoretical framework for quantum algorithms?” In general, if you’re going to pose a scientific challenge, you should (1) indicate some technical problem whose solution would clearly represent progress, and (2) be willing to place at least 25% odds on such progress being made within five years. Or if you’re not a gambler, pick technical problems that you yourself intend to solve — that’s the approach I took with Semi-Grand Challenges 4 and 7.
Theoretical computer science is often disheartening: there are so many open problems, and a week later they’re all still open, and a week after that, they’re all still open. Wait a year, though, or five years, or twenty, and some grad student will have had the insight that’s eluded everyone else: that the problem can’t be solved with any existing technique, unless Blum integers are factorable in 2n^ε time for all ε>0.",2220,"['c4182ef524f1dca584bdbd03b2af3963faea6650ec8864d78c81176172b6ae94', 'b93f4609a5d9044c758f8b4954c2512547bb2d051083a1124bc7d3183bad54b0', '8eb873afb8aff658548e1e2781bfb8be143f1fb6f97598849c26c7e26f2e965e', '8a3b38c00b6c8a7a6814a278cd2e88b18a69e4a8cefb9f5abd2b8ce39e6a73d0', 'dc407a4cf60ed1e992b4748c7b8d682dee12727f6956598b257450c6a14f4d6f', '80432e4f4b96783f3987275c1122d50d8d6225420f1d1703549537b7615f2414', 'dc51efda412eb053164ec5b142344500d75999c6fb3b78019593625bf92d86ee', 'dc4dc179903cff932feb6fa82c98acfd25d77454c9dab733e21892dfb7482a06', '19542acc3fd4955963bb4f03767dc78823fb4ef52d17918b19465a6255a3abe1', '1c40da51493bf18d6620e9bceb36227507d08482f763b0c9ddb4a58e9305dd61', '3efa2f8e56d3e4f5b0316d5537e57f44b205ee416cf6d2ed7076d1fa8a0a4a46', 'c610c34bc3a087558a88eec117deb4672ed7349d452dece9ce74d77e955be003', '73ba42930c81813d34351d54ddbf9d783f7a874c47b79d3a5a41726bf3e9def5', '6f752f942aa0910cc9f310198df37ccf5870aa2fae4b651ebc1f82d290f2f826', 'e2f58bb25af1f4b4c807e70930ccd649dbcf791cd4f344b2a1ada060d5bf94fb', 'a60a9647b3eb1e602da9dc0f7b1f894608b52399508a20ccdf63f806d896cab2', '5e86bc9c0723e56015dd8039bb75cb0847a2cef740eb0adf27efead8add1b002', 'f61ab7c0377929a475133cebb0a35b472fd04014bb194021640960716574f3c9', '916f6ff28fb119c247c3bdc144221431366f301d696e2a5b99a3efcbce51d435', 'ea2fc56cd1c34832afc21f00988912c46f39ca6becbba9648bab9d8f3b7ab509', '7c32d564134e0344d721c0edb69f44ae9bc288c626020eb71690ee95655f3ea8', '6364acbddad56548882597ee77717d9f4a4b978566411037ea0e9508b6886214', '4ba3311ec7695e6c2a94e911e76eb4158c79948b156f635a2119f454cb74e990', '7bd1ff092b087a1ba38af713bca91162993945e261245965056546e6cae0e3f4', 'f399f98afde500e968072335e6780253de21304f6bab7b078deab97d8b5ada80', '2315477131430e81fa42aafb0d1154f4065481c7cc01f6539779f0951c043750', '57ad10f23963e0f131e57e1a47e8ff08d3d51c5b2bf867b6e4c382cec743e5be']"

What could possibly be more important to my career — besides napping, web surfing, napping again, or watching Jon Stewart?
So it’s time to come clean: besides my gig at Shtetl-Optimized, I also have a “day job,” most of which is actually performed at night. Greg Kuperberg, who used to be my most regular commenter before he went M.I.A., has a similar “day job.” If you don’t already know what this day job is, it’s a little hard to explain. We barely understand it ourselves. One thing I can say is that it involves the production of documents like the following:
S. Aaronson and G. Kuperberg, Quantum Versus Classical Proofs and Advice, quant-ph/0604056.
This paper studies whether quantum proofs are more powerful than classical proofs, or in complexity terms, whether QMA=QCMA. We prove two results about this question. First, we give a “quantum oracle separation” between QMA and QCMA. More concretely, we show that any quantum algorithm needs Ω(sqrt(2n/(m+1))) queries to find an n-qubit “marked state” |ψ>, even if given an m-bit classical description of |ψ> together with a quantum black box that recognizes |ψ>. We also prove a matching upper bound. Second, we show that, in the one previously-known case where quantum proofs seemed to help, classical proofs are basically just as powerful. In particular, Watrous gave a QMA protocol for verifying non-membership in finite groups. Under plausible group-theoretic assumptions, we give a QCMA protocol for the same problem. Even with no assumptions, our protocol makes only polynomially many queries to the group oracle. Both of our results apply equally to the problem of quantum versus classical advice — that is, of whether BQP/qpoly equals BQP/poly. We end with some conjectures about quantum versus classical oracles, and about the problem of achieving a classical oracle separation between QMA and QCMA.
Alright, suppose you’re King Arthur. Merlin, your staff wizard, claims to have solved a very hard math problem (a “Holy Grail,” so to speak) on which your entire kingdom depends. The problem might involve, say, the speed of an African swallow, or the best kind of oil in which to boil heretics — the details aren’t important.
Being suspicious of wizards, you want to check Merlin’s solution, but being a king, you don’t have much time to do it. You do, however, have a quantum computer at hand (why not?). Here’s the question: is there anything Merlin could convince you of by giving you a quantum-mechanical superposition, that he couldn’t convince you of by just communicating classically?
QMA, which stands for “Quantum Merlin Arthur,” is (basically) the class of problems for which Merlin could feasibly convince you of the answer by giving you a quantum state. QCMA, which stands for “Quantum Classical Merlin Arthur,” is the class of problems for which Merlin could feasibly convince you of the answer by just communicating classically. (Some people have suggested changing the acronym to CMQA, for “Classical Merlin Quantum Arthur,” since Arthur has the quantum computer while Merlin has to communicate classically.)
The key question is whether QMA and QCMA are equal. So, do Greg and I answer that question in our paper? Of course not — are you nuts?! All we do is get closer to answering it than anyone before. We do so by giving two new pieces of evidence: one suggesting that QMA and QCMA are equal, and another suggesting that they’re not. You might not realize it, but this represents Progress.
To those who aren’t “in the business,” all of this medieval quantum intrigue might raise a question: why do we bother? Why do we spend months writing papers that (if we’re lucky) maybe a hundred people will ever be aware of, and ten will ever understand? Well, Greg can answer for himself. As for me, I’ve always liked the answer once given by Bertrand Russell. And no, this isn’t my “serious” or “official” answer (nor was it Bertie’s), but it’s a fine response to anyone who has to ask.
…a word of advice to such of my hearers as may happen to be professors. I am allowed to use plain English because everybody knows that I could use mathematical logic if I chose. Take the statement: “Some people marry their deceased wives’ sisters.” I can express this in language which only becomes intelligible after years of study, and this gives me freedom. I suggest to young professors that their first work should be written in a jargon only to be understood by the erudite few. With that behind them, they can ever after say what they have to say in a language “understanded of the people.”",4656,"['3449076597ae8fc41564a34e78e1c22f6363bd69b2f26e6e437279325a26c0f8', 'a727869ce8f0bdea7686ab1d20477928ce0d1f59c507ce577e79b70fda2e36d1', '1ecac67b35d15a673e5ad620cb163c9e69ad96ef1b22a4013024da8c08860624', '0ce3da3c8d435310e3b1b5b4e7faa0afffd771a0fe19871781a149968897d752', '109f3dfbb9ac80cd786cf8aee5ce0d82c9af9ac0764926b5d80ea56834a9259a', 'fa07b4a81bbc6a7c2224e2c3d93589e8383f670bb7929dd6ea289b8dd2b04982', 'c1141ebfab03aab8995bf1f0a2fe54ac3c7ad10be45000c2c4078885552f7b91', '7df7fbd1ccf5b3e7b8295a4588e698eed01ece2f7d9dbbfd0266bc068f974712', '4557e551a9cb898deac12f6862f1649515c9db8d793114b49566cfde8964d79e', '3db192c0128b73bef2e72bebb5e759019b66f4363e502cd351448b463e7def41', '8f834318841b43379ecc98f2d19d70d04904eba8a93079d5fba69120e27b6d64', 'd9e706e139f78aa6c59bde67ff623e32e40f8efa7758d51ad6e3655e48e56c41', '4b0e02cef987e41540ec133aea81502225eaf0c8c23633755f377765fe17f176', 'c3066104ad3f0710da5690ec262852a41720798c2d8409c977b313d9eb407a73', '3f02fc29b063bc80429de7e698ebe483c6c65a0f7a12f0e5b66931421cf45b94', '4b9c8d8c96a7471476571acaa391a7a76147b12705bd35ca221edbcfbe3cff35', '0e22c3ad45bd406b1a6fff56544cd3908651c3d017992e0907acc65c74e5ba54', 'bc7b86f85f8e0f59ac0738984abf166a1bce8aaefd36c2ff810e50e007e68266', 'a7daf98bc875f9214a01b70a20c76f945bb77d802bdd2cbbeb229b0196543db2', '294df833a82ecb0c6a31c71a6eea6cb2a49d6e8c76a696bd2f773e3767a399ba', '6c5f82dc4de5d2d0d910b0e32179c02e9d930a06483c4263ffaac272be89595c', '5653c8d8f5e852f535c8e70c3bbcdadcac0d34bdf7b4e5f2a13a2c8c45950580', '61d96fab7aa1b4f51c695fc3d1929810fb931d4924854fabc687ce5477095ae2', '2cdd02fd82c684eab26a466d6f54184a62c28116783a12849847c3b46dbc8d48', 'fa30155323ad8ed1398b6571be2400ce83b69f30e7b02debcfc0be0e4879d3a3', '4b7ed5d70e8f12d001e6004eab6e62803bd05dfa41a627d02111cb6269987938', '6972987b17b25ac7c5a57c7a5c39f7a02f79e8f05424c3958f2ef26c644cd0d6', '49920ddabd9686d24ce81faac14257af17ed997d5562f530c06e6c904ee6e8e3', 'de2c4151076c8a8102385cbabb0b032241101dd75d0f509755c94b52a879ee0f', '230009a003ae4a7a6f72252dfe4d90e51903c2159d389adfdbb547386fcf134a', '8efab99b1b9b11f2cabac11e93428e6aba54dce072d512311cb2d5bc996b0b4c', '9faa0104703ed7d43202451e2a8e3cb336fd97510752ec83070c21c62e040f00', '2a2ea73ae5c432063945d45b9525c3f0a9a8c24209744f2366c2cd762e9460ae', '60ff9cdc648d0178a61673aa3f6eb42edfebe8e6feb5dbd0de1c3b2215e7ff99', '8a652a88a307b89c7d262f4b91069ff10d3f198b7f99e803eb1e3b8e51aa33b7', 'be1f2337d982508c82ac1f207962bb8d84383360419bd97e558765e430fe7aa0', '6305bbe593c4aecba35f9496c2829b2d196782e5c7c33575a8141b8dfadf2237', '732fccc7811deab5416de22e3813d6f55d4d85e41d1d28214556d8a63d414447', '89bdaa61683ce5eae7c9f1145aaca2b04262d1f96d00102d90cfb78b8fef8022', '890e26acaf234a7b461b5ce273ca4ed7a9ed3d52b76754c1ae7c9ac2e6f05346', 'aa76708b9577a2f1ab8a444b03acf723829baf090eac21a0910e39d237738169', '4e71f99bbfc3242276eec0bf427999f17fc2f48467b1c7e9e0100c097e517289', 'a7a93cfdbeeb489f9e257aa012080b75f60856f9efd6366baf0f3b07cbea4aea']"

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — By combining quantum computation and quantum interrogation, scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have found an exotic way of determining an answer to an algorithm — without ever running the algorithm.
Using an optical-based quantum computer, a research team led by physicist Paul Kwiat has presented the first demonstration of “counterfactual computation,” inferring information about an answer, even though the computer did not run.
Readers, my sole ambition in life, outside the purely personal, is to prevent stuff like this from being spouted.
I’m serious. You see, I have no “philosophy” to offer the world, no unifying theory, no startling new idea. All I have is a long howl of rage, which admittedly tends to take the form of STOC/FOCS papers. But if you read those papers, you’ll see that almost every one of them was born when I came across some specific claim and said, “No. Dammit. No. That can’t possibly be right.”
Look — if you tell a layperson that a computer has solved a problem without ever having been switched on, then not only have you not explained anything, you haven’t even asserted anything. All you’ve done is pose a question: namely, “what’s the catch?”
In this case, the catch is simple. Say you’ve got two programs, Dif and Doof, running in the Windows taskbar. Dif is performing some enormous calculation, while Doof (being a Doof) is doing nothing. If Dif’s calculation returns any answer other than 5, then Dif closes Doof. You come back to your computer and find that Doof is still running. Even though Doof didn’t calculate anything, and even though Dif never did anything to Doof, you can immediately conclude — from Doof alone — that the answer you wanted was 5. Mindblowing! Unbelievable!
Now let Dif and Doof run, not in different windows, but in different branches of the wavefunction — that is, in quantum superposition. And instead of Dif using an operating system to close Doof, have Dif’s branch of the wavefunction interfere destructively with Doof’s branch, thereby preventing Doof’s branch from being observed. That’s the idea of counterfactual quantum computing.
I suppose this is “mysterious,” in the same way that a dog claiming to hate doggie-treats would be mysterious. In the former case, the mystery is quantum mechanics. In the latter case, the mystery is a talking dog.
Having said that, the original paper by Jozsa and Mitchison is actually lovely and well worth reading. It proves some nontrivial results about limits of counterfactual computing, and it also gives a good introduction to the Vaidman bomb (which I think of as a precursor to Grover’s algorithm).
I’ll end with the clearest account of counterfactual computing I’ve seen, courtesy of one Homer J. Simpson.

“Rabbit Hole” is a rehash of the 2004 film “What the Bleep Do We Know!?”; apparently the new version is longer and includes more crackpots, but the basic howlers are the same. (Woit’s summary: “entanglement=we are all connected, superposition=anything you want to be true is true.”)

ME: …so, at least in the black-box model that we can analyze, my result implies that the quantum speedup for breaking cryptographic hash functions is only a polynomial one, as opposed to the exponential speedup of Shor’s factoring algorithm.
PERSON AT COCKTAIL PARTY: How interesting! It’s just like they were saying in the movie: reality is merely a construct of our minds.
But if I do jump down the Rabbit Hole, my worry is that I won’t make it through:
“Sir, if you don’t stop causing a disturbance, we’ll have to escort you out of the movie theater…”
“BUT YOU CAN’T USE QUANTUM MECHANICS TO CHANNEL DEAD PEOPLE! IT’S A LINEAR THEORY! POSTSELECTION’S NOT ALLOWED!”
“Alright, come with us, sir.”
“LINEAR, I TELL YOU! AND THE MEASUREMENTS OBEY THE |Ψ|2 RULE! WHAT THE %*#()$*$ DO THESE IDIOTS KNOW!? I’M BEGGING YOU, STOP THE PROJECTOR!”
Since this hasn’t yet happened, what inspired the present post was not the movie itself, but its title graphic:
Staring at this image, I came up with something that I call the Cringeometer: a quick way for anyone, scientist or not, to predict whether a given popular depiction of science will cause scientists to cringe. To use the Cringeometer, you don’t have to make any decisions about technical accuracy. All you have to do is look for mathematical symbols such as Σ, ε, and π, and then ask yourself two questions:
- Are the symbols used to create an aura of profundity and unintelligibility, without regard for their meaning — more or less like Christmas tree ornaments?
- If so, is the effect humorous?
The results should be self-explanatory — but just in case they aren’t, I’ll end with three sample applications of the Cringeometer.
- “What the Bleep?” explodes the Cringeometer even before the movie has started.
- NUMB3RS also sets the Cringeometer off, even though it probably does more good than harm for public math appreciation. This illustrates that the Cringeometer can’t predict scientists’ detailed opinions — only the involuntary, physical reaction of cringing.
- “The Far Side” cartoons never set the Cringeometer off.",2829,"['29baa0bb5d5cea7da3c18ff5ac0c41a3aba615354ac933081f62fb051d743380', 'ca5de6718180bd1b5f24e00c6521e87aa5bc6ac997c00dbb07959ea7ebdfc0ad', '4c526aa025ad7ba815d8af69ae5e8c402da4bda1a9461063055bb98518995148', '053fce86f7e2c5db1274b64e27a64b858691aafd50cb1e262ba460e4df1036a0', 'c8bfe9df9418a2820dddc555ff914ea29adf6e9b6309fc782b2a3d8a65db6b3a', '6619a406ba544e8872e3e0c35cd90c9bae872191790ba91223340a33766be646', '47d21de2f2f55e538ff137055296e55f32ee856a1f6fe33333fdc8813517a63d', 'b8abecdd6ec4e0c7716074cde7bba7564672dfdf000ea14912a8c9a93be0ba92', '2d49ece2a8580656d798ecc3d7963a4672e025a9feff4763ebd099f74e1a9441', '50505f524e8924262ff112c2150ae4e7c7741835291dad87acb5a579d694e84f', '1a7217950705791978a21e6bc46e856f9c39d9bb9481df27681a944b99ba544a', '50d374b197575fbef3c77fcee402aad2d34d1c2a0e2ef91d66809981158cdb4f', '9cffd2c58f6ab9407f14c2b2e11211282c1297fe18231badd3cec36e6a4bcb1c', '94100ed55ba1e7317461a97b5f2b3611775547be070b632f545c6345d602243f', 'f7bf1bdd2fd6bfa1068c3cbd3fbf949f6e41f82d0ed26d6c2c02f53a63355427', '36cf57ef3a11666dd23f4bbed5fddf14e61adb7a7cd6f2df8367beb59d0bdee1', '7b8286e4b6eb5f6dc0c6c2105a1235ef40bc50808128256f4b33d60042166620', '5320ead97171ad470575fbad1de2370d314cc9474d3437593cc38f7a3947bfd2', 'da14f3f774f223323eef71f5bbbe7d65e7018fd2991a786dc42abb5007e318d3', '00333e5f76bc69883f9395a4aedccfc8344ac1a577a17c2af11b7ca2d76ef04d', '24fdb8603e01827f70439823cd639808217c56f9e06b0171a88f9abbd6a0843f', '3d4a7d448d6da78b89885320e01844bff5881695a9ba23066d20fdb8d4283313', '65b06f86ccd3b35658046da7224f84840112cdc69fbb8b7cfe7a31de8fda113a', 'b5e6e95ed57adc701a76645bb4c7e68a5a204d16bf7baf4627e674000d9d4cc4', '10d7142b8dde21f8dfe33d966f98d6dc01d95b617dfee4798ca3cf6536d6ce0e', '5bb39be2c65d9970515093ec839c980b44e7b9848e73d684243c4822c794bf89', 'c93c04e1849384709840de51f7d3f4514c49e17a5a51056bd2b92d40302afc24', '69683e3e7ce9428ca29164e4939b1f605afdb964ea35656589d34f80cc2cbda9', 'a6acb53121f654a4d95ccf84838944bdfa63d0e708055881b12425e064425ecd', 'f4829493730ea886c570e79934e43f73541039bf5813d8b13664851971e88134', 'eeda8a47234b4a75834c74ca65566801e8636d49dec8fcfacf0867d44deb8233', '0dec3522c32301df6dd257acd9888c8bd2c9c63a4622647a51998a99f54a11b6', '20c3fddf5b98eb9bc355d2a47898a5795bde53b90ded8cdc2c858ea7a1a9304e', '3700ab02bb08dff02b6298e08bf914e45396ab13e82ed00835701d14bbbe1cb8', 'fb544aee5732cf6554e5cc09c29311100b55b11c348b3140a7034f303f91561f', 'c7e1dddcc0c5a5b3ccb3cf6d0d32214a4ccd5174cc50a590f11c3c7765a3eb30', '2fc75d3e19b6abba0db4355621846727bb8d3203a759605279c0de4e546ad7c3', '26e3399794ab1525f338ee85df2dfd318c0df0c1fe59f26c0021129556061d36', '3b8641d37fd23324feae847e79f7d79f4358cc6a1a1fc105c59744ee09832e29', 'b89e85fa02d980b00f9dd6354a2e3e2ca4ec643b56e7535b83bedabda3a2f3f8', '76eabfa1f2820ce002b463802e33b9d557e3fe8e720b2e58f4a062f8fae770d7', '5d5d0c39aa670e26745aba3e0a09537fb9891b5f06a4c7b6dbc263e5dc626bb9', '674d1d51fb19d5f98711036fc5b33011d6681940c9ed809a7df870d0e0b819c3', '31768f5a323af5abf263755844e590603db5799f7a653ea35a1da8fceedab542', '04ca8a66a821f45b960b2e428a5972b7056f52d38381b27d4d3754d3dc0abfa5', 'baefa875923c4f71b4eccd0978e34d44b09f5ca8852d81a6524342d33ac529a2', 'b8fa9e7a403423c90fc97e9afaa4b884a477757e9b01bf294983c1b85906cbbe', '7d02431fda311b4dd19718a597afca018e0073636f913152a466602aa9a88921', 'c94fa50f8f6b1f972a92c6cb0fbc12761e237297d301cd8d2548fe730f014b35', 'ac87c5eb89e544e7efd785ae7f60c8f1332968f0a99346f64beff8063d960a2e', '75621b586092c54c5358e5559eb8cb3cf08cb73130b271029c042e41c6d14f25', '923aaf584d67a4091437dc4d1c890e51f58b2b0f6a37ca3abe00fa915362c7cf', 'dae50503517e2ea2fb11588100f7800e32928b36b504977a128914e5accb7574', 'c3428b259e668801cea7e2c6f8ebf053f3d2bdb1309b071cabfc6c882cd77ff4']"
