His Twilight Zone was a dimension of imagination, a dimension of sight and sound and mind, a dimension as vast as space and timeless as infinity. It was all very clear except for the space and time part, the dimensions of real life. Serling never explained them.
Of course, ever since Einstein, scientists have also been scratching their heads about how to make sense of space and time. Before then, almost everybody thought Isaac Newton had figured it all out. Time “flows equably without relation to anything external,” he declared. Absolute space is also its own thing, “always similar and immovable.” Nothing to see there. Events of physical reality performed independently on a neutral stage where actors strutted and fretted without influencing the rest of the theater.
But Einstein’s theories turned Newton’s absolute space and time into a relativistic mash-up — his equations suggested a merged space-time, a new sort of arena in which the players altered the space of the playing field. It was a physics game changer. No longer did space and time provide a featureless backdrop for matter and energy. Formerly independent and uniform, space and time became inseparable and variable. And as Einstein showed in his general theory of relativity, matter and energy warped the space-time surrounding them. That simple (hah!) truth explained gravity. Newton’s apparent force of attraction became an illusion perpetrated by space-time geometry. It was the shape of space-time that dictated the motion of massive bodies, a symmetric justice since massive bodies determined space-time’s shape.
Verification of Einstein’s space-time revolution came a century ago, when an eclipse expedition confirmed his general theory’s prime prediction (a precise amount of bending of light passing near the edge of a massive body, in this case the Sun). But space-time remained mysterious. Since it was something rather than nothing, it was natural to wonder where it came from.
Now a new revolution is on the verge of answering that question, based on insights from the other great physics surprise of the last century: quantum mechanics. Today’s revolution offers the potential for yet another rewrite of space-time’s résumé, with the bonus of perhaps explaining why quantum mechanics seems so weird.
“Space-time and gravity must ultimately emerge from something else,” writes physicist Brian Swingle in the 2018 Annual Review of Condensed Matter Physics. Otherwise it’s hard to see how Einstein’s gravity and the math of quantum mechanics can reconcile their longstanding incompatibility. Einstein’s view of gravity as the manifestation of space-time geometry has been enormously successful. But so also has been quantum mechanics, which describes the machinations of matter and energy on the atomic scale with unerring accuracy. Attempts to find coherent math that accommodates quantum weirdness with geometric gravity, though, have met formidable technical and conceptual roadblocks.
At least that has long been so for attempts to understand ordinary space-time. But clues to a possible path to progress have emerged from the theoretical study of alternate space-time geometries, thinkable in principle but with unusual properties. One such alternate, known as anti de Sitter space, is weirdly curved and tends to collapse on itself, rather than expanding as the universe we live in does. It wouldn’t be a nice place to live. But as a laboratory for studying theories of quantum gravity, it has a lot to offer. “Quantum gravity is sufficiently rich and confusing that even toy universes can shed enormous light on the physics,” writes Swingle, of the University of Maryland.";3704;['emuloob', 'emuu6j3', 'emue9h4', 'emuc29x', 'emuulyt', 'emus7b6', 'emulp59', 'emukv9l', 'emuvwz3', 'emuops1', 'emunk1z', 'emumaxo',

Astrophysicist at Göttingen University discovers new theoretical hyper-fast soliton solutions
If travel to distant stars within an individual’s lifetime is going to be possible, a means of faster-than-light propulsion will have to be found. To date, even recent research about superluminal (faster-than-light) transport based on Einstein’s theory of general relativity would require vast amounts of hypothetical particles and states of matter that have “exotic” physical properties such as negative energy density. This type of matter either cannot currently be found or cannot be manufactured in viable quantities. In contrast, new research carried out at the University of Göttingen gets around this problem by constructing a new class of hyper-fast ‘solitons’ using sources with only positive energies that can enable travel at any speed. This reignites debate about the possibility of faster-than-light travel based on conventional physics. The research is published in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity.
The author of the paper, Dr Erik Lentz, analysed existing research and discovered gaps in previous ‘warp drive’ studies. Lentz noticed that there existed yet-to-be explored configurations of space-time curvature organized into ‘solitons’ that have the potential to solve the puzzle while being physically viable. A soliton – in this context also informally referred to as a 'warp bubble’ – is a compact wave that maintains its shape and moves at constant velocity. Lentz derived the Einstein equations for unexplored soliton configurations (where the space-time metric’s shift vector components obey a hyperbolic relation), finding that the altered space-time geometries could be formed in a way that worked even with conventional energy sources. In essence, the new method uses the very structure of space and time arranged in a soliton to provide a solution to faster-than-light travel, which – unlike other research – would only need sources with positive energy densities. No “exotic” negative energy densities needed.
If sufficient energy could be generated, the equations used in this research would allow space travel to Proxima Centauri, our nearest star, and back to Earth in years instead of decades or millennia. That means an individual could travel there and back within their lifetime. In comparison, the current rocket technology would take more than 50,000 years for a one-way journey. In addition, the solitons (warp bubbles) were configured to contain a region with minimal tidal forces such that the passing of time inside the soliton matches the time outside: an ideal environment for a spacecraft. This means there would not be the complications of the so-called “twin paradox” whereby one twin travelling near the speed of light would age much more slowly than the other twin who stayed on Earth: in fact, according to the recent equations both twins would be the same age when reunited.
“This work has moved the problem of faster-than-light travel one step away from theoretical research in fundamental physics and closer to engineering. The next step is to figure out how to bring down the astronomical amount of energy needed to within the range of today's technologies, such as a large modern nuclear fission power plant. Then we can talk about building the first prototypes,"" says Lentz.
Currently, the amount of energy required for this new type of space propulsion drive is still immense. Lentz explains, “The energy required for this drive travelling at light speed encompassing a spacecraft of 100 meters in radius is on the order of hundreds of times of the mass of the planet Jupiter. The energy savings would need to be drastic, of approximately 30 orders of magnitude to be in range of modern nuclear fission reactors.” He goes on to say: “Fortunately, several energy-saving mechanisms have been proposed in earlier research that can potentially lower the energy required by nearly 60 orders of magnitude.” Lentz is currently in the early-stages of determining if these methods can be modified, or if new mechanisms are needed to bring the energy required down to what is currently possible.";4213;['gqdk5s0', 'gqegv3w', 'gqe72ml', 'gqel76g', 'gqenq71', 'gqefltu', 'gqemeq2', 'gqf8wmx', 'gqeh7nh', 'gqevrhl', 'gqedy7b', 'gqem4mp', 'gqesw1j', 'gqetlib', 'gqdvqeu', 'gqedepk', 'gqdykt7', 'gqeocsv', 'gqdvpb1', 'gqecn4u', 'gqdzeym', 'gqeo77a', 'gqemdyw', 'gqeqgcw', 'gqeu2v2', 'gqek75n', 'gqeddex', 'gqf2ynq', 'gqfnpvh', 'gqerpyh', 'gqemjok', 'gqekuxy', 'gqen8c1', 'gqetd4c', 'gqf1y55', 'gqf5by4', 'gqf66xp', 'gqfagvi', 'gqfeqmf', 'gqff4un', 'gqfhs5a', 'gqfko8a', 'gqfmk05', 'gqfnocc', 'gqfwmzt', 'gqg2yoh', 'gqgmexz', 'gqgnkzv', 'grkpwou', 'gqe6gvq', 'gqeer6c', 'gqel34i', 'gqeocmn', 'gqfkca6', 'gqecg2g', 'gqe0hf1', 'gqeitbe', 'gqeh8f9', 'gqeohcz', 'gqeptwf', 'gqespui', 'gqff04j', 'gqgisgk', 'gqhd58p', 'gqeqr7p', 'gqexdb4', 'gqf07c0', 'gqf0u16', 'gqftk4m', 'gqfw1ss', 'gqgeqrb', 'gqekv34', 'gqew9i1', 'gqf1mag', 'gqfk1co', 'gqem9q8', 'gqeo3qo', 'gqetzph', 'gqf5v29', 'gqee7wc', 'gqemqnh', 'gqemwaf', 'gqeoi6p', 'gqeoy2y', 'gqeq8gp', 'gqer7f5', 'gqerk33', 'gqes6ty', 'gqes7az', 'gqesjop', 'gqeskas', 'gqetr8e', 'gqeucm7', 'gqeul6v', 'gqev0cy', 'gqev133', 'gqevhkh', 'gqewimv', 'gqewmxx', 'gqex4rp', 'gqexmjm', 'gqexnk8', 'gqeymo7', 'gqeyzzb', 'gqez52v', 'gqez9uj', 'gqezkxs', 'gqezyfb', 'gqf059d', 'gqf07ah', 'gqf0ua5', 'gqf13rv', 'gqf1lng', 'gqf1q99', 'gqf1sgl', 'gqf1xhg', 'gqf2cia', 'gqf2gg6', 'gqf2hbv', 'gqf35v2', 'gqf3aaa', 'gqf460n', 'gqf4ea5', 'gqf5ggz', 'gqf5x5v', 'gqf6c0j', 'gqf6os6', 'gqf74wb', 'gqf90um', 'gqf9nq4', 'gqf9r6a', 'gqfaskl', 'gqfbcfg', 'gqfbezz', 'gqfbk3p', 'gqfcajr', 'gqfco58', 'gqfcynm', 'gqfd42a', 'gqfdyh1', 'gqfe2fp', 'gqfeqwx', 'gqfexdt', 'gqffcri', 'gqffkq6', 'gqffn8i', 'gqffnmq', 'gqfg2bi', 'gqfgn85', 'gqfi0n7', 'gqfj9u7', 'gqfk1cd', 'gqfk6ph', 'gqfkqtc', 'gqfkzi3', 'gqfljqq', 'gqfm626', 'gqfn0fs', 'gqfnjhp', 'gqfq1us', 'gqfqpr7', 'gqfqxrx', 'gqfr6np', 'gqfsg6k', 'gqfsx95', 'gqft00v', 'gqft8di', 'gqfthi9', 'gqftq7e', 'gqftr1r', 'gqftyf8', 'gqfuqhi', 'gqfw0u2', 'gqfwevi', 'gqfwgqe', 'gqfwriz', 'gqfwzya', 'gqfxkc8', 'gqfz037', 'gqg04iu', 'gqg0tp0', 'gqg1gaz', 'gqg210d', 'gqg4gxi', 'gqg4jeh', 'gqg5n1p', 'gqg5oi6', 'gqg6hah', 'gqg74b9', 'gqg863d', 'gqg8wvd', 'gqgadpd', 'gqgbnva', 'gqgd5l6', 'gqge965', 'gqghoth', 'gqgj047', 'gqgjbzs', 'gqgk2z0', 'gqgpwhn', 'gqgqe3j', 'gqgrhlp', 'gqgrli3', 'gqgvfpi', 'gqh0fv7', 'gqh0y7e', 'gqhha3f', 'gqi26vd', 'gs27sjb'];209;1

Now, a team of researchers has put together a mathematical model showing aliens could potentially be communicating across space – via quantum physics.
Efforts are well underway to make quantum communications a reality here on Earth. The idea is that quantum mechanics provide certain properties that would make information transfer inherently faster and more secure than regular systems… if we can get it to work.
One of the major hurdles to overcome before quantum networks can be established is that they're very fragile and susceptible to interference. According to this latest study, such networks could fly across space without breaking up.
""Quantum states you generally think of as very delicate, and if there's any kind of external interaction, you kind of destroy that state,"" lead author of the research, theoretical physicist Arjun Berera from the University of Edinburgh in the UK, told Science News.
Berera and his colleague Jaime Calderón-Figueroa, a fellow theoretical physicist at the University of Edinburgh, ran calculations on the movement of X-rays across the emptiness of space to check for potential decoherence (the breaking up of the quantum state).
If photons – particles of light – were used as the quantum particles, the researchers determined, they could be beamed across hundreds of thousands of light-years at least, a greater stretch of distance than the entire Milky Way galaxy.
That's partly because the average density of matter in space is much less than it is on Earth, and this 'cleaner' environment means less chance of interference. Even gravitational pulls wouldn't be enough to knock a quantum communication network off course.
""It is plausible that quantum communication mediated by photons could be established across interstellar distances, in particular for photons in the X-ray region below the electron mass,"" write the researchers in their published paper.
That alien life forms might be using quantum networks to speak to each other or to try and get in touch with us is, of course, pure speculation – but at the same time it gives astronomers another potential sign of life they can monitor for.
The ""considerable information transfer"" possible with a quantum signal would make it attractive to any extraterrestrial intelligence out there in the cosmos, the researchers say, though it may require a fully functioning quantum computer in order to decode it.
And even quantum communication isn't magic: Information still can't travel faster than the speed of light, so transmissions may take several years to reach their destinations.
Based on these findings, we can now add quantum communication as well as classical communication to the possible ways aliens might be chatting with each other – or perhaps might be trying to make themselves known to us.

Faster than light, 10,000 times faster.
That's what a team of physicists led by Juan Yin at the University of Science and Technology of China in Shanghai found in an experiment involving entangled photons, or photons that remain intimately connected, even when separated by vast distances.They wanted to see what would happen if you tried assigning a speed to what Einstein called ""spooky action at a distance.""
They didn't find anything unexpected, but that wasn't the point: in physics, sometimes it's good to be sure. The group published their work on the ArXiv.org, a preprint server for physics papers.
All tangled up
Quantum physicists have long known that after two particles — photons, for example — interact, they sometimes become ""entangled."" This kind of experiment has been repeated many times, and involves taking two entangled photons and sending them to different places. Perhaps photon A goes to Los Angeles and photon B goes to Boston.
When photon A is observed, it has a certain polarization, perhaps ""up."" The other photon in Boston is always in the opposite polarization, ""down."" No matter what measurement is made of photon A, photon B will always be opposite. It is impossible to tell what the polarization will be before you measure it, but the entangled photons always seem to ""know"" the right state to be in, instantaneously. [Twisted Physics: 7 Mind-Blowing Findings]
As Chad Orzel, assistant professor of physics at Union College, explained, ""It's as though you sent two cards to two different addresses. One might be the jack of diamonds and the other the ace of hearts. When you get the card at one address you know which one went to the other. Quantum mechanics is weird because until you open the envelope, saying which card it is doesn't have any meaning; it could be either one.""
Speed of quantum interaction
This is what Albert Einstein called ""spooky action at a distance."" And the correlation between the photons' states seems to happen instantaneously. But what does ""instantaneous"" really mean? That's part of what the Chinese team wanted to look at.
So the researchers entangled two photons and sent them to two different stations about 10 miles (16 kilometers) apart. In their ArXiv paper, the scientists said that previous experiments had ""locality loopholes,"" which is another way of saying that it's possible to explain the link between photons with something other than the ""action at a distance.""
The group measured the state of one photon and timed how long the entangled state took to show up in the other. They found that the slowest possible speed for quantum interactions is 10,000 times the speed of light — assuming your experiment is moving relatively slowly, at least relative to light beams.
Whereas the result may sound like a way to send faster-than-light messages, it isn't, really, because you can't know the state of the entangled photon pair before it's measured; so there's no way to control it and make the photon at the other end take on certain states and use it like a Morse code telegraph. [10 Implications of Faster-Than-Light Travel]
This type of experiment has been done before, notably by a European team, in 2008. So why do it again? Many physics experiments are performed to check more closely the values of constants used in equations, for instance, which enable more precise measurements in other areas.
Orzel said that even if it turned out that there was some small amount of time it takes for the state of a photon to change (meaning it's not instantaneous), it isn't clear that lag would mean much for quantum physics generally. That's because there are several interpretations for why quantum phenomena happen the way they do, and all explain the experimental results equally well. Physicists aren't even certain that there's an experiment one could do to tell the difference.
He added that it is extremely unlikely that anyone will ever get an ""exact"" value for the speed of such quantum interactions, and, in fact, modern physics prohibits that kind of finding in principle. But it is useful to see what the limits are — to clarify what we mean when we say ""instantaneous.""
""There's a certain strain of physics that people that will say it has to be instantaneous – in fact, if it is faster than light it mustbe instantaneous,"" Orzel said. ""So if you can put a limit on it that is kind of cool.""";4433;['c956z3f', 'c9570m0', 'c957ab3', 'c95eq6i', 'c95772w', 'c957yze', 'c9574ex', 'c9576il', 'c95732k', 'c9577bm', 'c9578e9', 'c95799m', 'c95derr', 'c957ey0', 'c957jdj', 'c95ak77', 'c95cccc', 'c95ckaq', 'c95pl2u', 'c957dj0', 'c9589ca', 'c958dw8', 'c956yjq', 'c9579nt', 'c957i7q', 'c957ltx', 'c957ng7', 'c957orl', 'c9585gg', 'c9585v1', 'c9589r8', 'c958b1l', 'c958ld8', 'c958o3e', 'c958tmw', 'c958zqf', 'c9590cg', 'c959c49', 'c959das', 'c959dz2', 'c959l5d', 'c959o38', 'c959or3', 'c959ovo', 'c959soc', 'c959tum', 'c959woq', 'c959y9t', 'c95a066', 'c95a3vj', 'c95a9qg', 'c95af13', 'c95aial', 'c95amns', 'c95aq9g', 'c95aqlk', 'c95aquc', 'c95b502', 'c95b5ny', 'c95b75p', 'c95bkqy', 'c95bmlk', 'c95bnsj', 'c95bpk5', 'c95c09l', 'c95c0u6', 'c95c248', 'c95c2n6', 'c95c9v2', 'c95cddz', 'c95cf8g', 'c95chs5', 'c95cmz6', 'c95cnnj', 'c95coao', 'c95czex', 'c95ddtk', 'c95dhec', 'c95dkmo', 'c95dpnn', 'c95dvu3', 'c95dvzo', 'c95dwe9', 'c95dyb1', 'c95e7bv', 'c95eh4r', 'c968u7b', 'c9afrv9', 'c957x1p', 'c958cu0', 'c9579tl', 'c957zgo', 'c958a72', 'c95alev', 'c95dkdt', 'c95kmfh', 'c956zum', 'c957asb', 'c957tqj', 'c958beg', 'c95742j', 'c957qsg', 'c957coi', 'c957j2j', 'c957mrj', 'c957o91', 'c957opn', 'c957u3k', 'c957vs8', 'c957wh8', 'c957yv4', 'c9582og', 'c9582yl', 'c95839m', 'c9583hv', 'c95868y', 'c958lvq', 'c958q16', 'c9590ha', 'c959afc', 'c95aqdr', 'c95bfmf', 'c95bk7o', 'c95bry0', 'c95czgj', 'c95d07f', 'c95dnwb', 'c95doay', 'c95drcu', 'c95ejqy', 'c95evp2', 'c95ew9g', 'c95ezyc', 'c95fde1', 'c95fqiw', 'c95fvue', 'c95gx6r', 'c95h0qd', 'c95h0yh', 'c95hp27', 'c95hrtz', 'c95i24s', 'c95i8oy', 'c95j2bw', 'c95jf4n', 'c95khp4', 'c95l1nu', 'c95l3w3', 'c957l3t', 'c957o7m', 'c957o8e', 'c9580rj', 'c958a0r', 'c958n1k', 'c958oxk', 'c958x08', 'c958zo8', 'c959haq', 'c959xfu', 'c95av49', 'c95bb4h', 'c95fsbc', 'c95g5or', 'c95goqf', 'c95juet', 'c95kco3', 'c95kv0w', 'c957r59', 'c9588tr', 'c958pec', 'c959fj1', 'c95b45v', 'c957b6c', 'c958to5', 'c9595bn', 'c95al2i', 'c95dg9c', 'c95hgyv'];178;1

Quick: what’s 4 + 5? Nine right? Slightly less quick: what’s five plus four? Still nine, right?
Okay, let’s wait a few seconds. Bear with me. Feel free to have a quick stretch.
Now, without looking, what was the answer to the first question?
It’s still nine, isn’t it?
You’ve just performed a series of advanced brain functions. You did math based on prompts designed to appeal to entirely different parts of your brain and you displayed the ability to recall previous information when queried later. Great job!
This might seem like old hat to most of us, but it’s actually quite an amazing feat of brain power.
And, based on some recent research by a pair of teams from the University of Bonn and the University of Tübingen, these simple processes could indicate that you’re a quantum computer.
Let’s do the math
Your brain probably isn’t wired for numbers. It’s great at math, but numbers are a relatively new concept for humans.
Numbers showed up in human history approximately 6,000 years ago with the Mesopotamians, but our species has been around for about 300,000 years.
Prehistoric humans still had things to count. They didn’t randomly forget how many children they had just because there wasn’t a bespoke language for numerals yet.
Instead, they found other methods for expressing quantities or tracking objects such as holding up their fingers or using representative models.
If you had to keep track of dozens of cave-mates, for example, you might carry a pebble to represent each one. As people trickled in from a hard day of hunting, gathering, and whatnot, you could shift the pebbles from one container to another as an accounting method.
It might seem sub-optimal, but the human brain really doesn’t care whether you use numbers, words, or concepts when it comes to math.
Let’s do the research
The aforementioned research teams recently published a fascinating paper titled “Neuronal codes for arithmetic rule processing in the human brain.”
As the title intimates, the researchers identified an abstract code for processing addition and subtraction inside the human brain. This is significant because we really don’t know how the brain handles math.
You can’t just slap some electrodes on someone’s scalp or stick them in a CAT scan machine to suss out the nature of human calculation.
Math happens at the individual neuron level inside the human brain. EKG readings and CAT scans can only provide a general picture of all the noise our neurons produce.
And, as there are some 86 billion neurons making noise inside our heads, those kinds of readings aren’t what you’d call an “exact science.”
The Bonn and Tübingen teams got around this problem by conducting their research on volunteers who already had subcranial electrode implants for the treatment of epilepsy.
Nine volunteers met the study’s criteria and, because of the nature of their implants, they were able to provide what might be the world’s first glimpse into how the brain actually handles math.
Per the research paper:
    We found abstract and notation-independent codes for addition and subtraction in neuronal populations.
    Decoders applied to time-resolved recordings demonstrate a static code in hippocampus based on persistently rule-selective neurons, in contrast to a dynamic code in parahippocampal cortex originating from neurons carrying rapidly changing rule information.
An image of single neuron activity
Single neurons across multiple brain sectors responding to different encoded rules for math.
Basically, the researchers saw that different parts of the brain light up when we do addition than when we do subtraction. They also discovered that different parts of the brain approach these tasks with different timing.
It’s a bit complex, but the gist of it is that one part of our brain tries to figure out the problem while another works on a solution.
As the researchers put it:
    Neuron recordings in human and nonhuman primates, as well as computational modeling, suggest different cognitive functions for these two codes for working memory: although a dynamic code seems to suffice for short maintenance of more implicit information in memory, the intense mental manipulation of the attended working memory contents may require a static code.
    Following this logic, parahippocampal cortex may represent a short-term memory of the arithmetic rule, whereas downstream hippocampus may “do the math” and process numbers according to the arithmetic rule at hand.
Let’s take inventory
So far we’ve learned that every math process requires both a hard-coded memory solution (a static rule) and a novel one (a dynamic rule). And each of those is transient based on what kind of arithmetic we’re performing.
Keeping in mind that there are 86 billion neurons in the human brain, and that something as basic as simple arithmetic appears to be hidden across all or most of them, it’s obvious there’s something more complex than simple pebble-counting going on.
Per the paper:
    Mental calculation is a classic working memory task, and although working memory has traditionally been attributed to the prefrontal cortex, more recent data suggest that the MTL may also be important in working memory tasks and that it is part of a brain-wide network subserving working memory.
Either our brains are working extra-hard to do simple binary mathematics or they’re quantum computing systems doing what they do best: hallucinating answers.
The art of math
Think about an apple. No, not that one. Think about a green apple. How many calculations did it take for you to arrive at a specific apple density and relative size? Did you have to adjust the input variables in order to produce an apple that wasn’t red?
I’m going to go out on a limb and say you didn’t. You just thought about some apples and they happened inside your head. You hallucinated those apples.
Artificial intelligence systems designed to produce original content based on learned styles go through the exact same process.
These AI systems aren’t using advanced math features to psychologically exploit the human propensity for art or imagery. They’re just following some simple rules and swirling data around until they spit out something their creators will reward them for.
That’s kind of how your brain does math. At least according to this new research, anyway. It uses rules to surface the answer that makes the most sense. There’s a part that tries to get the “correct” solution based on things that never change (one plus one always equals two) and another part that tries to guess based on intuition when the answer isn’t something we have memorized.
And that’s why two humans of relative intelligence and education can perceive the same scene differently when it comes to processing math. Can you guess how many candies are in the jar below?
a jar full of colored candies
There’s not enough information for you to deduce the correct answer but that doesn’t stop your brain from trying to do math.
What does it all mean?
That remains to be seen. The simple fact that scientists were able to observe individual neurons participating in the math process inside human brains is astounding.
But it could take years of further research to understand the ramifications of these findings. First and foremost, we have to ask: is the human brain a quantum computer?
It makes sense, and this research might give us our first actual glimpses at a quantum function inside the human brain. But, as far as we can tell, they were only able to record and process hundreds of neurons at a time. That’s obviously a very tiny drop from a giant bucket of data.
To help with that, the researchers created an artificial intelligence system to interpret the data in a more robust manner. The hope is that continued research will lead to a greater understanding of math processes in the brain.
Per the paper’s conclusion:
    More fine-grained analyses, ideally combined with perturbation approaches, will help to decipher the individual roles of brain areas and neuronal codes in mental arithmetic.
Yet, there could be potential implications on a much grander scale. The researchers don’t mention the ramifications for technology in their biology experiment or directly discuss its results in quantum computing terms.
But, if this research is accurate, Occam’s Razor tells us that the human brain is probably a quantum computer. Either that, or it’s poorly-designed.
Just like our prehistoric ancestors would have carved notches on the handles of their tools to keep track of objects, a binary brain should be able to handle counting objects through localized abstraction mechanisms.
Why go through all the trouble of hallucinating an answer across myriad neuronal complexes when individual neurons could just pretend to be ones and zeros like a binary computer?
The answer may lie in the quantum nature of the universe. When you perform a simple math function, such as adding two plus two, your brain may hallucinate all of the possible answers at once while simultaneously working to both remember the answer (you’ve definitely added those numbers before) and to process the data (1+1+1+1).
If the human brain were binary, you’d probably have to wait for it to go through each permutation individually instead of hallucinating them all at once.
The result is that you’re probably answering the question in your head before you can actively recognize that you’re thinking about it because both functions occur simultaneously. That’s called quantum time travel.

Scientists from Trinity College Dublin believe our brains could use quantum computation. Their discovery comes after they adapted an idea developed to prove the existence of quantum gravity to explore the human brain and its workings.
The brain functions measured were also correlated to short-term memory performance and conscious awareness, suggesting quantum processes are also part of cognitive and conscious brain functions.
If the team's results can be confirmed—likely requiring advanced multidisciplinary approaches—they would enhance our general understanding of how the brain works and potentially how it can be maintained or even healed. They may also help find innovative technologies and build even more advanced quantum computers.
Dr. Christian Kerskens, lead physicist at the Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience (TCIN), is the co-author of the research article that has just been published in the Journal of Physics Communications. He said, ""We adapted an idea, developed for experiments to prove the existence of quantum gravity, whereby you take known quantum systems, which interact with an unknown system. If the known systems entangle, then the unknown must be a quantum system, too. It circumvents the difficulties to find measuring devices for something we know nothing about.
""For our experiments we used proton spins of 'brain water' as the known system. 'Brain water' builds up naturally as fluid in our brains and the proton spins can be measured using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Then, by using a specific MRI design to seek entangled spins, we found MRI signals that resemble heartbeat evoked potentials, a form of EEG signals. EEGs measure electrical brain currents, which some people may recognize from personal experience or simply from watching hospital dramas on TV.""
Electrophysiological potentials like the heartbeat evoked potentials are normally not detectable with MRI and the scientists believe they could only observe them because the nuclear proton spins in the brain were entangled.
Dr. Kerskens added, ""If entanglement is the only possible explanation here then that would mean that brain processes must have interacted with the nuclear spins, mediating the entanglement between the nuclear spins. As a result, we can deduce that those brain functions must be quantum.
""Because these brain functions were also correlated to short-term memory performance and conscious awareness, it is likely that those quantum processes are an important part of our cognitive and conscious brain functions.
""Quantum brain processes could explain why we can still outperform supercomputers when it comes to unforeseen circumstances, decision making, or learning something new. Our experiments, performed only 50 meters away from the lecture theater where Schrödinger presented his famous thoughts about life, may shed light on the mysteries of biology, and on consciousness which scientifically is even harder to grasp.""";3015;['it1z1c2', 'it2jrqt', 'it23i6v', 'it353g9', 'it356n7', 'it3vi2x', 'it3bb6l', 'it1wfew', 'it2129k', 'it4a6zq', 'it2x0e2', 'it2114c', 'it45ed3', 'it4x139', 'it6fpm0', 'it2xoai', 'it20wsp', 'it1ylt6', 'it2zav0', 'it2l22e', 'it4hqk2', 'it4m69q', 'it550eq', 'it5p7d3', 'it61ktr', 'it6qy5a', 'it7gmxi', 'it36otv', 'it1zsly', 'it1z6nf', 'it1z70w', 'it2k9ah', 'it2wlai', 'it30oqe', 'it25lpf', 'it2ywgc', 'it3p9uw', 'it42t25', 'it2sk1n', 'it3g8ip', 'it24tbo', 'it32mko', 'it35ber', 'it35i30', 'it35me1', 'it385br', 'it38gdc', 'it39pxo', 'it3adlq', 'it3bey4', 'it3c4lb', 'it3dp0x', 'it3ioh6', 'it3k4lz', 'it3q1mx', 'it3rzlm', 'it3t885', 'it3uy8j', 'it3wpop', 'it3xjg8', 'it3y6jl', 'it3ze45', 'it41x5w', 'it432nt', 'it44uvd', 'it4cyoz', 'it4r54a', 'it4u1fv', 'it4zq82', 'it50kz9', 'it3i41e', 'it6aqi6', 'it58qfm', 'it5z4j6', 'it5zstw', 'it6220d', 'it661d1', 'it66544', 'it6cb80', 'it6gz9p', 'it6l58b', 'itiw1ir', 'it0kw1g', 'it0fm1r', 'it0zp1a', 'it1fagk', 'it1r2pk', 'it3k07h', 'iszyxzm', 'it3q32b', 'it410e0', 'it3426r', 'it3wfk2', 'it7vo2k', 'it838kx', 'it6ysgb', 'itadk41', 'it769lq', 'itle3u5', 'it8gif1'];100;1

A special form of light made using an ancient Namibian gemstone could be the key to new light-based quantum computers, which could solve long-held scientific mysteries, according to new research led by the University of St Andrews.
The research, conducted in collaboration with scientists at Harvard University in the US, Macquarie University in Australia and Aarhus University in Denmark and published in Nature Materials, used a naturally mined cuprous oxide (Cu2O) gemstone from Namibia to produce Rydberg polaritons, the largest hybrid particles of light and matter ever created.
Rydberg polaritons switch continually from light to matter and back again. In Rydberg polaritons, light and matter are like two sides of a coin, and the matter side is what makes polaritons interact with each other.
This interaction is crucial because this is what allows the creation of quantum simulators, a special type of quantum computer, where information is stored in quantum bits. These quantum bits, unlike the binary bits in classical computers that can only be 0 or 1, can take any value between 0 and 1. They can therefore store much more information and perform several processes simultaneously.
This capability could allow quantum simulators to solve important mysteries of physics, chemistry and biology, for example, how to make high-temperature superconductors for highspeed trains, how cheaper fertilizers could be made potentially solving global hunger, or how proteins fold making it easier to produce more effective drugs.
Project lead Dr. Hamid Ohadi, of the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, says that ""making a quantum simulator with light is the holy grail of science. We have taken a huge leap towards this by creating Rydberg polaritons, the key ingredient of it.""
To create Rydberg polaritons, the researchers trapped light between two highly reflective mirrors. A cuprous oxide crystal from a stone mined in Namibia was then thinned and polished to a 30-micrometer thick slab (thinner than a strand of human hair) and sandwiched between the two mirrors to make Rydberg polaritons 100 times larger than ever demonstrated before.
One of the leading authors Dr. Sai Kiran Rajendran, of the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, says that ""purchasing the stone on eBay was easy. The challenge was to make Rydberg polaritons that exist in an extremely narrow color range.""
The team is currently further refining these methods in order to explore the possibility of making quantum circuits, which are the next ingredient for quantum simulators.";2675;['i5b3dqm', 'i5b0g9b', 'i5axu6h', 'i5axsu5', 'i5b61jj', 'i5aze4b', 'i5b2alo', 'i5b529j', 'i5ax7xn', 'i5cl2oq', 'i5b361d', 'i5cfubw', 'i5ay2jq', 'i5b22rl', 'i5b24fb', 'i5b9wxs', 'i5bfb5u', 'i5cve3r', 'i5b06ip', 'i5d4vdj', 'i5azmjh', 'i5b4zat', 'i5b07ed', 'i5b0aew', 'i5b0frh', 'i5b0p2l', 'i5b0z72', 'i5b1bqo', 'i5b2irw', 'i5b2s2h', 'i5b3n82', 'i5b47xf', 'i5b5qqo', 'i5b9ebw', 'i5baowz', 'i5bbag7', 'i5bgocj', 'i5biqb5', 'i5bk10q', 'i5bn6rt', 'i5bozp5', 'i5bpe34', 'i5brl8n', 'i5bvc04', 'i5bvqz0', 'i5bx0yd', 'i5bx6n5', 'i5bxt9j', 'i5by4pq', 'i5c15hv', 'i5c2get', 'i5c2hhs', 'i5c5h09', 'i5c5r9q', 'i5c631r', 'i5c6jvw', 'i5c82vm', 'i5c98sd', 'i5cae26', 'i5cbjf5', 'i5cd2mu', 'i5cfrnh', 'i5cgnv3', 'i5cgxhn', 'i5ci44g', 'i5cjqln', 'i5clwxf', 'i5cmveh', 'i5co4kg', 'i5cpae9', 'i5crbnl', 'i5csp1j', 'i5cukad', 'i5cuxxq', 'i5cy7r4', 'i5cz6gw', 'i5d2qsv', 'i5d4pdx', 'i5d4sci', 'i5d4una', 'i5d5b59', 'i5d71r1', 'i5d8ryb', 'i5d9h1t', 'i5d9hdu', 'i5dc1m0', 'i5dgr8t', 'i5di7v2', 'i5eav5g', 'i5evb95', 'i5f62im', 'i5f87b3', 'i5fhkp1', 'i5fw8u6', 'i5hcvas', 'i5ix3o0', 'i5azz30', 'i5b0dus'];98;1

It harnesses the bizarro-world properties of quantum physics to ensure that information sent from point A to point B isn’t intercepted. The laws of physics dictate that nobody—not even the NSA—can measure a quantum system without disrupting it.
The problem, as Edward Snowden could probably tell you, is that quantum cryptography is still in its infancy. It only works over relatively short distances, and the required gear—including lasers and a dedicated fiber optic network—is prohibitively expensive, limiting its use to a handful of research labs, corporations and governments.
A new research paper from scientists at Toshiba brings quantum cryptography a baby-step closer to the masses. The paper, published today in Nature, explains how to expand a point-to-point quantum network with only two users into a “quantum access network” with up to 64 users.
“This kind of communication cannot be defeated by future advances in computing power, nor new mathematical algorithms, nor fancy new engineering,” said co-author Andrew Shields, head of the Quantum Information Group of Toshiba Research Europe. “As long as the laws of physics hold true, it will ensure that your communications are fully secured.”
A quantum network uses specially polarized photons to encode an encryption key—a very long series of numbers and letters that can unlock a digital file. The photons are then sent down a fiber optic cable until they reach their destination, a photon detector, which counts them, and delivers the key to the intended recipient. If the photons are interfered with, the individual packets of information are forever altered and the recipient can see the telltale signs of tampering.
The Toshiba team focused its efforts on improving the photon detector, and created a system that counts up to 1 billion photons per second, which makes it feasible to add more people to the network. “Our breakthrough is we’ve developed an architecture that is point-to-multipoint. This greatly increase the number of potential users in the network, and reduces costs,” Shields said.
Current quantum cryptography systems from companies like ID Quantique start at around $50,000, and only connect two parties at a time. “If up to 64 people can share a single photon detector than you can spread out those costs,” Shields said.
The next step toward mainstreaming quantum crypto is increasing the distance that photons can travel before they degrade—currently the record is 200 km (124 miles) using a dedicated fiber optic cable. But researchers are working on ways to transmit quantum bits on so-called “noisy” fiber that carries other information, which means that the day may not be far away when your Gmail may have a quantum key.
Until then, it’s probably safer to assume that Big Brother is listening.";2969;['cc2v7im', 'cc2w8op', 'cc2v9tn', 'cc2wp7e', 'cc2wbud', 'cc2wgtj', 'cc2wzeq', 'cc33vk0', 'cc2xrbs', 'cc2weho', 'cc2wd8y', 'cc3141v', 'cc2xrls', 'cc2xsng', 'cc2w7bd', 'cc339q5', 'cc2w67r', 'cc2wc8b', 'cc2x9hv', 'cc2xt4l', 'cc2xvdb', 'cc2z69t', 'cc31g51', 'cc39uxj', 'cc3gikx', 'cc2x6gs', 'cc2vwnt', 'cc2wgyf', 'cc2we66', 'cc2wgwt', 'cc2wkit', 'cc2wr6u', 'cc2ws55', 'cc2wtn2', 'cc2wzcp', 'cc2x8j8', 'cc2y4er', 'cc2y51t', 'cc2ye3w', 'cc2yhmh', 'cc2ykll', 'cc2yoxm', 'cc2yoz2', 'cc2yp4g', 'cc2yxbj', 'cc2yxm6', 'cc2z2p3', 'cc2z441', 'cc2zkg9', 'cc2ztcy', 'cc301yg', 'cc31zf3', 'cc339ly', 'cc33cz4', 'cc33qng', 'cc34l40', 'cc355rt', 'cc35igo', 'cc35ox9', 'cc36f55', 'cc36ih7', 'cc3859g', 'cc38kwu', 'cc38lkh', 'cc39qsk', 'cc39uyg', 'cc3a2q6', 'cc2wpq0', 'cc2x4t5', 'cc2yj19', 'cc2z9g5', 'cc33jq5', 'cc33no7', 'cc2wuya', 'cc2wpzn', 'cc2wele', 'cc2wpn1', 'cc2wwvb', 'cc2wzpi', 'cc2x6ip', 'cc2xffo', 'cc2ygr4', 'cc2yhtz', 'cc2ynje', 'cc2ypwm', 'cc2ywqn', 'cc2z3hi', 'cc2z69f', 'cc2zi1f', 'cc32f1p', 'cc33cip', 'cc348fp', 'cc36113', 'cc2x6wo', 'cc3086u', 'cc35rmc', 'cc35ut8', 'cc36ne3'];98;1

I've already posted Q&As with two fellow speakers I shared housing with: biologist Rupert Sheldrake, who urges scientists to take telepathy more seriously; and physicist George Ellis, who deplores the philosophical philistinism of some fellow physicists. Below is my Q&A with another housemate, physicist Carlo Rovelli of Aix-Marseille University and the Intitut Universitaire de France. I interviewed Rovelli by phone in the early 1990s when I was writing a story for Scientific American about loop quantum gravity, a quantum-mechanical version of gravity proposed by Rovelli, Lee Smolin and Abhay Ashtekar. (General relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, is notoriously difficult to reconcile with quantum mechanics.) I was thrilled to meet Rovelli face to face, especially since he turned out to be, like Sheldrake and Ellis, a good as well as smart guy. Rovelli is the author of a leading textbook on quantum gravity and a biography about the ancient Greek philosopher Anaximander (discussed below). For more on Rovelli's views on physics and philosophy, see this 2012 conversation with him on Edge.org.
Horgan: Why did you become a physicist?
Rovelli: I was young in the sixties and seventies, and shared the dream of my generation: changing the world and make it more just and gentle. We lost. I did not know what to do next. I found physics, where, instead, revolutions succeed. I got in love with it. It has been a passion that hasn't ended.
Horgan: Has physics lived up to your expectations?
Rovelli: It has been much better than I expected. Infinite fun and enthusiasm. Investigating the secrets of the world. Thinking things that nobody else has thought before. Great adventures in thinking. Great companions of travel. Fantastic.
Horgan: What is loop quantum gravity?
Rovelli: It is, in my humble opinion, the best tentative theory of quantum gravity we have at present. We do not know if it is right. But we know there is a problem, and this is the best possible solution found so far for this problem.
Horgan: Is it still a viable contender as a unified theory?
Rovelli: ""Unified theory"" generally means a theory that unifies all forces and all fields: a ""theory of everything."" Loop quantum gravity doesn't have anything to do with this. [Horgan note: LQG doesn't include electromagnetism or the nuclear forces.] I think that for the moment we know nothing about a ""unified theory"" and the attempts to write it are by far premature and ill conceived. So, LQG is not a contender as a unified theory. Much more humbly, it is just a tentative solution for a simpler problem: describing the quantum aspects of gravity. Which is to say the quantum aspects of spacetime. This is hard enough. But it is a problem that we have chances to solve, because we have the ingredients.
Horgan: Do multiverse theories and quantum gravity theories deserve to be taken seriously if they cannot be falsified?
Rovelli: No.
Horgan: Do you ever think it's time for physicists to abandon the quest for a unified theory?
Rovelli: The ""quest for a unified theory"" is a misconception. Physicists never really searched for it. They stumbled upon string theory, which to some appeared as a possible unification of everything, and, for lack of imagination, put too much energy into strings. When the enthusiasm for strings begun to fade, many felt lost. Now that supersymmetry is not showing up where string theorists expected it, it is a disarray.
Horgan: Can physics—or science in general—ever completely solve the mystery of the universe?
Rovelli: What is the ""mystery of the universe""? There isn't a ""mystery of the universe."" There is an ocean of things we do not know. Many of them we'll figure out, if we continue to be somewhat rational and do not kill one another first (which is well possible.) There will always be plenty of things that we will not understand, I think, but what do I know? In any case, we are very very very far from any complete comprehension of everything we would like to know.
Horgan: Can science attain absolute truth?
Rovelli: I have no idea what ""absolute truth"" means. I think that science is the attitude of those who find funny the people saying they know something is absolute truth. Science is the awareness that our knowledge is constantly uncertain. What I know is that there are plenty of things that science does not understand yet. And science is the best tool found so far for reaching reasonably reliable knowledge.
Horgan: What's your opinion of the recent philosophy-bashing by Stephen Hawking, Lawrence Krauss and Neil deGrasse Tyson?
Rovelli: Seriously: I think they are stupid in this. I have admiration for them in other things, but here they have gone really wrong. Look: Einstein, Heisenberg, Newton, Bohr.... and many many others of the greatest scientists of all times, much greater than the names you mention, of course, read philosophy, learned from philosophy, and could have never done the great science they did without the input they got from philosophy, as they claimed repeatedly. You see: the scientists that talk philosophy down are simply superficial: they have a philosophy (usually some ill-digested mixture of Popper and Kuhn) and think that this is the ""true"" philosophy, and do not realize that this has limitations.
Here is an example: theoretical physics has not done great in the last decades. Why? Well, one of the reasons, I think, is that it got trapped in a wrong philosophy: the idea that you can make progress by guessing new theory and disregarding the qualitative content of previous theories. This is the physics of the ""why not?"" Why not studying this theory, or the other? Why not another dimension, another field, another universe? Science has never advanced in this manner in the past. Science does not advance by guessing. It advances by new data or by a deep investigation of the content and the apparent contradictions of previous empirically successful theories. Quite remarkably, the best piece of physics done by the three people you mention is Hawking's black-hole radiation, which is exactly this. But most of current theoretical physics is not of this sort. Why? Largely because of the philosophical superficiality of the current bunch of scientists.
Horgan: You have written about the Greek thinker Anaximander. Who was he, and why do you find him interesting?
Rovelli: He is the guy who understood that the Earth is a stone that floats in the middle of the Sky without falling down. He understood that the Sky is not just above out head: it is also under our feet. It surrounds us in every direction. He is the only one in the history of our planet who understood this, and convinced everybody else that this is the case. In fact, he has done much more than this, but this is his greatest achievement. I find him immensely interesting because he represents one of the main steps in the development of scientific thinking. He is a giant.
Horgan: Do you agree with philosopher Thomas Nagel that science needs a new paradigm to account for the emergence of life and consciousness in the cosmos?
Rovelli: No. When we do not understand something, people are tempted to think that ""some new paradigm"" is needed, or a ""great mystery"" is there. Then we understand it, and all fog dissolves.
Horgan: Do you believe in God?
Rovelli: No. But perhaps I should qualify the answer, because like this it is bit too rude and simplistic. I do not understand what ""to believe in God"" means. The people that ""believe in God"" seem like Martians to me. I do not understand them. I suppose this means that I ""do not believe in God"". If the question is whether I think that there is a person who has created Heavens and Earth, and responds to our prayers, then definitely my answer is no, with much certainty.
If the question is whether I believe that ""God"" is a powerful something in the people, which causes a lot of disasters but also a lot of good, then of course I believe it. In fact, I am extremely curious about religion. I think that we should study what is religion much more than what is done. There is a sort of taboo in this, a sort of respect towards people who ""believe in God"", which makes it difficult to understand better.
I think that viewing the ""belief in God"" just as a bunch of silly superstitions is wrong. The ""belief in God"" is one form of human religious attitude, and human religious attitude is something very general and universal about our functioning. Something which is important for man, and we have not yet understood.
Horgan: Are science and religion compatible?
Rovelli: Of course yes: you can be great in solving Maxwell's equations and pray to God in the evening. But there is an unavoidable clash between science and certain religions, especially some forms of Christianity and Islam, those that pretend to be repositories of ""absolute Truths."" The problem is not that scientists think they know everything. It is the opposite: scientists know that there are things we simply do not know, and naturally question those who pretend to know. Many religious people are disturbed by this, and have difficulty in coping with it. The religious person says, ""I know that God has created light saying, 'Fiat Lux.'"" The scientist does not believe the story. The religious people feel threatened. And here the clash develops. But not all religions are like that. Many forms of Buddhism, for instance, have no difficulty with the continual critical attitude of science. Monotheistic religions, and in particular Islam and Christianity, are sometimes less intelligent.
I have an idea about the source of the conflict: there is beautiful research by anthropologists in Australia which shows that religious beliefs are often considered a-temporal but in reality change continuously and adapt to new conditions, new knowledge and so on. This was discovered by comparing religious beliefs held by native Australians studied by anthropologists in the thirties and, much later, in the seventies. So, in a natural situation, religious beliefs adapt to the change in man's culture and knowledge. The problem with Islam and Christianity is that many centuries ago somebody had the idea of writing down beliefs. So now some religious people are stuck with the culture and knowledge of centuries ago. They are fish trapped in a pond of old water.
Horgan: Have you ever accepted money from a military organization?
Rovelli: No. In my country military service was compulsory when I was a young man. I refused to join the army and was briefly detained for this.
Horgan: Do you think physicists—and scientists in general--have a moral responsibility to oppose militarism?
Rovelli: I think that we have a moral responsibility to oppose war as human beings, not as physicists or scientists. I think that the problem is that everybody ""opposes the war"" in words, but then many people are ready to make exceptions to serve their interests, defend their power and economical superiority. And these people hide this behind ""feel good"" words like ""help people"" or ""fight terrorism"". I found this morally disgusting. I wish people were less religious and more moral .
Horgan: In 2002 I bet physicist Michio Kaku $1,000 that by 2020 ""no one will have won a Nobel Prize for work on superstring theory, membrane theory, or some other unified theory describing all the forces of nature.” Who do you think is going to win? [Horgan note: Lee Smolin was originally going to bet against me but backed out at the last minute, the big chicken.]
Rovelli: You. No doubt.
Postscript from Horgan: In the comments section, you can see that Carlo Rovelli posts responses to some early comments on his remarks. I'm copying his responses here for easier access.
A few answers from carlo rovelli:
- to “lakefield”: I actually loved these questions: finally general questions allowing ideas to be expressed, instead of the common boring technicalities.
- to “pupplesan”: I think what you do in your post about the “hard problem of consciousness is not characterising it, but rather anticipating a possible answer. Which might be right. Or not.
- to “Strangelove”: Yes, Archimedes and Eudoxus are also giants. Establishing ranking is not of much interest, I think. I had the misfortune that my US publisher chose the title “The First Scientist” for my book on Anaximander, raising a silly priority debate. I meant bringing attention to Anaximander’s wonderful achievements, not to open an empty discussions about who is greatest or the first! More on the substance of your post, I agree that the key is being testable, which is the main thing you say. But I think that the picture of science as “random guesses” then tested is not a good picture. The “guesses” that have a good chance of being later confirmed are those that have ground. Your example about the spherical Earth is very good: there had been a long sequence of observations, arguments and rational thinking (An example in Aristotle’s ‘On the Heavens’ is the round shade of the Earth on the Moon during lunar eclipses) that provided very strong plausibility to the idea. I think that a problem of today’s theoretical physics is the difficulty of appreciating the difference between a “random guess” and a “well motivated guess”.
- to “ZoranOstric”. You ask about a way to overcome this separation. I think a good starting point could be simply physicists stoping talking philosophy down. For centuries scientists were cultured people, who knew the main philosophical ideas of the past, knew well the history of science, and were very curious about the philosophers of their own times. Yes, I do think that knowing what people in analytical philosophy do now would be useful. There are many thinker in analytical philosophy nowadays that I have found very interesting for a physics (Butterfield, Price, Earman, Norton, Dorato, van Fraassen, Bitbol, Halvorson, Brown, Wuthrich, Myrvold, Ismael, Weinstein, Sauders… just to name a few at random). An example: people talking about “other worlds existing” could usefully read John Austin and David Lewis, at least to avoid using “exist” so superficially…
- to ""cshbar"", who asks: 'how [my] favored theory can be falsified?' Good question. Thanks. Answers in several steps:(i) In principle, Loop Quantum Gravity gives specific quantitative predictions, for instance regarding the possible values of the area of any surface, or cross section. Any measurement of a cross section that does not enter the set of the values predicted by theory falsifies the theory. (ii) These predictions are pretty general, and the situation is very different from string theory, which has zillions of vacua each with a different set of predictions, or multiuniverses, where it is not even very clear what a 'prediction' is going to be.(iii) In practice, it is difficult to test predictions, because the Planck length is small.(iv) But the claim of LQG is simple, and low key: it is not a theory we try to sell as the final theory of everything that everybody should buy; we present it is a tentative theory whose physical viability we ourselves we are far from sure about, until some empirical support comes in.(v) As for myself, predictions and testing the theory is what I am consider interesting and what I am working on. This is why I am trying to use the theory to compute the probability of black holes tunnelling into white holes, with the hope to see signals of this process in cosmic rays, and get hard testing. So, the short answer is: LQG is developed with the idea that what cannot be tested empirically is not good science.";15756;['cjxg867', 'cjxg0aj', 'cjxgd37', 'cjxq5gj', 'cjxj1kw', 'cjxjypf', 'cjy6p9g', 'cjy8ru8', 'cjxp7zy', 'cjxv0vw', 'cjxvze0', 'cjxfedi', 'cjxoe44', 'cjy49d3', 'cjxfsl3', 'cjxms8y', 'cjxnof5', 'cjxtpm2', 'cjxzxzw', 'cjy6bgf', 'cjyagw0', 'cjxj94x', 'cjxhw5e', 'cjxsux9', 'cjxlvly', 'cjxot6k', 'cjxgff9', 'cjxq0f3', 'cjy70mx', 'cjy8ee9', 'cjy8zac', 'cjxgo8u', 'cjxg867', 'cjxg0aj', 'cjxgd37', 'cjxq5gj', 'cjxj1kw', 'cjxjypf', 'cjy6p9g', 'cjy8ru8', 'cjxp7zy', 'cjxv0vw', 'cjxvze0', 'cjxfedi', 'cjxoe44', 'cjy49d3', 'cjxfsl3', 'cjxms8y', 'cjxnof5', 'cjxtpm2', 'cjxzxzw', 'cjy6bgf', 'cjyagw0', 'cjxj94x', 'cjxhw5e', 'cjxsux9', 'cjxlvly', 'cjxot6k', 'cjxgff9', 'cjxq0f3', 'cjy70mx', 'cjy8ee9', 'cjy8zac', 'cjxgo8u', 'cjxzh4j', 'cjy4dxq', 'cjy0iwx', 'cjy3cmt', 'cjzu1p5', 'cjy7taj', 'cjy1pgd', 'cjybqot', 'cjy4zj1', 'cjy7mnn', 'cjyc90l', 'cjycty4', 'cjy8i5r', 'cjxzh4j', 'cjy4dxq', 'cjy0iwx', 'cjy3cmt', 'cjzu1p5', 'cjy7taj', 'cjy1pgd', 'cjybqot', 'cjy4zj1', 'cjy7mnn', 'cjyc90l', 'cjycty4', 'cjy8i5r'];90;1

The quantum computer has the potential to revolutionize the 21st century, solving problems so massively complex they would baffle today’s computers. But a single quantum computer is still no match for the more than billion classical computers currently in use. Quantum computers need a quantum internet, and researchers may just have found the perfect — and practical — material to built that network.
A team at the Australian National University details this big challenge facing dreamers who want to create a quantum internet in a paper published Monday in Nature Physics.
How can one store quantum information in a way that can be transmitted across the planet? Being able to keep quantum bits, or qubits, entangled over tens of thousands of miles is a huge challenge, considering it’s only recently that researchers were able to move beyond a few meters.
But it is more an engineering problem than a theoretical one, and their work suggests a crystal treated with the element erbium just might be the answer. These crystals allowed the researchers to store quantum information successfully for 1.3 seconds.
That may not sound like much, but it’s actually a whopping 10,000 times longer than what has been accomplished before. And when you consider information traveling at the speed of light needs far less than a second to travel around the world, 1.3 seconds is already long enough to start thinking about a global quantum internet.
Erbium is a common enough element found in fluorescent lights, older-model televisions, and lasers. It’s already used in existing fiber optic networks because it naturally operates at the right wavelength to greatly boost communication signals.
It turns out the same principle can work for a quantum communications network. Using erbium-treated crystals means there would be no need to build an entirely new network, as the researchers say quantum information transmitted by using such crystals would be compatible with the planet’s existing telecommunications system.
Any other material than erbium would operate at a different wavelength, meaning a quantum internet would need to convert qubits from wavelength to another and then back again as part of any transmission, which makes an already fiendishly complicated challenge a nearly impossible one.

In physics, systems traveling forward in time evolve from a simple state to a more complicated one—known as the thermodynamic arrow of time. For example, if you were to put a drop of ink into a glass of water, initially it would have a well-defined state. However, it soon starts to spread out and within a few minutes it will have uniformly dissolved into the water. If time were reversed for a human, they would become younger.
In a study published in the journal Scientific Reports, scientists from the U.S. and Russia have experimentally demonstrated time reversal—sending a qubit from a more complicated state to a simpler one.
The algorithm they suggest changes the quantum developed state so it starts to develop back in time. ""Doing this magic with the developed state of ink we will see that after the same time (time needed for the dissolving of ink in the water) the ink will again combine back into the original drop,"" study author Andrei Lebedev told Newsweek. ""This is exactly what we did in our work where the drop of ink is state of three qubits, and the water is a Hilbert state of the quantum computer.""
Lead author Gordey Lesovik said in a statement: ""This is one in a series of papers on the possibility of violating the second law of thermodynamics. That law is closely related to the notion of the arrow of time that posits the one-way direction of time: from the past to the future.""
In the experiment, researchers set the state of each qubit to what you would think of as zero. From this point, the order is lost and the qubits became more and more complex, changing to a pattern of zeros and ones. Next, time was reversed by a specially developed program that allows the quantum computer to go from a state of chaos to order—going from complex to simple. As a result, the qubits are sent backwards in time.
The program was successful in a two qubit quantum computer around 85 percent of the time. When a third qubit was introduced, more errors occurred and the success rate fell to around 50 percent. So developing a quantum computer that can reverse time on a large scale is not going to happen any time soon. Furthermore, it indicates time reversal in nature is unlikely because it is too complex.
""Such an unfortunate growth of the complexity explains why do we not observe such time-reversed objects in the Nature,"" Lebedev said. ""The probability of a spontaneous appearance of a time-reversed object (particle of a system of particles) is negligible.""
However, he also said their time reversal algorithm could be used to test quantum computer programs. ""In quantum computation, unlike the classical analog, we cannot interrupt the computation process until the very end.
""The problem is that a quantum computer is in the superposition state and if we interrupt it and measure its state we destroy this superposition and project it into one component with some probability.
""Because of that it is not always obvious to verify what at the end of the computation we get is the correct result… Time reversal can help—we do time-reversal of the final state of the computer and run the same quantum program again. If the computation was correct we will arrive to the initial state of the computer.""
Commenting on the findings, Henning Bostelmann, from the Department of Mathematics at the U.K.'s University of York, said that while the researchers have reversed the time evolution of a quantum system, a far larger quantum computer would be needed to perform the experiment on a system of a reasonable size.
He also said it suggests that time reversal for individual atoms or electrons is unlikely. ""Perhaps to the disappointment of science-fiction fans, I should point out that the article does not discuss time travel, or going back to the past, or reversing the principle of cause and effect,"" Bostelmann, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek.
Lebedev said he and the team now plan to investigate time reversal further, and look for situations in nature where their procedure could be more effective.";4215;['eifl5t2', 'eifipkh', 'eih5y2y', 'eigfdjg', 'eifzf8j', 'eig5mg5', 'eih2f7m', 'eigoeb8', 'eigls6q', 'eifnt0q', 'eifoa39', 'eifza7b', 'eig0by8', 'eig43m6', 'eifu8b7', 'eig46ko', 'eig72kz', 'eigj8gl', 'eiglaxa', 'eignpjh', 'eih6y06', 'eih7cik', 'eih7flf', 'eih7h44', 'eih9pfi', 'eihaupu', 'eihg16o', 'eihk20t', 'eihlazi', 'eihqfif', 'eihs9pl', 'eihsvip', 'eihx0ui', 'eii504u', 'eiinzmx', 'eijaj0a', 'eigmjpg', 'eifl5t2', 'eifipkh', 'eih5y2y', 'eigfdjg', 'eifzf8j', 'eig5mg5', 'eih2f7m', 'eigoeb8', 'eigls6q', 'eifnt0q', 'eifoa39', 'eifza7b', 'eig0by8', 'eig43m6', 'eifu8b7', 'eig46ko', 'eig72kz', 'eigj8gl', 'eiglaxa', 'eignpjh', 'eih6y06', 'eih7cik', 'eih7flf', 'eih7h44', 'eih9pfi', 'eihaupu', 'eihg16o', 'eihk20t', 'eihlazi', 'eihqfif', 'eihs9pl', 'eihsvip', 'eihx0ui', 'eii504u', 'eiinzmx', 'eijaj0a', 'eigmjpg'];74;1

In particular, in a double-slit experiment, individual particles that are shot through a pair of slits create a pattern as if they each went through both slits simultaneously and interfered with themselves. Researchers have now shown for the first time that antimatter behaves in the same unintuitive way.
Antimatter particles correspond to the regular particles that we are used to, such as protons and electrons, but with the opposite electrical charge and magnetic properties. But when antimatter and matter meet, they both disappear in a flash of energy, which makes antimatter rare and difficult to study.
A new experiment uses positrons — the antimatter counterpart of electrons — to create a situation similar to a traditional double-slit experiment. While scientists have been able to see the quantum interference of electrons for decades, this is the first time they have been able to observe it for antimatter. They present their results in an article published today in the journal Scientific Advances.
The researchers used positrons that were emitted by a radioactive material and then accelerated and formed into a beam. Instead of traveling through just two slits, as in the classic experiment, the beam went through two sequential gratings with different spacing between the slits. This setup helped magnify the effects the researchers needed to measure. The positrons that survived the trip hit a detector, where they formed an interference pattern.
The difference in how many positrons were detected in the high and low points of the pattern depended on the particles’ energy. When the researchers analyzed this dependence, they were able to show that the pattern must have come from the positrons behaving like waves. Since, on average, fewer than one positron should have been travelling through the gratings at any time, the researchers also note that the interference pattern must have come from the individual particles interfering with themselves.

No word on pricing just yet, but I wouldn't expect much change from $15 million—the cost of a non-universal D-Wave quantum computer.
In other news, IBM has also opened up an API (sample code available on Github) that gives developers easier access to the five-qubit quantum computer currently connected to the IBM cloud. Later in the year IBM will release a full SDK, further simplifying the process of building quantum software.
You can't actually do much useful computation with five qubits, mind you, but fortunately IBM also has news there: the company's quantum simulator can now simulate up to 20 qubits. The idea is that developers should start thinking about potential 20-qubit quantum scenarios now, so they're ready to be deployed when IBM builds the actual hardware.
Speaking of hardware, it seems IBM has accelerated its universal quantum computing roadmap somewhat. In May last year IBM said it would like to build a 50-qubit computer ""in the next decade."" Now we're down to ""the next few years.""
IBM has also fleshed out its quantum computing roadmap a little, providing some guidance on how it will actually build a universal 50-qubit computer:
IBM’s roadmap to scale to practical quantum computers is based on a holistic approach to advancing all parts of the system. IBM will leverage its deep expertise in superconducting qubits, complex high performance system integration, and scalable nanofabrication processes from the semiconductor industry to help advance the quantum mechanical capabilities.
Despite the aggressive roadmap, however, there is no evidence that any scaling has, in fact, occurred. Recal the original publication, which involved nine computational qubits, and a total of 1000 qubits. Now IBM wants their quantum computer to be fully interconnected, so 50 computational qubits requires 1,225 connections. Each link seems to require 48 qubits for control, so 58,800 qubits. This is quite a jump for 1000 qubits on a board.
Comparing to D-Wave, which also produces boards with around 1000 qubits, they always end up with one or two non-functional qubits. In this case, it is most likely that a non-functional qubit will be in the connection between two computational qubits, rendering not one, but two nodes useless.
We'll be a lot more confident in IBM's scaling when we see actual papers with increasing numbers of computational qubits.
Other than D-Wave, IBM doesn't have much competition in the quantum computing space—and as we've explained in the past, both companies appear to be approaching quantum computing quite differently. IBM has set its sights on building a true universal quantum computer, which can be used to solve any quantum algorithm under the sun. D-Wave seems more focused on scaling up the number of qubits and ensuring its system can integrate easily with classical computers, but not ensuring its qubits are actually qubits.
While exact pricing, availability, and specs are still a long way off, it's fairly safe to assume that IBM's quantum computers will be about the same price as a D-Wave (~$15 million) or perhaps a little dearer. Both systems are fundamentally the same thing: a fancy chip inside a box that contains a multi-stage dilution refrigerator from a company like BlueFors.
Dilution refrigerators take about 24 hours to cool down, but they can then keep the chip at close-to-absolute-zero (~5mK, -273.145°C)—a prerequisite for current quantum computing chips—almost indefinitely.
And finally, a random factoid: the photo on the right shows me standing on a ladder next to one of IBM's dilution refrigerators at IBM Research headquarters in upstate New York back in 2013.";3758;['dekoqy3', 'dekpsjx', 'dekp9c4', 'dekqlgo', 'deko5rh', 'dekom6w', 'dekru3a', 'dekoa0y', 'del1n9l', 'dekpmxn', 'dekt6sa', 'del8vrr', 'delh9jj', 'delpe71', 'delrscx', 'delvx6f', 'dekx05j', 'del6vws', 'deld4x4', 'dem1mix', 'dekv3db', 'dekvz75', 'dekzie8', 'del0agq', 'del0nag', 'del5acx', 'del6xig', 'del8pyy', 'del9ee8', 'delbysd', 'delcx33', 'deldwni', 'delkxp3', 'dellpdf', 'delmmse', 'delqavv', 'dely4hp', 'delynw8', 'delz99u', 'dem4bxq', 'dem5wep', 'den6chr', 'dekqvkf', 'dekvip7', 'del20mq', 'deku34g', 'dekr6ky', 'dekrnuh', 'deks447', 'dekvhp9', 'dekxfqm', 'delsowj', 'del3v63', 'dekpb25', 'deksd7m', 'dekxwn4', 'delepld', 'dekwzak', 'delc0ph', 'dekoptn', 'dekr4u7'];61;1

Post-Quantum Cryptography (opens in new tab) is an emerging field of research, with researchers devising mechanisms to shore up current encryption algorithms against the seemingly unlimited computing performance promised by quantum computers.
The NSA however has expressed its reservations about the potential of quantum computing in a FAQ titled Quantum Computing and Post-Quantum Cryptography. 
“NSA does not know when or even if a quantum computer of sufficient size and power to exploit public key cryptography (a CRQC) will exist,” said the security agency in response to whether it is worried about the potential of adversarial use of quantum computing.
Public-key encryption drives most of the standards and protocols on the internet and the cloud, which help ensure the integrity of the data even when it’s been hijacked by snoopers.
In the FAQ, the NSA describes a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) as a quantum computer that’s capable of actually attacking real world cryptographic systems, something that’s currently infeasible.
While it agrees that such a computer would be “devastating” to the digital security infrastructure, it seems to suggest that it doesn’t believe such a CRQC would ever materialize.
However, the growing research in quantum computing has moved the agency to also support the development of post-quantum cryptographic standards, along with plans for eventual transition to such standards.
However, speaking to industry experts, The Register concludes that research on cryptography standards aren’t much of a concern to cybersecurity (opens in new tab) specialists.
“In a world where users will divulge their passwords (opens in new tab) in return for chocolate or in response to an enticing phishing email (opens in new tab), the risk of quantum computers might not be our biggest threat,” Martin Lee, a technical lead at Cisco's Talos security division told The Register.

Previous devices have demonstrated up to 60 superconducting qubits, or quantum bits, working together to solve problems, but IBM’s new Eagle processor more than doubles that by stringing together 127.
Several approaches are being pursued by teams around the world to create a practical quantum computer, including superconductors and entangled photons, and it remains unclear which will become the equivalent of the transistor which powered the classical computing revolution.
In 2019, Google announced that its Sycamore processor, which uses the same superconducting architecture that IBM is working with, had achieved quantum supremacy – the name given to the point at which quantum computers can solve a problem that a classical computer would find impossible. That processor used 54 qubits, but has since been surpassed by a 56 and then 60-qubit demonstration with the Zuchongzhi superconducting processor from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei.
IBM’s 127-qubit Eagle processor now takes the top spot as the largest, and therefore theoretically most powerful, superconducting quantum computer to be demonstrated. Each additional qubit represents a significant step forward in ability: unlike classical computers, which rise in power in a linear fashion as they grow, one additional qubit effectively doubles a quantum processor’s potential power.
Canadian company D-Wave Systems has sold machines for some years that consist of thousands of qubits, but they are widely considered to be very specific machines tailored towards a certain algorithm called quantum annealing rather than fully programmable quantum computers. In recent years, much progress in quantum computing has focused on superconducting qubits, which is one of the main technologies that Google, USTC and IBM are backing.
Bob Sutor at IBM says that breaking the 100-qubit barrier is more psychological than physical, but that it shows the technology can grow. “With Eagle, we’re demonstrating that we can scale, that we can start to generate enough qubits to get on a path to have enough computation capacity to do the interesting problems. It’s a stepping stone to bigger machines,” he says.
However, it is difficult to compare the power of the IBM chip with previous processors. Both Google and USTC used a common test to assess such chips, which was to simulate a quantum circuit and sample random numbers from its output. IBM claims to have created a more programmable and adaptable processor, but has yet to publish an academic paper setting out its performance or abilities.
Peter Leek at the University of Oxford says it is tempting to assess performance entirely on the qubit count, but that there are other metrics that need to be looked at – none of which has yet been released for Eagle. “It’s definitely positive, it’s good that they’re making something with more qubits, but ultimately it only becomes useful when the processor performs really well,” he says.
Scott Aaronson at the University of Texas at Austin has similar reservations about judging the importance of the new processor at this stage, saying that more detail is needed. “I hope that information will be forthcoming,” he says.
IBM has said that it hopes to demonstrate a 400-qubit processor next year and to break the 1000-qubit barrier the following year with a chip called Condor. At that point, it is expected that a limit on expansion will be reached that requires quantum computers to be created from networks of these processors strung together by fibre-optic links.

Amazon is also in the mix. The company the AWS Center for Quantum Computing last year and has via Amazon Web Services since 2019. It's expanding that work to what it says is an essential aspect of helping quantum tech reach its full potential: quantum networking. As such, the company has the AWS Center for Quantum Networking (CQN).
As with quantum computing, it's early days for quantum networking. It will likely before researchers start getting the most out of quantum tech. However, Amazon has more resources than most to invest in the field.
Amazon notes that quantum networks will be able to connect quantum devices using single photons rather than laser beams (which are utilized in modern optical communications). However, along with enabling certain capabilities of quantum networks, there are some hurdles to overcome when it comes to using a single photon. Quantum mechanics limits the amplification of a single photon, which restricts the range of a network.

A happy accident in the laboratory has led to a breakthrough discovery that not only solved a problem that stood for more than half a century, but has major implications for the development of quantum computers and sensors.In a study published today in Nature, a team of engineers at UNSW Sydney has done what a celebrated scientist first suggested in 1961 was possible, but has eluded everyone since: controlling the nucleus of a single atom using only electric fields.
""This discovery means that we now have a pathway to build quantum computers using single-atom spins without the need for any oscillating magnetic field for their operation,"" says UNSW's Scientia Professor of Quantum Engineering Andrea Morello. ""Moreover, we can use these nuclei as exquisitely precise sensors of electric and magnetic fields, or to answer fundamental questions in quantum science.""
That a nuclear spin can be controlled with electric, instead of magnetic fields, has far-reaching consequences. Generating magnetic fields requires large coils and high currents, while the laws of physics dictate that it is difficult to confine magnetic fields to very small spaces—they tend to have a wide area of influence. Electric fields, on the other hand, can be produced at the tip of a tiny electrode, and they fall off very sharply away from the tip. This will make control of individual atoms placed in nanoelectronic devices much easier.
A new paradigm
Prof Morello says the discovery shakes up the paradigm of nuclear magnetic resonance, a widely used technique in fields as disparate as medicine, chemistry, or mining. ""Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is one of the most widespread techniques in modern physics, chemistry, and even medicine or mining,"" he says. ""Doctors use it to see inside a patient's body in great detail while mining companies use it to analyse rock samples. This all works extremely well, but for certain applications, the need to use magnetic fields to control and detect the nuclei can be a disadvantage.""
Prof Morello uses the analogy of a billiard table to explain the difference between controlling nuclear spins with magnetic and electric fields.
""Performing magnetic resonance is like trying to move a particular ball on a billiard table by lifting and shaking the whole table,"" he says. ""We'll move the intended ball, but we'll also move all the others.""
""The breakthrough of electric resonance is like being handed an actual billiards stick to hit the ball exactly where you want it.""
Amazingly, Prof Morello was completely unaware that his team had cracked a longstanding problem in finding a way to control nuclear spins with electric fields, first suggested in 1961 by a pioneer of magnetic resonance and Nobel Laureate, Nicolaas Bloembergen.
""I have worked on spin resonance for 20 years of my life, but honestly, I had never heard of this idea of nuclear electric resonance,"" Prof Morello says. ""We 'rediscovered' this effect by complete accident—it would never have occurred to me to look for it. The whole field of nuclear electric resonance has been almost dormant for more than half a century, after the first attempts to demonstrate it proved too challenging.""
Out of curiosity
The researchers had originally set out to perform nuclear magnetic resonance on a single atom of antimony—an element that possesses a large nuclear spin. One of the lead authors of the work, Dr. Serwan Asaad, explains: ""Our original goal was to explore the boundary between the quantum world and the classical world, set by the chaotic behaviour of the nuclear spin. This was purely a curiosity-driven project, with no application in mind.""
""However, once we started the experiment, we realised that something was wrong. The nucleus behaved very strangely, refusing to respond at certain frequencies, but showing a strong response at others,"" recalls Dr. Vincent Mourik, also a lead author on the paper.
""This puzzled us for a while, until we had a 'eureka moment' and realised that we were doing electric resonance instead of magnetic resonance.""
Dr. Asaad continued: ""What happened is that we fabricated a device containing an antimony atom and a special antenna, optimized to create a high-frequency magnetic field to control the nucleus of the atom. Our experiment demands this magnetic field to be quite strong, so we applied a lot of power to the antenna, and we blew it up!""
Game on
""Normally, with smaller nuclei like phosphorus, when you blow up the antenna it's 'game over' and you have to throw away the device,"" says Dr. Mourik.""But with the antimony nucleus, the experiment continued to work. It turns out that after the damage, the antenna was creating a strong electric field instead of a magnetic field. So we 'rediscovered' nuclear electric resonance.""
After demonstrating the ability to control the nucleus with electric fields, the researchers used sophisticated computer modelling to understand how exactly the electric field influences the spin of the nucleus. This effort highlighted that nuclear electric resonance is a truly local, microscopic phenomenon: the electric field distorts the atomic bonds around the nucleus, causing it to reorient itself.
""This landmark result will open up a treasure trove of discoveries and applications,"" says Prof Morello. ""The system we created has enough complexity to study how the classical world we experience every day emerges from the quantum realm. Moreover, we can use its quantum complexity to build sensors of electromagnetic fields with vastly improved sensitivity. And all this, in a simple electronic device made in silicon, controlled with small voltages applied to a metal electrode!""";5721;['fmg0kqa', 'fmfzrrc', 'fmfz12z', 'fmg10c9', 'fmgjai0', 'fmgn1wu', 'fmhhgku', 'fmi1u23', 'fmhljyb', 'fmgd0er', 'fmgl3gr', 'fmgmvox', 'fmgwg0q', 'fmgwxfl', 'fmh93xt', 'fmi0but', 'fmi6ba2', 'fmg9ez5', 'fmg401n', 'fmg6rat', 'fmg78il', 'fmg84b3', 'fmglxui', 'fmgty4i', 'fmh10o4', 'fmhbxn0', 'fmhl0uj', 'fmhqhjb', 'fmj3zsl', 'fmjfa0r', 'fmjsoai', 'fmo8bcm', 'fmgp7v2', 'fme9qb1', 'fmej4u7', 'fmeq9px', 'fmers0s', 'fmepkoc', 'fmfqnej', 'fmfyz04', 'fmeeqcc', 'fmesyhu', 'fmewdj2', 'fmeqstx', 'fmerf3z', 'fmf0nc6', 'fmf4lh9', 'fmfzpfr', 'fmepaax', 'fmg4eiv', 'fmgf0vf'];51;1

Whether it’s photovoltaics or fusion, sooner or later, human civilization must turn to renewable energies. This is deemed inevitable considering the ever-growing energy demands of humanity and the finite nature of fossil fuels. As such, much research has been pursued in order to develop alternative sources of energy, most of which utilize electricity as the main energy carrier. The extensive R&D in renewables has been accompanied by gradual societal changes as the world adopted new products and devices running on renewables. The most striking change as of recently is the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. While they were hardly seen on the roads even 10 years ago, now millions of electric cars are being sold annually. The electric car market is one of the most rapidly growing sectors, and it helped propel Elon Musk to become the wealthiest man in the world.
Unlike traditional cars which derive energy from the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, electric vehicles rely on batteries as the storage medium for their energy. For a long time, batteries had far lower energy density than those offered by hydrocarbons, which resulted in very low ranges of early electric vehicles. However, gradual improvement in battery technologies eventually allowed the drive ranges of electric cars to be within acceptable levels in comparison to gasoline-burning cars. It is no understatement that the improvement in battery storage technology was one of the main technical bottlenecks which had to be solved in order to kickstart the current electric vehicle revolution.
However, despite the vast improvements in battery technology, today consumers of electric vehicles face another difficulty – slow battery charging speed. Currently, cars take about 10 hours to fully recharge at home. Even the fastest superchargers at the charging stations require up to 20-40 minutes to fully recharge the vehicles. This creates additional costs and inconvenience to the customers.
To address this problem, scientists looked for answers in the mysterious field of quantum physics. Their search has led to the discovery that quantum technologies may promise new mechanisms to charge batteries at a faster rate. Such concept of “quantum battery” has been first proposed in a seminal paper published by Alicki and Fannes in 2012. It was theorized that quantum resources, such as entanglement, can be used to vastly speed up the battery charging process by charging all cells within the battery simultaneously in a collective manner.
This is particularly exciting as modern large-capacity batteries can contain numerous cells. Such collective charging is not possible in classical batteries, where the cells are charged in parallel independently of one another. The advantage of this collective versus parallel charging can be measured by the ratio called the ‘quantum charging advantage’. Later, around the year 2017, it was noticed that there can be two possible sources behind this quantum advantage – namely ‘global operation’ (in which all the cells talk to all others simultaneously, i.e., “all sitting at one table”) and ‘all-to-all coupling’ (every cell can talk with every other, but a single cell, i.e., “many discussions, but every discussion has only two participants”). However, it is unclear whether both these sources are necessary and whether there are any limits to the charging speed that can be achieved.
Recently, scientists from the Center for Theoretical Physics of Complex Systems within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) further explored these questions. The paper, which was chosen as an “Editor’s Suggestion” in the journal Physical Review Letters, showed that all-to-all coupling is irrelevant in quantum batteries and that the presence of global operations is the only ingredient in the quantum advantage. The group went further to pinpoint the exact source of this advantage while ruling out any other possibilities and even provided an explicit way of designing such batteries.
In addition, the group was able to precisely quantify how much charging speed can be achieved in this scheme. While the maximum charging speed increases linearly with the number of cells in classical batteries, the study showed that quantum batteries employing global operation can achieve quadratic scaling in charging speed. To illustrate this, we will consider a typical electric vehicle with a battery that contains about 200 cells. Employing this quantum charging would lead to a 200 times speedup over classical batteries, which means that at home charging time would be cut from 10 hours to about 3 minutes. At high-speed charging stations, the charge time would be cut from 30 minutes to mere seconds.
Researchers say that consequences can be far-reaching and that the implications of quantum charging can go well beyond electric cars and consumer electronics. For example, it may find key uses in future fusion power plants, which require large amounts of energy to be charged and discharged in an instant. Of course, quantum technologies are still in their infancy and there is a long way to go before these methods can be implemented in practice. Research findings such as these, however, create a promising direction and can incentivize the funding agencies and businesses to further invest in these technologies. If employed, it is believed that quantum batteries would completely revolutionize the way we use energy and take us a step closer to our sustainable future.";5573;['i1qryn3', 'i1r0kv2', 'i1r2ehx', 'i1rpkdm', 'i1qvdmo', 'i1s8992', 'i1s703e', 'i1tght7', 'i1scwyw', 'i1sz4rm', 'i1tadix', 'i1tj1wu', 'i1tm334', 'i1tn8xe', 'i1rgj9o', 'i1rihxt', 'i1ruep4', 'i1ruf5l', 'i1rv7id', 'i1s1c40', 'i1s5oq0', 'i1s5yya', 'i1sgx2p', 'i1sjfes', 'i1slg6h', 'i1slja7', 'i1snvnv', 'i1stqyn', 'i1sx7vl', 'i1t1h58', 'i1t2574', 'i1t2hlm', 'i1t3ui9', 'i1t4ksj', 'i1t54li', 'i1t5e99', 'i1t5tt0', 'i1t65xn', 'i1t67t4', 'i1t6n7g', 'i1t7qzb', 'i1tcoz3', 'i1tk2eo', 'i1tmut3', 'i1too43', 'i1tsblg', 'i1u9qcg', 'i1xytn5', 'i2ha1oq', 'i1rr7yt', 'i1rx26g'];51;1

According to the application, AMD is researching a system that aims to use quantum teleportation to increase a quantum system's reliability, while simultaneously reducing the number of qubits necessary for a given calculation. The aim is to both alleviate scaling problems and calculation errors stemming from system instability.
There are two major hurdles on the road to quantum development and eventual quantum supremacy: scalability and stability. Quantum states are a fickle matter, so sensitive that they can decohere at the slightest provocation -- and a quantum system's sensitivity tends to increase with the presence of more qubits in a given system.
The AMD patent, titled ""Look Ahead Teleportation for Reliable Computation in Multi-SIMD Quantum Processor,"" aims to improve quantum stability, scalability, and performance in novel, more efficient ways. It describes a quantum architecture based on quantum processing regions: areas of the chip that hold or can hold qubits, lying in wait for their turn on the processing pipeline. AMD's approach aims to improve on existing quantum architectures by actually reducing the number of qubits needed to perform complex calculations -- via the science fiction-esque concept of quantum teleportation.
AMD's design aims to teleport qubits across regions, enabling workloads that would theoretically require in-order execution to become capable of being processed in an out-of-order philosophy. As a quick refresher, in-order execution features dependencies between one instruction and the next, meaning that a workload has to be processed sequentially, with later steps dependent on the previous step being fully processed and its result being known before the chip can move ahead with the computation.
As you may imagine, there are chip resources (in this case, qubits) that sit idle until it's their time to perform the next calculation step. On the other hand, Out-of-order execution analyzes a given workload, figures out which parts of it are dependent on previous results and which are not, and executes every step of the instruction that doesn't require a previous result, thus improving performance via increased parallelism.
AMD's patent also includes a look-ahead processor embedded into the architecture,
tasked to analyze the input workload, predict what steps can be tackled in parallel (and those that can't), and appropriately distribute the workload across qubits, using a quantum teleporting technique to deliver them to the required quantum processing, SIMD-based region.
How this quantum teleportation occurs isn't described in the patent -- it looks like AMD is playing its cards close to its chest on this one. Perhaps we're looking at the beginning of AMD's ""Zen 98"" design (that's a joke, to be clear), or maybe this will not materialize in an actual product. But it does show, beyond any doubt and surprising no one, that AMD is indeed working on quantum computing. That seems to be the next great computing race. And while AMD may or may not be backing the right horse to ride toward an eventual victory, at least it seems the company does plan to be a part of the race.";3372;['hbbbw4n', 'hbbmmhm', 'hbc1x16', 'hbbxziw', 'hbc7al7', 'hbcpngs', 'hbdx7mh', 'hbb7ba5', 'hbbwa8n', 'hbc5fvj', 'hbdorx1', 'hbedm9p', 'hbg8h3y', 'hbbcfjc', 'hbbd9o9', 'hbc1h5p', 'hbcag5s', 'hbcbhpi', 'hbcfgtk', 'hbcrvos', 'hbdiu9a', 'hbdqscg', 'hbdwd4c', 'hbe1f5f', 'hbed358', 'hbeua44', 'hbezb64', 'hbfbmxx', 'hbfgepp', 'hbfpxi1', 'hbfr83l', 'hbfx9fu', 'hbgtn3r', 'hbblyct', 'hbbfdfb', 'hbblihw', 'hbbttfe', 'hbcmsel', 'hb15ebw', 'hb1bi1m', 'hb1i0cp', 'hb26uor', 'hbcc4tp', 'hbd7nck', 'hbby2cn', 'hbbxskf', 'hbckmhj', 'hbcaecx', 'hbcxmjo', 'hbdiry7'];50;1

The Chicago network, which will soon be opened to academia and industry, will become one of the nation’s first publicly-available testbeds for quantum security technology.
The network is now actively running quantum security protocols using technology provided by Toshiba, distributing quantum keys over optic cable at a speed of over 80,000 quantum bits per second between Chicago and the western suburbs. Toshiba’s participation in the project makes the Chicago network a unique collaboration between academia, government and industry.
Researchers will use the Chicago network to test new communication devices, security protocols, and algorithms that will eventually connect distant quantum computers around the nation and the world. The work represents the next step towards a national quantum internet, which will have a profound impact on communications, computing, and national security.

These quantum dots produce clean hydrogen fuel from water and sunlight – a sustainable source of energy. They introduce new eco-friendly and powerful materials to solar photocatalysis.
Quantum dots are true all-rounders. These material structures, which are only a few nanometers in size, display a similar behavior to that of molecules or atoms, and their form, size and number of electrons can be modulated systematically. This means that their electrical and optical characteristics can be customized for a number of target areas, such as new display technologies, biomedical applications as well as photovoltaics and photocatalysis.
Fuel production using sunlight and water
Another current line of application-oriented research aims to generate hydrogen directly from water and solar light. Hydrogen, a clean and efficient energy source, can be converted into forms of fuel that are used widely, including methanol and gasoline. The most promising types of quantum dots previously used in energy research contain cadmium, which has been banned from many commodities due to its toxicity. The team of Greta Patzke, Professor at the Department of Chemistry of the University of Zurich (UZH), and scientists from Southwest Petroleum University in Chengdu and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have now developed a new type of nanomaterials without toxic components for photocatalysis.
Indium-containing core with a thin layer of zinc sulfide
The three-nanometer particles consist of a core of indium phosphide with a very thin surrounding layer of zinc sulfide and sulfide ligands. “Compared to the quantum dots that contain cadmium, the new composites are not only environmentally friendly, but also highly efficient when it comes to producing hydrogen from light and water,” explains Greta Patzke. Sulfide ligands on the quantum dot surface were found to facilitate the crucial steps involved in light-driven chemical reactions, namely the efficient separation of charge carriers and their rapid transfer to the nanoparticle surface.
Great potential for eco-friendly applications
The newly developed cadmium-free nanomaterials have the potential to serve as a more eco-friendly alternative for a variety of commercial fields. “The water-soluble and biocompatible indium-based quantum dots can in the future also be tested in terms of biomass conversion to hydrogen. Or they could be developed into low-toxic biosensors or non-linear optical materials, for example,” adds Greta Patzke. She will continue to focus on the development of catalysts for artificial photosynthesis within the University Research Priority Program “LightChEC”.

What's more, the prototype NIST refrigerator, which measures a few inches in outer dimensions, enables researchers to place any suitable object in the cooling zone and later remove and replace it, similar to an all-purpose kitchen refrigerator. The cooling power is the equivalent of a window-mounted air conditioner cooling a building the size of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
""It's one of the most flabbergasting results I've seen,"" project leader Joel Ullom says. ""We used quantum mechanics in a nanostructure to cool a block of copper. The copper is about a million times heavier than the refrigerating elements. This is a rare example of a nano- or microelectromechanical machine that can manipulate the macroscopic world.""
The technology may offer a compact, convenient means of chilling advanced sensors below standard cryogenic temperatures—300 milliKelvin (mK), typically achieved by use of liquid helium—to enhance their performance in quantum information systems, telescope cameras, and searches for mysterious dark matter and dark energy.
As described in Applied Physics Letters, the NIST refrigerator's cooling elements, consisting of 48 tiny sandwiches of specific materials, chilled a plate of copper, 2.5 centimeters on a side and 3 millimeters thick, from 290 mK to 256 mK. The cooling process took about 18 hours. NIST researchers expect that minor improvements will enable faster and further cooling to about 100 mK.
The cooling elements are sandwiches of a normal metal, a 1-nanometer-thick insulating layer, and a superconducting metal. When a voltage is applied, the hottest electrons ""tunnel"" from the normal metal through the insulator to the superconductor. The temperature in the normal metal drops dramatically and drains electronic and vibrational energy from the object being cooled.
NIST researchers previously demonstrated this basic cooling method but are now able to cool larger objects that can be easily attached and removed. Researchers developed a micromachining process to attach the cooling elements to the copper plate, which is designed to be a stage on which other objects can be attached and cooled. Additional advances include better thermal isolation of the stage, which is suspended by strong, cold-tolerant cords.
Cooling to temperatures below 300 mK currently requires complex, large and costly apparatus. NIST researchers want to build simple, compact alternatives to make it easier to cool NIST's advanced sensors. Researchers plan to boost the cooling power of the prototype refrigerator by adding more and higher-efficiency superconducting junctions and building a more rigid support structure.";2890;['c8svdi1', 'c8t0g9a', 'c8sug51', 'c8t1n92', 'c8t18e6', 'c8szibf', 'c8t1upt', 'c8t7jfx', 'c8swnpl', 'c8syd4p', 'c8t0psn', 'c8t2w1h', 'c8szqtb', 'c8t0hgi', 'c8t0vts', 'c8t12ji', 'c8t176u', 'c8t1nzs', 'c8t1qpe', 'c8t25dt', 'c8t26jc', 'c8t2b8p', 'c8t2vr5', 'c8t4mb9', 'c8t671t', 'c8tan05', 'c8tjpef', 'c8symhh', 'c8szp4f', 'c8t0j2k', 'c8t7lbu', 'c8ta02j', 'c8synj1', 'c8swnvn', 'c8szslp', 'c8sy56g', 'c8t07ww', 'c8sz66y', 'c8syl1c', 'c8sz669', 'c8szuu6', 'c8t018p', 'c8szkyk', 'c8sz59x', 'c8t0fhi'];45;1

Previous experiments have managed to teleport a single property, but scaling that up to two properties proved to be a difficult task, which has only now been achieved. The team’s work is a crucial step forward in improving our understanding of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and the result could also play an important role in the development of quantum communications and quantum computers.
Alice and Bob
Quantum teleportation first appeared in the early 1990s after four researchers, including Charles Bennett of IBM in New York, developed a basic quantum teleportation protocol. To successfully teleport a quantum state, you must make a precise initial measurement of a system, transmit the measurement information to a receiving destination and then reconstruct a perfect copy of the original state. The “no-cloning” theorem of quantum mechanics dictates that it is impossible to make a perfect copy of a quantum particle. But researchers found a way around this via teleportation, which allows a flawless copy of a property of a particle to be made. This occurs thanks to what is ultimately a complete transfer (rather than an actual copy) of the property onto another particle such that the first particle loses all of the properties that are teleported.
The protocol has an observer, Alice, send information about an unknown quantum state (or property) to another observer, Bob, via the exchange of classical information. Both Alice and Bob are first given one half of an additional pair of entangled particles that act as the “quantum channel” via which the teleportation will ultimately take place. Alice would then interact the unknown quantum state with her half of the entangled particle, measure the combined quantum state and send the result through a classical channel to Bob. The act of the measurement itself alters the state of Bob’s half of the entangled pair and this, combined with the result of Alice’s measurement, allows Bob to reconstruct the unknown quantum state. The first experimentation teleportation of the spin (or polarization) of a photon took place in 1997. Since then, the states of atomic spins, coherent light fields, nuclear spins and trapped ions have all been teleported.
But any quantum particle has more than one given state or property – they possess various “degrees of freedom”, many of which are related. Even the simple photon has various properties such as frequency, momentum, spin and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which are inherently linked.
More than one
Teleporting more than one state simultaneously is essential to fully describe a quantum particle and achieving this would be a tentative step towards teleporting something larger than a quantum particle, which could be very useful in the exchange of quantum information. Now, Chaoyang Lu and Jian-Wei Pan, along with colleagues at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, have taken the first step in simultaneously teleporting multiple properties of a single photon.
In the experiment, the team teleports the composite quantum states of a single photon encoded in both its spin and OAM. To transfer the two properties requires not only an extra entangled set of particles (the quantum channel), but a “hyper-entangled” set – where the two particles are simultaneously entangled in both their spin and their OAM. The researchers shine a strong ultraviolet pulsed laser on three nonlinear crystals to generate three entangled pairs of photons – one pair is hyper-entangled and is used as the “quantum channel”, a second entangled pair is used to carry out an intermediate “non-destructive” measurement, while the third pair is used to prepare the two-property state of a single photon that will eventually be teleported.
The image above represents Pan’s double-teleportation protocol – A is the single photon whose spin and OAM will eventually be teleported to C (one half of the hyper-entangled quantum channel). This occurs via the other particle in the channel – B. As B and C are hyper-entangled, we know that their spin and OAM are strongly correlated, but we do not actually know what their values are – i.e. whether they are horizontally, vertically or orthogonally polarized. So to actually transfer A’s polarization and OAM onto C, the researchers make a “comparative measurements” (referred to as CM-P and CM-OAM in the image) with B. In other words, instead of revealing B’s properties, they detect how A’s polarization and OAM differ from B. If the difference is zero, we can tell that A and B have the same polarization or OAM, and since B and C are correlated, that C now has the same properties that A had before the comparison measurement.
On the other hand, if the comparative measurement showed that A’s polarization as compared with B differed by 90° (i.e. A and B are orthogonally polarized), then we would rotate C’s field by 90° with respect to that of A to make a perfect transfer once more. Simply put, making two comparative measurements, followed by a well-defined rotation of the still-unknown polarization or OAM, would allow us to teleport A’s properties to C.
Perfect protocol
One of the most challenging steps for the researchers was to link together the two comparative measurements. Referring to the “joint measurements” box in the image above, we begin with the comparative measurement of A and B’s polarization (CM-P). From here, either one of three scenarios can take place – one photon travels along path 1 to the middle box (labelled “non-destructive photon-number measurement”); no photons enter the middle box along path 1; or two single photons enter the middle box along path 1.
The middle box itself contains the second set of entangled photons mentioned previously (not shown in figure) and one of these two entangled photons is jointly measured with the incoming photons from path 1. But the researcher’s condition is that if either no photons or two photons enter the middle box via path 1, then the measurement would fail. Indeed, what the middle box ultimately shows is that exactly one photon existed in path 1, and so exactly one photon existed in path 2, given that two photons (A and B) entered CM-P. To show that indeed one photon existed in path two required the third and final set of entangled photons in the CP-OAM box (not shown), where the OAM’s of A and B undergo a comparative measurement.
The measurements ultimately result in the transfer or teleportation of A’s properties onto C – although it may require rotating C’s (as yet unknown) polarization and OAM depending on the outcomes of the comparative measurements, but the researchers did not actually implement the rotations in their current experiment. The team’s work has been published in the journal Nature this week. Pan tells physicsworld.com that the team verified that “the teleportation works for both spin-orbit product state and hybrid entangled state, achieving an overall fidelity that well exceeds the classical limit”. He says that these “methods can, in principle, be generalized to more [properties], for instance, involving the photon’s momentum, time and frequency”.
Verification verdicts
Physicist Wolfgang Tittel from the University of Calgary, who was not involved in the current work (but wrote an accompanying “News and Views” article in Nature) explains that the team verified that the teleportation had indeed occurred by measuring the properties of C after the teleportation. “Of course, the no-cloning theorem does not allow them to do this perfectly. But it is possible to repeat the teleportation of the properties of photon A, prepared every time in the same way, many times. Making measurements on photon C (one per repetition) allows reconstructing its properties.” He points out that although the rotations were not ultimately implemented by the researchers, they found that “the properties of C differed from those of A almost exactly by the amount predicted by the outcomes of the comparative measurements. They repeated this large number of measurements for different preparations of A, always finding the properties of C close to those expected. This suffices to claim quantum teleportation”.
While it is technically possible to extend Pan’s method to teleport more than two properties simultaneously, this is increasingly difficult because the probability of a successful comparative measurement decreases with each added property. “I think with the scheme demonstrated by [the researchers], the limit is three properties. But this does not mean that other approaches, either other schemes based on photons, or approaches using other particles (e.g. trapped ions), can’t do better,” says Tittel.
Pan says that to teleport three properties, their scheme “needs the experimental ability to control 10 photons. So far, our record is eight photon entanglement. We are currently working on two parallel lines to get more photon entanglement.” Indeed, he says that the team’s next goal is to experimentally create “the largest hyper-entangled state so far: a six-photon 18-qubit Schrödinger cat state, entangled in three degrees-of-freedom, polarization, orbital angular momentum, and spatial mode. To do this would provide us with an advanced platform for quantum communication and computation protocols”.";9500;['cp435de', 'cp4550r', 'cp43rrf', 'cp3wu6z', 'cp44x84', 'cp457ec', 'cp4hb2f', 'cp5gbkt', 'cp8b63e', 'cp3yn48', 'cp3uwqs', 'cp42i9j', 'cp42aqq', 'cp435de', 'cp4550r', 'cp43rrf', 'cp3wu6z', 'cp44x84', 'cp457ec', 'cp4hb2f', 'cp5gbkt', 'cp8b63e', 'cp3yn48', 'cp3uwqs', 'cp42i9j', 'cp42aqq', 'cp8y76v', 'cp8ggc6', 'cp8m0gp', 'cp9jzdi', 'cp8t495', 'cp8usss', 'cp8y76v', 'cp8ggc6', 'cp8m0gp', 'cp9jzdi', 'cp8t495', 'cp8usss'];38;1

And, for the moment it is utter nonsense. The Internet connects computers, so the quantum Internet pre-supposes the existence of useful quantum computers. The Internet also involves arbitrary on-the-fly routing through many intermediate stations, while current quantum communications protocols rely on point-to-point connections. I can't think of anything less Internet-like than that.
The nice thing about buzzwords, though, is that some people take them seriously while also recognizing the problems inherent to the idea. That leads to some fantastic research. A group of Japanese and British researchers have come up with a communications protocol that overcomes many of the fundamental problems associated with transferring quantum information over long distances. We still don't have a quantum computer, but when we do, these guys know how to connect them up.
Quantum static on your phone line
The issue boils down to the very nature of the quantum state. Usually, when we consider a quantum bit (qubits) of information, we are talking about a single photon. In any optical fiber, there is a certain probability the photon will be absorbed, which increases exponentially with distance. Generally, this limits point-to-point quantum data transfer to distances under 100km.
To expand that range, you need to entangle qubits at distant locations. The idea is that you send photon pairs over short distances and entangle them with neighboring photon pairs. That entangles the two most distance photons with each other. This can be repeated, transferring entanglement over large distances.
The process of entangling two photons is, however, not always successful. So, in a chain of photon pair sources, you might manage half the links on the first attempt. These should be stored in a memory, while the other half tries again. After several repetitions, the end-points are entangled with each other. Unfortunately, this requires a long-lasting quantum memory that can store a lot of different photons. This way, the right photon can be used once the entire entangled chain is established. Such a memory doesn't exist yet.
Quantum entanglement
Quantum entanglement is one of the most misused concepts around. Entanglement is delicate, rare, and short-lived. At its heart, quantum entanglement is nothing more or less than a correlation between two apparently separate quantum objects. Having discovered that, you might ask ""so what is all the fuss about?"" The answer lies deep in quantum mechanics.Read more…
Spreading your bets on photon survival
This would all be so much easier if the quantum state was stored across multiple photons. This is what a team of Japanese and British researchers have been considering. Drawing on early results from optical quantum computing schemes, they realized the error correcting mechanisms proposed for those systems could be used to extend the distance over which a quantum state could be transported.
Their scheme relies on the fact that no one really wants to send a single qubit, instead we want to send lots. These individual qubits can then be blocked together to make one larger quantum state that is the superposition of the individual quantum states. In addition, we add more qubits whose values are determined by the results of mathematical operations on the data qubits. When we do this, a tiny bit of each qubit's state is held by several of the photons within the block, creating lots of redundancy.
Now, it turns out that on the receiving end, one can retrieve the entire quantum state of the data block provided a couple of conditions are met. At least one logical qubit within the block must make it through without loss. And, for each logical qubit, one physical qubit (a photon) survives.
So, if you have a block of a thousand photons—encoding 10 logical qubits in 10 photons with the remaining 990 photons being redundant—we require that one of those 10 photons makes it through cleanly. We also require the remaining photons that make it through contain information about the state of all the remaining qubits. If that occurs, you can retrieve the other 10 from the built-in redundancy.
The downside is, of course, that it takes many more physical qubits to encode a single logical qubit, so you might think that the data rate will be rather low. Not so fast, say the researchers. Information can be encoded on many different quantum states of the qubit, so one qubit could be stored in a superposition of polarization states, while another could be stored in phase, and another in spatial mode profiles, etc. (The nature of these states are unimportant save that we can play with one and not change the other.)
Quantum superposition
Superposition is nothing more than addition for waves. Let's say we have two sets of waves that overlap in space and time. At any given point, a trough may line up with a peak, their peaks may line up, or anything in between. Superposition tells us how to add up these waves so that the result reconstructs the patterns that we observe in nature.Read more…
Those of you paying attention will be questioning this assumption though. Imagine in our previous example that we store three logical qubit states in a single photon. Well, if that photon is absorbed, we have lost three different qubits. Now, our encoding scheme relies on one logical qubit making it through in its entirety. Naively, we might think that this would reduce the chances of this occurring by a factor of three, which would be disastrous.
Luckily, the researchers are not as naive as me, and they have an answer. The encoding system works by blocking data and encoding it together into a single giant quantum state. The trick is to make sure the different quantum states of the same photon are used to encode qubits from different blocks of data. This way, the loss of a photon still results in losing three qubits, but they are from different blocks, making them the equivalent of losing three independent photons.
But wait, it's a router too
The big advantage, though, is this scheme also allows something that looks like quantum routing. The basic process is that the photonic qubits are generated from matter qubits at one end and stored into matter qubits at a node. The storage process involves the emission of photons that can be used to determine the channel losses and appropriately decode the actual quantum data from the block. But, unlike point-to-point schemes, the decoding process doesn't involve measuring the quantum state, it only involves picking the right bits and performing operations on them. This is important, because a measurement would destroy the quantum state. Since the quantum state is preserved, it can be re-encoded in a new block and sent on to a new node.
One can then imagine blocks are chunked into super-blocks with the first block containing routing information, and the remaining blocks being data. The first block could be entirely classical and contain routing information, or it could be stored in qubits, which are read at a node (destroying the quantum nature of the state), and then re-encoded in new qubits. Either way would work.
Where do I order my quantum router?
All through reading this paper, I had my doubts. But it really is a solid bit of work. It is also, I think, going to be regarded as a key paper should quantum networks become ubiquitous and significant. Implementation, though, is going to be challenging. This is because the number of qubits per photon and the number of photons per qubit scale very fast. For instance, if we limit ourselves to losses of 50 percent—that is, the link destroys 50 percent of the photons sent to the receiver—and only store a single logical qubit per photon, then we require over 7000 photons (physical qubits) to transmit 10 logical qubits.
If we go the more complicated route and store multiple qubits per photon, then things get better: only 75 photons are required to transmit 15 photons. But, that assumes that 15 qubits are encoded on each photon, so, we actually need to send a minimum of 15 blocks of data, adding up to 1125 photons for 225 logical qubits.
Why do I care about these numbers? Well, that means we require 1125 matter qubits that can be set to the right value and retained until they are transferred to a photon. Furthermore, we require that each photon acquires 15 different qubits. To do that successfully 98 percent of the time, it will involve an encoding operation that works 99.8 percent of the time. At the moment, these operations have probabilities that are much lower, effectively limiting experiments to a couple of logical qubits per photon.
Nevertheless, these experimental difficulties are well-known and understood. Over time, the situation will improve and in a few years (less than 10), we will see encoding schemes similar to this that can encode more qubits per photon. The quantum Internet may yet lie ready, awaiting the arrival of a quantum computer.";9025;['c7ghtqt', 'c7gi42s', 'c7gi44o', 'c7gjcqz', 'c7gid8h', 'c7gi4nz', 'c7ghy36', 'c7gi4bj', 'c7gioez', 'c7gjhqz', 'c7gjpzy', 'c7gope8', 'c7gt3ql', 'c7gvdml', 'c7gi4wn', 'c7gi7rf', 'c7gj9m7', 'c7gjrop', 'c7gk7ro', 'c7glcqq', 'c7glgsi', 'c7gm02o', 'c7gmbyz', 'c7gmeuf', 'c7gml1c', 'c7gmmws', 'c7gp4se', 'c7grrej', 'c7gu8f0', 'c7guy1h', 'c7gvpqd', 'c7gye39', 'c7gjx8i', 'c7gi21w', 'c7glabp', 'c7gkbwk', 'c7gv53b'];37;1

Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) -- the existence of which was predicted by Albert Einstein and Indian mathematician Satyendra Nath Bose almost a century ago -- are formed when atoms of certain elements are cooled to near absolute zero (0 Kelvin, minus 273.15 Celsius).
At this point, the atoms become a single entity with quantum properties, wherein each particle also functions as a wave of matter.
BECs straddle the line between the macroscopic world governed by forces such as gravity and the microscopic plane, ruled by quantum mechanics.
Scientists believe BECs contain vital clues to mysterious phenomena such as dark energy -- the unknown energy thought to be behind the Universe's accelerating expansion.
But BECs are extremely fragile. The slightest interaction with the external world is enough to warm them past their condensation threshold.
This makes them nearly impossible for scientists to study on Earth, where gravity interferes with the magnetic fields required to hold them in place for observation.
On Thursday a team of NASA scientists unveiled the first results from BEC experiments aboard the International Space Station, where particles can be manipulated free from Earthly constraints.
""Microgravity allows us to confine atoms with much weaker forces, since we don't have to support them against gravity,"" Robert Thompson of from the California Institute for Technology, Pasadena, told AFP.
The research published in the journal Nature documents several startling differences in the properties of BECs created on Earth and those aboard the ISS.
For one thing, BECs in terrestrial labs typically last a handful of milliseconds before dissipating.
Aboard the ISS the BECs lasted more than a second, offering the team an unprecedented chance to study their properties.
Microgravity also allowed the atoms to be manipulated by weaker magnetic fields, speeding their cooling and allowing clearer imaging.
- 'Remarkable' breakthrough -
Creating the fifth state of matter, especially within the physical confines of a space station, is no mean feat.
First, bosons -- atoms that have an equal number of protons and electrons -- are cooled to absolute zero using lasers to clamp them in place.
The slower the atoms move around, the cooler they become.
As they lose heat, a magnetic field is introducedto keep them from moving and each particle's wave expands. Cramming many bosons into a microscopic ""trap"" that causes their waves to overlap into a single matter wave -- a property known as quantum degeneracy.
The second the magnetic trap is released in order for scientists to study the condensate, however, the atoms begin to repel each other, causing the cloud to fly apart and the BEC to becomes too dilute to detect.
Thompson and the team realised that the microgravity on board the ISS allowed them to create BECs from rubidium -- a soft metal similar to potassium -- on a far shallower trap than on Earth. This accounted for the vastly increased time the condensate could be studied before diffusing.
""Most importantly we can observe the atoms as they float entirely unconfined (and hence unperturbed) by external forces,"" Thompson said.
Previous studies trying to emulate the effect of weightlessness on BECs used aeroplanes in free fall, rockets and even apparatus dropped from various heights.
Research team leader David Aveline told AFP that studying BECs in microgravity opened up a host of research opportunities.
""Applications range from tests of general relativity and searches for dark energy and gravitational waves to spacecraft navigation and prospecting for subsurface minerals on the moon and other planetary bodies,"" he said.";3892;['fukiahn', 'fukilp2', 'fuklq4q', 'fukliht', 'fulbcge', 'fuknzma', 'ful4nft', 'ful0wz6', 'fukjih4', 'fukipvm', 'fume6kj', 'ful7mua', 'fukiahn', 'fukilp2', 'fuklq4q', 'fukliht', 'fulbcge', 'fuknzma', 'ful4nft', 'ful0wz6', 'fukjih4', 'fukipvm', 'fume6kj', 'ful7mua', 'fukiahn', 'fukilp2', 'fuklq4q', 'fukliht', 'fulbcge', 'fuknzma', 'ful4nft', 'ful0wz6', 'fukjih4', 'fukipvm', 'fume6kj', 'ful7mua'];36;1

In a new study due this week in the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Rice University theoretical physicist Qimiao Si and colleagues at the Rice Center for Quantum Materials in Houston and the Vienna University of Technology in Austria make predictions that could help experimental physicists create what the authors have coined a “Weyl-Kondo semimetal,” a quantum material with an assorted collection of properties seen in disparate materials like topological insulators, heavy fermion metals and high-temperature superconductors.
All these materials fall under the heading of “quantum materials,” ceramics, layered composites and other materials whose electromagnetic behavior cannot be explained by classical physics. In the words of noted science writer Philip Ball, quantum materials are those in which “the quantum aspects assert themselves tenaciously, and the only way to fully understand how the material behaves is to keep the quantum in view.”
These quirky behaviors arise only at very cold temperatures, where they cannot be masked by the overwhelming forces of thermal energy. The most celebrated quantum materials are the high-temperature superconductors discovered in the 1980s, so named for their ability to conduct electrical current without resistance at temperatures well above those of traditional superconductors. Another classic example is the heavy fermion materials discovered in the late 1970s. In these, electrons appear to be effectively hundreds of times more massive than normal and, equally unusual, the effective electron mass seems to vary strongly as temperature changes.
A generation of theoretical physicists dedicated their careers to explaining the workings of quantum materials. Si’s work focuses on the collective behavior that emerges in electronic materials undergoing transformation from one quantum state to another. It is near such points of transformation, or “quantum critical points,” that phenomena like high-temperature superconductivity occur.
In 2001, Si and colleagues offered a new theory that explained how electronic fluctuations between two entirely different quantum states give rise to such behaviors at quantum critical points. The theory has allowed Si and colleagues to make a host of predictions about the quantum behavior that will arise in particular types of material as the materials are cooled to the quantum critical point. In 2014, Si was tapped to lead the Rice Center for Quantum Materials (RCQM), a universitywide effort that draws upon the work in more than a dozen Rice groups across the schools of Natural Sciences and Engineering.
“We have been absolutely fascinated by strongly correlated materials,” Si said of his own group. “Collective behavior such as quantum criticality and high-temperature superconductivity have always been the center of our attention.
“Over the past two years, several experimental groups have reported nontrivial topology in solid-state conducting materials, but it’s an open question whether there are conducting states that have nontrivial topology and are, at the same time, strongly interacting. No such materials have been realized, but there’s a lot of interest in looking for them.”
In the PNAS study, Si said he and postdoctoral fellow Hsin-Hua Lai and graduate student Sarah Grefe were working with a set of models to examine questions related to quantum criticality and high-temperature superconductors.
“We really just stumbled upon a model in which, suddenly, we found that the mass had gone from like 1,000 times the mass of an electron to zero,” Lai said. A signature characteristic of “Weyl fermions,” elusive quantum particles first proposed by Hermann Weyl more than 80 years ago, is that they have zero mass.
Experimentalists have only recently provided evidence for the existence of solid-state conducting materials that qualify as hosting Weyl fermions. These materials share some of the characteristics of  topological insulators, a type of quantum material that gained international attention following the awarding of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics, but are quite distinct in other ways. Traditionally, topological materials have only been defined in insulators, and electricity would flow only on the materials’ surface and not through the bulk. The topological conductors, however, carry electricity in the bulk, thanks to the Weyl fermions.
“These topological conductors can be described within the textbook framework of independent electrons,” Grefe said. “The central question, as challenging as it is fascinating, is this: What happens when the electron correlations are strong?”
In examining their work more closely, Si, Lai and Grefe demonstrated that their zero-mass fermions are intimately tied to both strong electron correlations and nontrivial topology.
“We quickly realized that these are Weyl fermions that originate from a quintessential strong-correlation physics called the Kondo effect,” Grefe said. “We therefore dubbed this state a Weyl-Kondo semimetal.”
The Kondo effect captures how a band of electrons, which are so strongly correlated with each other that they act as localized spins, behave in a background of conduction electrons.
Together with study co-author Silke Paschen, an experimental physicist at Vienna University of Technology who was spending six months at RCQM as a visiting professor when the discovery was made, Si, Lai and Grefe sought to identify the unique experimental signatures of the Weyl-Kondo semimetal.
“We found that the Kondo effect makes the Weyl fermions move with a velocity that differs by several orders of magnitude from the noninteracting case,” Lai said. “This allowed us to predict that the electron correlations will enhance a particular quantity in the temperature dependence of the specific heat by a mind-boggling factor of a billion.”
Si said this effect is huge, even by the standard of strongly correlated electron systems, and the work points to a larger principle.
“The Kondo effect in these kinds of materials occurs in the vicinity of magnetic order,” Si said. “Our previous work has shown that high-temperature superconductivity tends to develop in systems on the verge of magnetic order, and this study suggests that some strongly correlated topological states develop there as well.
“This may well represent a design principle that will guide the search for a wide variety of strongly correlated topological states,” he said.";6762;['dri8p33', 'drhsbwc', 'drifjlo', 'driizwe', 'drijaol', 'dribssm', 'drihhpi', 'drigtp5', 'drih9h4', 'drikae5', 'drinfh6', 'drip7mb', 'drip99j', 'dripesa', 'driposf', 'dripqb1', 'dript2v', 'driqf4a', 'drisd8f', 'driu5ap', 'driu9ht', 'driuoi8', 'driwxh9', 'driyv4a', 'drj1jkk', 'drj9qn5', 'drjca57', 'drjcp4l', 'drjd0iv', 'drkj11q', 'drienji', 'driooo0', 'driovls', 'drjk3m5', 'dripqpi'];35;1

The experiment used quantum computer programs to ‘rewind’ scattered quantum bits or qubits back to their starting points.

The experiment shows how the strange nature of the universe allows two observers—say, Wigner and Wigner’s friend—to experience different realities.
Since then, physicists have used the “Wigner’s Friend” thought experiment to explore the nature of measurement and to argue over whether objective facts can exist. That’s important because scientists carry out experiments to establish objective facts. But if they experience different realities, the argument goes, how can they agree on what these facts might be?
That’s provided some entertaining fodder for after-dinner conversation, but Wigner’s thought experiment has never been more than that—just a thought experiment.
Last year, however, physicists noticed that recent advances in quantum technologies have made it possible to reproduce the Wigner’s Friend test in a real experiment. In other words, it ought to be possible to create different realities and compare them in the lab to find out whether they can be reconciled.
And today, Massimiliano Proietti at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and a few colleagues say they have performed this experiment for the first time: they have created different realities and compared them. Their conclusion is that Wigner was correct—these realities can be made irreconcilable so that it is impossible to agree on objective facts about an experiment.
Wigner’s original thought experiment is straightforward in principle. It begins with a single polarized photon that, when measured, can have either a horizontal polarization or a vertical polarization. But before the measurement, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, the photon exists in both polarization states at the same time—a so-called superposition.
Wigner imagined a friend in a different lab measuring the state of this photon and storing the result, while Wigner observed from afar. Wigner has no information about his friend’s measurement and so is forced to assume that the photon and the measurement of it are in a superposition of all possible outcomes of the experiment.
Wigner can even perform an experiment to determine whether this superposition exists or not. This is a kind of interference experiment showing that the photon and the measurement are indeed in a superposition.
From Wigner’s point of view, this is a “fact”—the superposition exists. And this fact suggests that a measurement cannot have taken place.
But this is in stark contrast to the point of view of the friend, who has indeed measured the photon’s polarization and recorded it. The friend can even call Wigner and say the measurement has been done (provided the outcome is not revealed).
So the two realities are at odds with each other. “This calls into question the objective status of the facts established by the two observers,” say Proietti and co.
That’s the theory, but last year Caslav Brukner, at the University of Vienna in Austria, came up with a way to re-create the Wigner’s Friend experiment in the lab by means of techniques involving the entanglement of many particles at the same time.
The breakthrough that Proietti and co have made is to carry this out. “In a state-of-the-art 6-photon experiment, we realize this extended Wigner’s friend scenario,” they say.
They use these six entangled photons to create two alternate realities—one representing Wigner and one representing Wigner’s friend. Wigner’s friend measures the polarization of a photon and stores the result. Wigner then performs an interference measurement to determine if the measurement and the photon are in a superposition.
The experiment produces an unambiguous result. It turns out that both realities can coexist even though they produce irreconcilable outcomes, just as Wigner predicted.
That raises some fascinating questions that are forcing physicists to reconsider the nature of reality.
The idea that observers can ultimately reconcile their measurements of some kind of fundamental reality is based on several assumptions. The first is that universal facts actually exist and that observers can agree on them.
But there are other assumptions too. One is that observers have the freedom to make whatever observations they want. And another is that the choices one observer makes do not influence the choices other observers make—an assumption that physicists call locality.
If there is an objective reality that everyone can agree on, then these assumptions all hold.
But Proietti and co’s result suggests that objective reality does not exist. In other words, the experiment suggests that one or more of the assumptions—the idea that there is a reality we can agree on, the idea that we have freedom of choice, or the idea of locality—must be wrong.
Of course, there is another way out for those hanging on to the conventional view of reality. This is that there is some other loophole that the experimenters have overlooked. Indeed, physicists have tried to close loopholes in similar experiments for years, although they concede that it may never be possible to close them all.
Nevertheless, the work has important implications for the work of scientists. “The scientific method relies on facts, established through repeated measurements and agreed upon universally, independently of who observed them,” say Proietti and co. And yet in the same paper, they undermine this idea, perhaps fatally.
The next step is to go further: to construct experiments creating increasingly bizarre alternate realities that cannot be reconciled. Where this will take us is anybody’s guess. But Wigner, and his friend, would surely not be surprised.";5743;['eimdobm', 'eimmuvo', 'eimf6nu', 'eimslr5', 'eimunu3', 'ein9vqh', 'eipq87h', 'eimn3cx', 'eiout9a', 'eipgig4', 'eiptn9z', 'ej0tp0n', 'eid1fhc', 'eid34a6', 'eid4fma', 'eicviqr', 'eid1qba', 'eidd7lx', 'eid7aj9', 'eiena3h', 'eif6w43', 'eien7ur', 'eif0j3k', 'eieuinw', 'eiegtj7', 'eiilmq0', 'eiqt8z6', 'ej43fhk', 'eiexp78', 'eid48ul', 'eidi5m1', 'eidgvis'];32;1

A new experiment out of Paris has demonstrated, for the first time, that quantum communication is superior to classical ways of transmitting information.
“We are the first to show a quantum advantage for transmitted information that two parties have to share to perform a useful task,” said Eleni Diamanti, an electrical engineer at Sorbonne University and a co-author of the result along with Iordanis Kerenidis, a computer scientist at Paris Diderot University, and Niraj Kumar.
Quantum machines — which exploit quantum properties of matter to encode information — are widely expected to revolutionize computing. But progress has been slow. While engineers labor to build rudimentary quantum computers, theoretical computer scientists have confronted a more fundamental obstacle: They’ve been unable to prove that classical computers will never be able to perform the tasks quantum computers are designed for. This past summer, for example, a teenager from Texas proved that a problem long thought to be quickly solvable only on a quantum computer can be done rapidly on a classical computer as well.
However, in the realm of communication (rather than computation), the benefits of a quantum approach are certifiable. More than a decade ago computer scientists proved that, at least theoretically, quantum communication beats classical ways of sending messages for certain tasks.
“Mostly people have looked at computational tasks. One big advantage is that with communication tasks, the advantages are provable,” Kerenidis said.
In 2004, Kerenidis and two other computer scientists imagined a scenario in which one person needed to send information to another so that the second person could answer a particular question. The researchers proved that a quantum setup could accomplish the task by transmitting exponentially less information than a classical system. But the quantum setup they imagined was purely theoretical — and far beyond the technology of the time.
“We could prove this quantum advantage, but it was difficult to actually implement the quantum protocol,” Kerenidis said.
Introduction
The new work carries out a modified version of the scenario that Kerenidis and colleagues envisaged. The question addressed in the paper involves two users, Alice and Bob. Alice has a set of numbered balls. Each ball is randomly colored red or blue. Bob wants to know whether a particular pair of balls, chosen at random, has the same color or different colors. Alice wants to send Bob the smallest amount of information she can while still ensuring that Bob can answer his question.
This problem is called the “sampling matching problem.” It has implications for cryptography and digital currency, where users often want to exchange information without necessarily divulging everything they know. It’s also well-suited to demonstrating a quantum communication advantage.
“You can’t just say, ‘I want to send you a movie or something that’s one gigabyte and encode it into a quantum state’” and expect to find a quantum advantage, said Thomas Vidick, a computer scientist at the California Institute of Technology. “You have to look at tasks that are more subtle.”
To solve the matching problem classically, Alice has to send Bob an amount of information proportional to the square root of the number of balls. But the unorthodox nature of quantum information makes a more efficient solution possible.
In the laboratory setup used in the new work, Alice and Bob communicate via laser pulses. Each pulse represents a single ball. The pulses go through a beam splitter, which sends half of each pulse toward Alice and half toward Bob. As a pulse passes by Alice, she can shift something called the phase of the laser pulse to encode information about each ball — whether it’s red or blue.
Meanwhile Bob encodes information about the pairs of balls he cares about into his half of the laser pulses. The pulses then converge in another beam splitter, where they interfere with each other. The way in which the two sets of pulses interfere with each other reflects differences in the way the phase of each pulse has been shifted. Bob can read the interference pattern on nearby photon detectors.
Up until the moment that Bob “reads” Alice’s laser message, Alice’s quantum message is capable of answering any question about any pair. But in the act of reading the quantum message, he destroys it, yielding information about just one pair of balls.
This characteristic of quantum information — that it carries the potential to be read many ways but can ultimately be read only one way — dramatically reduces the amount of information that needs to be transmitted to solve the sampling matching problem. If Alice needs to send Bob 100 classical bits to ensure he can answer his question, she can accomplish the same objective in about 10 qubits, or quantum bits.
“It’s the sort of proof-of-principle stuff you have to do if you’re going to build up a real quantum network,” said Graeme Smith, a physicist at JILA in Boulder, Colorado, who works on quantum technology.
The new experiment is an unalloyed triumph over classical methods. The researchers went into the experiment knowing exactly how much information needed to be transmitted classically to solve the problem. They then indisputably demonstrated that it could be solved in a far leaner fashion by quantum means. “It’s nice in this paper to see people really making a good effort to make sure the thing they’re doing is hard classically, and then doing the hard thing” using quantum methods, Smith said.
The result also suggests an alternative route for achieving a long-standing goal in computer science: proving that quantum computers reign over classical ones. Such quantum “supremacy” has been hard to establish in the purely computational realm, but many important problems hinge on more than just computation.

Their work is featured in a letter published in Nature Nanotechnology.
The researchers, led by U of T Engineering Professor Ted Sargent, created a solar cell out of inexpensive materials that was certified at a world-record 7.0% efficiency.
""Previously, quantum dot solar cells have been limited by the large internal surface areas of the nanoparticles in the film, which made extracting electricity difficult,"" said Dr. Susanna Thon, a lead co-author of the paper. ""Our breakthrough was to use a combination of organic and inorganic chemistry to completely cover all of the exposed surfaces.""
Quantum dots are semiconductors only a few nanometres in size and can be used to harvest electricity from the entire solar spectrum – including both visible and invisible wavelengths. Unlike current slow and expensive semiconductor growth techniques, CQD films can be created quickly and at low cost, similar to paint or ink. This research paves the way for solar cells that can be fabricated on flexible substrates in the same way newspapers are rapidly printed in mass quantities.
The U of T cell represents a 37% increase in efficiency over the previous certified record. In order to improve efficiency, the researchers needed a way to both reduce the number of ""traps"" for electrons associated with poor surface quality while simultaneously ensuring their films were very dense to absorb as much light as possible. The solution was a so-called ""hybrid passivation"" scheme.
""By introducing small chlorine atoms immediately after synthesizing the dots, we're able to patch the previously unreachable nooks and crannies that lead to electron traps,"" explained doctoral student and lead co-author Alex Ip. ""We follow that by using short organic linkers to bind quantum dots in the film closer together.""
Work led by Professor Aram Amassian of KAUST showed that the organic ligand exchange was necessary to achieve the densest film.
""The KAUST group used state-of-the-art synchrotron methods with sub-nanometer resolution to discern the structure of the films and prove that the hybrid passivation method led to the densest films with the closest-packed nanoparticles,"" stated Professor Amassian.
The advance opens up many avenues for further research and improvement of device efficiencies, which could contribute to a bright future with reliable, low cost solar energy.
According to Professor Sargent, ""Our world urgently needs innovative, cost-effective ways to convert the sun's abundant energy into usable electricity. This work shows that the abundant materials interfaces inside colloidal quantum dots can be mastered in a robust manner, proving that low cost and steadily-improving efficiencies can be combined.""";2973;['c5lhyn8', 'c5ljs0a', 'c5li9ks', 'c5ll6rn', 'c5llmnb', 'c5llm81', 'c5linfa', 'c5ll9a5', 'c5lmemp', 'c5lou2q', 'c5lrfxg', 'c5lk31u', 'c5lnga1', 'c5lkrcl', 'c5lq1pr', 'c5lq5s5', 'c5lq7b6', 'c5lriq3', 'c5ls20g', 'c5lz8oj', 'c5ljwt0', 'c5lsi13', 'c5lk5ya', 'c5lisfi', 'c5lmju0', 'c5ljp5u', 'c5ljxyu', 'c5llj7y', 'c5ls70k'];29;1

They’ve developed a highly accurate mathematical approach to predict the behavior of crowds of living creatures, using Nobel Prize-winning methods originally developed to study large collections of quantum mechanically interacting electrons. The implications for the study of human behavior are profound, according to the researchers.
For example, by using publicly available video data of crowds in public spaces, their approach could predict how people would distribute themselves under extreme crowding. By measuring density ?uctuations using a smartphone app, the approach could describe the current behavioral state or mood of a crowd, providing an early warning system for crowds shifting toward dangerous behavior.
Tomas Arias, professor of physics, is corresponding author of “Density-Functional Fluctuation Theory of Crowds,” which published Aug. 30 in Nature Communications. Co-authors include Itai Cohen, professor of physics; lead authors Yunus A. Kinkhabwala, a doctoral student in the field of engineering, and J. Felipe Méndez-Valderrama, a doctoral student in the field of physics; and Jeffrey Silver, senior analyst at Metron Inc.
Interactions among individuals in a crowd can be complex and difficult to quantify mathematically; the large number of actors in a crowd results in a complex mathematical problem. The researchers sought to predict the behavior of crowds by using simple measurements of density to infer underlying interactions and to use those interactions to predict new behaviors.
To achieve this, they applied mathematical concepts and approaches from density-functional theory (DFT), a branch of many-body physics developed for quantum mechanical systems, to the behavior of crowds.
“This is one of the all-too-rare cases – particularly where living systems are involved – where the theory preceded the experiments, and the experiments, in precise mathematical detail, completely confirmed the theory,” said Arias.
“The step of moving this from theory to experiment was not trivial,” said Cohen. “Yunus and Felipe put in a huge amount of effort to figure out how to apply the theory to real systems.”
To test their theory, the researchers created a model system using walking fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). They first demonstrated a mathematical way to extract functions that quantify how much the flies like different locations in their environment – the “vexation” function – and how much they mind crowding together – the “frustration” function based on the details of how the population densities change as the flies more around.
They then showed that by mixing and matching this information with observations of a single fly in an entirely new environment, they could accurately predict, before any observations, how a large crowd of flies would distribute themselves in that new environment. They also tracked changes in the overall behavior of the crowd – i.e., its “mood” – by tracking evolution of the social preference “frustration” function.
While fruit flies were “a convenient, and ethical, first test system,” Arias said, the behavior of a crowd at a political rally would provide a human example of DFT theory. Individuals will try to find the best location to stand – typically closest to the stage – while avoiding overcrowded areas. When new and better locations become available, individuals are likely to move toward them.
To develop a mathematically predictive theory, the researchers associated a number – the vexation function – with the intrinsic desirability of each location; the lowest value would be at the ideal location, closest to the stage. The frustration function accounts for the undesirability of crowding effects, and a behavioral rule accounts for the tendency of individuals to look for better locations.
“The remarkable mathematical discovery,” Arias said, “is that precise values for vexation and frustration can be obtained instantly and automatically, simply by observing changes in crowding as the crowd mills around, without the need for any kind of survey to ask people in the crowd how they feel about different locations or crowding together.”
By varying the social circumstances in their fly experiments – such as changing the ratio of male and female, or inducing hunger and thirst – and monitoring the frustration values of the crowd, the researchers showed they can detect changes in the “mood” of the crowd. The DFT approach, therefore, not only predicts crowd behaviors under new circumstances, but also can be used to quickly and automatically detect changes in social behaviors.
Another application, using cell-phone and census data, could analyze political or economic drivers and population pressures to describe and predict large-scale population flows, such as mass migrations. “The resulting predictions of migration during acute events would enable better planning by all levels of government officials, from local municipalities to international bodies, with the potential to save millions of human lives,” note the researchers.";5207;['e5694rv', 'e55qyz6', 'e55um8z', 'e55u2wi', 'e55jnht', 'e56o55a', 'e55isrj', 'e56tkf1', 'e55tcgy', 'e56clu3', 'e56n53b', 'e56d9z5', 'e56fbkg', 'e56k8b4', 'e56m3jr', 'e56x85k', 'e56xrci', 'e56ylx1', 'e56z4op', 'e570z9n', 'e57100y', 'e572v5m', 'e5796xc', 'e57g6n7', 'e57rcju', 'e56c7vh', 'e56l327', 'e56n41y', 'e56uzf4'];29;1

That’s extraordinary because it would mean that the humans involved in such an experiment would become entangled themselves, if only for an instant.
Gisin is a world leader in quantum entanglement and his claims are by no means easy to dismiss.
Now he’s going a step further saying that the human eye could be used in a Bell type experiment to sense spooky-action-at-a-distance. “Quantum experiments with human
eyes as detectors appear possible, based on a realistic model of the eye as a photon detector,” they say.
One problem is that human eyes cannot se single photons–a handful are needed to trigger a nerve impulse to the brain.
That might have scuppered the possibility of a Bell-type experiment were it not for some interesting work from Francesco De Martini and buddies at the Universityof Rome, pointing out how the quantum properties of a single particle can be transferred to an ensemble of particles.
That allows a single entangled photon, which a human eye cannot see, to be amplified into a number of entangled photons that can be seen. The eye can then be treated like any other detector.
This all looks like fun. The first person to experience entanglement –mantanglement–would surely be destined for some interesting press covereage.
But the work raises an obvious question: why is Gisin pursuing this line? The human eyeball could be put to use in plenty of optics experiments, so why the focus on mantanglement?
Could it be that Gisin thinks there is more to entanglement than meets the eye?";1750;['c07sahk', 'c07s6be', 'c07s541', 'c07s2t8', 'c07s4yi', 'c07s853', 'c07s3ly', 'c07s3oe', 'c07sclf', 'c07s6er', 'c07s3t6', 'c07s6xi', 'c07s9n3', 'c07s3rz', 'c07s54w', 'c07s7lj', 'c07s89y', 'c07s37w', 'c07s4w6', 'c07s9kt', 'c07s9y3', 'c07sebs', 'c07sj0b', 'c07slsc', 'c07sort', 'c07s20j', 'c07s523', 'c07s5dg'];28;1

Quantum computing involves the use of quantum phenomena such as superposition to carry out calculations. Quantum computers use quantum versions of bits (qubits); while bits can be either a 0 or a 1, a qubit can represent 0, 1, or any superposition of these two states. While quantum computers are in very early stages of development, they have the potential to exponentially expand computing power, transforming certain sectors such as cyber security and research.

According to a new blog post (opens in new tab) from IBM Quantum, the company's researchers have, for the first time ever, reported a simultaneous proof along with experimental verification of a new kind of quantum advantage. Specifically they showed that even today's noisy qubits offer “more value than bits as a medium of storage during computations”.
IBM's quantum team thinks of computing in terms of circuits and at the start of a circuit, there are a number of classical or quantum bits. These bits are set to an initial value and then the circuit progresses forward through a user-written program, made up of gates. While different gates have different effects on these bits, the output of this kind of circuit is a set of zeroes and ones in both the classical and quantum case.

- These are the best workstations (opens in new tab) on the market
- Need something more portable? Check out the best mobile workstations (opens in new tab)
When it comes to classical computers, these bits are switches that can either be on or off and interact inside gates that flip switches based on the inputs to this gate. Quantum bits or qubits (opens in new tab) though can take on a combination of these two switch positions and quantum gates create states that incorporate every possible combination of switch positions.
Demonstrating the advantage
In their new academic paper published in Nature Physics titled “Quantum advantage for computations with limited space (opens in new tab)”, IBM Quantum's researchers set out to prove the advantage quantum computers have over classical computers.
They did this by setting up an experiment using circuits restricted to using two-input gates and limited to using one bit of computational/scrap space to answer the question: “How does the computational power differ when a computer has access to classical scratch space versus quantum scratch space?"".
IBM's researchers then proved in their paper that there are functions which a restricted classical computer (opens in new tab) cannot compute but a restricted quantum computer can. To do so, they pitted a real quantum computer against a classical computer.
In order to increase the computational capabilities of the classical computer used in their experiment, the researchers armed it with access to random Boolean (opens in new tab) gates. However, even with access to this randomness, the classical computer was still only able to succeed 87.5 percent of the time while a perfect, noiseless quantum computer would be able to succeed 100 percent of the time according to the findings of IBM's paper.
While today's quantum computers are too noisy to achieve this kind of perfect result, IBM Quantum's researchers still managed to achieve a success rate of 93 percent and beat the classical system when carrying out the experiment in real-life by calibrating special entangling gates to perform these circuits more efficiently.";3270;['h3nrxk5', 'h3o6dhl', 'h3np01s', 'h3opl84', 'h3na03r', 'h3napq3', 'h3n8rka', 'h3o6z87', 'h3oh0x8', 'h3o69bj', 'h3nrxk5', 'h3o6dhl', 'h3np01s', 'h3opl84', 'h3na03r', 'h3napq3', 'h3n8rka', 'h3o6z87', 'h3oh0x8', 'h3o69bj', 'h3p9prs', 'h3qm5zw', 'h3per6g', 'h3p9prs', 'h3qm5zw', 'h3per6g'];26;1

The Department of Energy (DOE) has laid out a blueprint for this “virtually unhackable” internet based on quantum technology — using laws of quantum mechanics to relay information more securely than on existing networks.
The strategy for building a national quantum internet was unveiled during a press conference at the University of Chicago. DOE says it will place the nation at the forefront of the global quantum race.
Back in February, with the help of university and industry researchers, the agency was able to set up a 52 mile (83 km) “quantum loop” in the Chicago suburbs. This makes it one of the longest land-based quantum networks in the US.
The aim is to create a parallel and more secure network based on the concept of quantum entanglement or the transmission of sub-atomic particles. DOE plans to create a prototype for the same in the next 10 years.
“The foundation of quantum networks rests on our ability to precisely synthesize and manipulate matter at the atomic scale, including the control of single photons,” said David Awschalom, a professor at the University of Chicago and senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory.
According to the Energy Department statement, the reasons behind using quantum transmission for a secure internet is that “they are exceedingly difficult to eavesdrop on as information passes between locations” which can help in creating “virtually unhackable networks.”
The agency says that the banking and health services sectors could be the early adopters for the quantum internet. It added that it could also be used for various applications in national security and aircraft communications.

An advanced alien civilization could modify the light coming off of stars in order to communicate across enormous distances, according to a preprint paper published last week by Imperial College London quantum physicist Terry Rudolph.
The idea is that aliens may use entangled photons from various stars to send messages that appear to be random blinking to bystanders, and while this is pure speculation, it is technically conceivable in terms of physics.
How?
Rudolph writes that they've shown that ""free-space diffraction of photons distributes highly useful entanglement."" Quantum entanglement occurs when two or more particles link up in a certain way: No matter how far apart they are, observations of one of the entangled particles can automatically reveal information about the other entangled particles, and any action taken on one of these particles will always have an impact on the others in the entangled system, per NASA.
Receivers of the propagating modes — how radio signals move from a sending antenna to a receiving antenna — may perform distributed quantum computations using just linear optics and photon counting. While distributed computing necessitates traditional communication between receivers, much like standard measurement-based computation, this communication is based on entirely random outcomes and hence might be confused with noise.
But how does this tie with the possibility of us actually spying on alien conversations whenever we look at the sky? To make things a bit clearer, Rudolf's theory is predicated on the idea that a cautious civilization could ""hide their photonic entanglement dispersion by using the thermal light already being emitted by the different starts they visit.""
This would necessitate knowing the number of photons in the modes they've chosen to employ, which would also require performing a quantum non-demolition measurement of the photon number. ""Because the thermal light they are measuring is diagonal in the number basis even this process can be rendered in principle indiscernible to those of us excluded from the conversation,"" Rudolf wrote.
Aliens swiftly communicating across star systems does require some complex physics that can be difficult to grasp, but you learn more about Rudolf's theory by reading the study here. If Rudolf's theory were to be accurate, an advanced civilization colonizing the Milky Way while communicating via stars would explain why no evidence of life beyond Earth has ever been discovered.

If an incoming photon has too little energy, the cell won’t absorb it. If a photon has too much, the excess is wasted as heat. No matter what, a silicon solar cell can never generate more than one electron from a single photon. Such harsh quantum realities severely limit the conversion efficiency of photovoltaic cells, and scientists have spent decades looking for work-arounds.
Now, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Excitonics have published a compelling case that the key to greater solar efficiency might be an organic dye called pentacene. In today’s issue of Science Daniel Congreve, Jiye Lee, Nicholas Thompson, Marc Baldo and six others show that a photovoltaic cell based on pentacene can generate two electrons from a single photon—more electricity from the same amount of sun. Scientists have suspected for some time that this might work; today’s paper is proof of concept.
The key is a phenomenon called singlet-exciton fission, in which an arriving photon generates two “excitons” (excited states) that can be made to yield two electrons. Previous researchers had accomplished similar tricks using quantum dots (tiny pieces of matter that behave like atoms) and deep-ultraviolet light. “What we showed here,” Baldo says, in addition to using visible light, “is that [this process] works very, very effectively in organic materials.”
Why it works is still not particularly clear, and for now, the pentacene cell works only with an extremely narrow band of visible light. But Baldo says it should be possible to create a pentacene coating for silicon solar cells that boosts the total conversion efficiency from today’s 25 percent to a shade over 30 percent—a significant jump. Developing that technology is the obvious next step. “Can we apply this thing as a coating on silicon?” Baldo says. “If we can do that, it would have a pretty major impact on solar cell technology.”";1948;['c9i7y1p', 'c9i7a6q', 'c9iadcl', 'c9i9qrq', 'c9i7m29', 'c9icr50', 'c9ietks', 'c9i80iz', 'c9i9ic2', 'c9ij7kv', 'c9imwix', 'c9ins8f', 'c9iapel', 'c9i9f5s', 'c9ifnyy', 'c9i696h', 'c9i95ja', 'c9i7gz5', 'c9idc27', 'c9inpa3', 'c9ifmmk', 'c9iftwq', 'c9ig86y', 'c9igdrl', 'c9ih59l'];25;1
