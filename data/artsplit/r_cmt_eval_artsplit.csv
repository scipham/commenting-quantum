After the first confirmed extrasolar planet was proven, other planet hunters went back through their data using the new findings and discovered to their chagrin that they, in fact, had found identical data on numerous ES planets beforehand but simply didn't apply the proper imagination to know what they were seeing.
I'm probably screwing this up, but I seem to remember most planet hunters were looking for planets like Jupiter in our own solar system...massive planets a decent distance from their home star that would make the star's wobble fairly easy to detect. However, the first planet confirmed (and, bizarrely compared to ""accepted wisdom"" of solar system formation at the time) was indeed incredibly large but was far closer to its host star than even Mercury is to our own.
It may well be that when the question is finally answered as to the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations...and don't forget that's really what we're looking for. We may well find extraterrestrial life in our own solar system (such as in the vast, ancient oceans of Europa, etc.) but it's advanced life, like our own species that can create a civilization that can even be detected, period, we're really looking for.
It may well be that when the \*\*first\*\* truly verifiable, traceable, reproducible extra terrestrial civilization is discovered, what we learn from it may well show us many more we had already found and just didn't realize them for what they were because they weren't what we were initially expecting.";0;vumwlv;[]

I don't know the science at all, but from what I understand it's essentially two particles are somehow locked on to each other and match each other's states, so when one particle's state is altered, the other shifts to match that state. It can be as far away or have as much signal blocking as you want between them and their states will still match.
I first learned about it from Mass Effect and decided to look it up one day, and to my pleasant surprise, it was an actual thing... in theory. I'm hopeful we get to see something tangible come out of that theory in the future, but I may not be alive for it. Ah well.";0;vumwlv;[]

> As described in Applied Physics Letters,* the NIST refrigerator's cooling elements, consisting of 48 tiny sandwiches of specific materials, chilled a plate of copper, 2.5 centimeters on a side and 3 millimeters thick, from 290 mK to 256 mK. The cooling process took about 18 hours.
It sounds like the object has to be 0.3 kelvin before it's put into the device. So you'd think the device would need to be 0.3 kelvin also to not transfer energy. Is the device placed inside of a freezer or something? How does this work? Or does the device cool the object to 290 mK but it just takes a really long time?
Seems like this would be useful on say a liquid hydrogen container to keep it cold. Especially if it's so tiny.";0;19zx8r;[]

There is no abstract reality that scientific theories are mirroring in their abstract structure. Rather, Science is a model-building enterprise and scientific theories are models which are constructed for practical purposes.
Indeed, with the arrival of clocks, which when they broke down need to replace certain parts for it to work again (patching), we then started to see the world as a piece of complex machinery and our scientific theories began to work like this too (patching + neuromyths). Neuromyths change as Technologies evolve. We project our technological advancement into the most puzzling aspect of Beings, the brain, and the consciousness. With recent advancements in Physics and Quantum phenomena, we started to replace the old way of thinking of the brain and the natural world in general from machine to quantum phenomena... but is this just another neuromyth? Once you get that insight, you can stop dogmatically staying in one single scientific paradigm and can start to see various scientific paradigms as atlases/maps/models of the world and that you can use different theoretical models that are most appropriate for the development of a certain form of technology (which is not mechanical and materialistic in essence, it has become so in the past years).";0;sttmr0;[]

Math works because the human brain keeps trying until it finds a pattern that fits.
We're literally making it up as we go along.
Then revising it until it fits closer to what we observe.
Ad infinitum
And yes, this only works *because* there's an underlying pattern to things. And I suppose you can try and imagine a universe that doesn't have an underlying pattern to it, but it would have to keep going like that, without eventually coalescing into *some* kind of pattern. And then, if there are no patterns, it doesn't seem like anybody would be there to observe it. But even chaos is a pattern of its own. Even no pattern is a pattern of sorts.
The whole thing is just a big grand emergent structure, and our math is just the closest description we currently have of it all, made using our extremely limited ability to observe.
It's not *right* per se, and there's nobody checking but us, and there's no way to check but observe. And it's not complete either, nor will it ever be. Thanks Gdel.
The whole thing IS just eating its own tail. We ARE making the whole thing up as we go along. It really doesn't *mean* anything, and it *is* just the most current convenient description.
The whole thing is because it fell out of itself.
The universe is a paradox from the inside.

Yeah, I'm just going to conclude that our brains aren't very good at math.
I mean, isn't it obvious? We don't do math in an efficient way. We process it like we process other stuff, with a huge amount of neurons. We're able to make some abstractions, like remembering that 5+4=4+5, because of the sheer amount of processing power we use while doing simple math.

I am of course ignoring it's current shortcoming of only working over a short distance, and requiring fiber optics between source and destination to work. However, ignoring the problems to infrastructure with actually implementing QKD, there are a few other weaknesses.
1) Current laser technology requires that you send out a large number of quantum bits, because it is too unreliable to guarantee that a single quantum bit will be generated every time. This means that there are extra quantum bits which could be theoretically intercepted without affecting the rest of the transmission. This means that the inherent security behind QKD is reduced to nothing because ""Eve"" (the attacker in crypto lingo) has only destroyed a few of the quantum bits, rather than the entire communication.
2) Due to limitations in technology, QKD can still be subject to a timing attack, that is measuring the amount of time it takes for the receiving machine to register a quantum bit as either up or down (1 or 0). This is because of minor variations in the distances between the two receptors necessary for measuring a quantum bit. This means that QKD could theoretically be susceptible to a passive attack where Eve measures electrical signals coming from the receiving equipment. (Also important to note that this can be mitigated through random time intervals in the transmission of quantum bits, among other techniques).
3) There is also the risk of a true man in the middle attack where Eve simply measures all the quantum bits transmitted between Alice and Bob, and then simply recreates those bits and forwards them on to Bob. This can be mitigated by precise measurements of the time it should take for a quantum bit to travel between Alice and Bob. If it takes more time than expected, it should be discarded. However, defects in fiber optics and lasers means that Alice and Bob can only measure the time it should take to a certain degree, which would theoretically become less accurate as the distance between Alice and Bob increased. There are other technological weaknesses to QKD, which I can't recall off the top of my head, but the point of all this is to say that while QKD is fascinating technology, and may some day provide the prefect security we are looking for, it is also flawed by our inability to produce perfect machines. There has also been some research into using the laws of thermodynamics to produce a theoretically unbreakable crypto system, but I'll have dig that paper up.";0;1luenb;[]

Even if there is a form of cryptology out there that is beyond cracking, at the end of the day you still have to trust the person who gives that encryption technique to you that it is what it says on the tin.
There is a reason why the state has not acted alone: because the cryptology CAN defend itself. So instead, we have the state force corporations to tweak the mathematical methods of that encryption in their favour upon pain of legal fury. And you would be none-the-wiser when Windows demands another OS update at the bottom-right of your screen.
The problem is still at the end of the day, authoritarian power, as it always has been. It is wrong to assume that the internet can bring democracy. Not when China can set up fake-opposition blogs to lure dissenters into a trap where their IPs can be caught and hence be arrested. Not when Islamic fascists can crowdsource YouTube videos to identify street protesters and have the secret police on them. Not when a regime can get desperate and fire rockets into the servers of the ISPs. Not when copyright law still encourages a Luddite backlash from corporations against the decentralisation of data via file-sharing BitTorrents. Not when the revelation of dissenters in Afghanistan fighting against the Taliban can spread around the world within seconds.
What brings about resisting totalitarianism is the old-fashioned stuff: freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, separating religions from the state, revealing who you are to the world and that your name means business (so anonymity is a utopian idea, too), organising marches, breaking certain laws, and of course using military force against your state to bring about a revolution if need be.

**Steve Gibson explains the problems with quantum communications**
**tl;dr** >...an Internet requires routing. And no one has been able to figure out how to do a quantum router. And you could argue that a quantum router breaks the security because **routing requires looking at the address and then sending it out in the proper direction. And the act of looking at the address means that now you have - you've penetrated the security of the link.** The idea with so-called ""quantum communications"" is that it is utterly secure. It is more secure than any cryptography because, after all, there is a key somewhere; and, if the bad guy knew the key, unlikely as that may be, then they can decrypt what you've got... ...Quantum communications, the whole concept is the act of receiving the information changes it. So the idea is you cannot tap a quantum communication, which is being done by photons over a fiber optic cable. The whole deal is that any - the act of observing the information, in a quantum physics sense, makes that event detectable. I don't know if it collapses the state, or if it alters it. But there is absolutely, I mean, the physicists know it cannot be intercepted or eavesdropped on. Well... we do know from current quantum physics that that is the case. So what has been done is a quantum link has been set up that allows information to flow. And the problem is **an Internet requires routing**. And no one has been able to figure out how to do a quantum router. And you could argue that a quantum router breaks the security because **routing requires looking at the address and then sending it out in the proper direction. And the act of looking at the address means that now you have - you've penetrated the security of the link.** So the way they solve that is they use a **hub** instead of routing. So, like, so all of the nodes have a fiber optic connection into a hub. So, first of all, **now we don't really have an Internet.** Now we have a hub, which is not nearly as exciting because they don't know how to do quantum routing. And you could argue that you can't. Then the problem is, to have it be really secure, they would have to have it go in both directions. But that would require two links, and that would double the cost. And so they said, well, we don't want to do that. Well, okay. ";0;1luenb;[]

Something may be quantum in its initial key-signing or whatever, but eventually it will need to hit a router which will have to route the traffic, ergo it ""turns into"" normal packets rather than magical packets. Assuming the router (not hub) knows the secret exclusively you may be okay.
However, such an exercise (which most quantum security experiments are) are merely academic insofar as they are creating a new mechanism to stop MiTM via a more secure key exchange. My gripe with this is we have things like [Elliptic curve DiffieHellman (ECDHE)]( which more or less 'solve' this issue of Alice, Bob, and Eve. So, you have a few issues despite this:
* SSL2/3 implementation sucks -- particularly almost all implementations are way too backwards compatible. That's to say, it's easy to perform a ""downgrade attack"" since the server ""wants"" ECDHE but will accept lower ciphersuites -- or even SSL2.
* Not all SSL certs are created equally, and only [Extended Validation (EV) Certs]( can truly be trusted to not be tampered with. However, browsers like IE can ""fake"" the green status for EV certs...
There's a different between ""for now"" secrecy and what is termed ""perfect forward secrecy"". The NSA is holding on to encrypted traffic should they flag it, and later-on when companies are re-newing their certs they can give them the old certs + private keys to decrypt the old traffic. With ECDHE ciphers this would be more or less useless and force the NSA to decrypt each set of traffic individually.";0;1luenb;[]

It's also worth pointing out that there are good reasons its a minority research program: any would-be theory of quantum gravity that can't verifiably reproduce general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits really hasn't succeeded in satisfying the first criteria to be taken seriously as a viable contender, and LQG doesn't fulfil either of these requirements.
Anyway as for whether Philosophical Superficiality has harmed physics, I don't think he's said anything remotely convincing on the subject. Everything he says in this paragraph pretty much boils down to the fact that he wishes more researchers would choose his research program, and so he thinks that if theorists were just thinking more deeply or more philosophically, then more of them might agree with him (a dubious notion if you ask me).
So all in all, the link really doesn't contain much of anything meaningful about philosophy. It's more an attempt to invoke philosophy to argue for ideas that otherwise haven't convinced the theoretical physics community.";0;2e9qe8;[]

It seems like he as an issue with people in the field not making guesses that *he* thinks should have been better. His objection seem to be more along of the lines of ""this connection seems so obvious to *me*, so why did everyone else spend so much time on other paths"", and yet he frames it as some deep issue of philosophy involving not taking ""qualitative"" aspects of previous ideas into account(whatever that's supposed to mean). Moreover, his objection in this regard smacks of an anti-scientific concept: knowing what makes sense before thorough testing.
Scientists were lost for decades at a time back in the 19th century when it comes to figuring out the true nature of electromagnetism, while positing all sorts of completely wrong guesses to test. We'd been riding a pretty strong wave of consistent results from their eventual discoveries since, while simultaneously running up against another wall ourselves with respect to integrating quantum theory and relativity. We just happen to be at a new edge which is incredibly difficult to deal with for some fundamental physical reasons that make obvious testing difficult (we're hitting up against the boundaries of what's possible to measure with our current technology).
When people at the edge of human conception about the physical nature of the universe fail to make connections or find better structures within their theories and personal thought experiments, it's not the result of some deep philosophical deficit within the field, it's par for the course because it's unfathomably difficult work.";0;2e9qe8;[]

.
**Horgan**: _Krauss, Stephen Hawking and Neil deGrasse Tyson have been bashing philosophy as a waste of time. Do you agree?_
**Ellis**: _If they really believe this they should stop indulging in low-grade philosophy in their own writings. You cannot do physics or cosmology without an assumed philosophical basis. You can choose not to think about that basis: it will still be there as an unexamined foundation of what you do. The fact you are unwilling to examine the philosophical foundations of what you do does not mean those foundations are not there; it just means they are unexamined._
.
Although, that speaker indulges in his own philosophical philistinian rant himself, IMHO:
.
**Horgan**: _Einstein, in the following quote, seemed to doubt free will: If the moon, in the act of completing its eternal way around the Earth, were gifted with self-consciousness, it would feel thoroughly convinced that it was traveling its way of its own accord. So would a Being, endowed with higher insight and more perfect intelligence, watching man and his doings, smile about mans illusion that he was acting according to his own free will. Do you believe in free will?_
**Ellis**: _Yes. Einstein is perpetuating the belief that all causation is bottom up. This simply is not the case, as I can demonstrate with many examples from sociology, neuroscience, physiology, epigenetics, engineering, and physics. Furthermore if Einstein did not have free will in some meaningful sense, then he could not have been responsible for the theory of relativity it would have been a product of lower level processes but not of an intelligent mind choosing between possible options._
_I find it very hard to believe this to be the case indeed it does not seem to make any sense. Physicists should pay attention to Aristotles four forms of causation if they have the free will to decide what they are doing. If they dont, then why waste time talking to them? They are then not responsible for what they say._

>Here is an example: theoretical physics has not done great in the last decades. Why? Well, one of the reasons, I think, is that it got trapped in a wrong philosophy: the idea that you can make progress by guessing new theory and disregarding the qualitative content of previous theories. This is the physics of the why not? Why not studying this theory, or the other? Why not another dimension, another field, another universe? Science has never advanced in this manner in the past. Science does not advance by guessing. It advances by new data or by a deep investigation of the content and the apparent contradictions of previous empirically successful theories. Quite remarkably, the best piece of physics done by the three people you mention is Hawkings black-hole radiation, which is exactly this. But most of current theoretical physics is not of this sort. Why? Largely because of the philosophical superficiality of the current bunch of scientists.
His over all assessment is that there has been too much focus on building new, hardly verifiable, theories to the detriment of efforts aimed at a better understanding of the contradictions between QM/GR. I have some questions regarding this:
1. Could any physicists chime in and evaluate how accurate the above picture of 'theoretical physics over the past few decades' is? IIRC, string theories have been used successfully to predict some previously difficult to calculate stuff. Furthermore, I have a hard time to believe that theorists' completely forgot about the reasons for their new toy models. I have a feeling that maybe the majority of theorists already understood the problems to a degree where they didn't manage to obtain any new information from the old models' contradictions, and hence started to apply new heuristics to find other possibilities. 2. Even if the above picture is true, how exactly does this stem from any philosophical shortcomings? I agree that it sounds as if people might have forgotten some lessons drawn out of the history of science and some of the succcessful methods for finding new theories *up to modern times*. But why should those methods again be successful? Why are they somehow embedded into one large epistemological truth about how to obtain 'theories'? It seems like a rather unfounded statement to me.
Lastly, I would like to comment on the statement that ""scientists bash philosophy"". This has its roots in both fields. Speaking as a mathematician, there is no feeling whatsoever that there is something philosophy can contribute *to the practical, day-to-day workings* of a mathematician. Whether this is true I do not know. I understand that my intuitive understanding of mathematical objects living somewhere might be wrong, but it yields results and is easily compatible with my intuition, which is really what's doing all of the work. It's a nice thought experiment that it might be wrong, but I will not be gutting myself from my best methods of finding out new maths until you give me an at least equally potent alternative. If you want scientists to have ""sane views"" towards philosophy, then of course it is up to us to listen to you. But it is also up to you to deliver something which helps us do our work. This is often amplified by the fact that many philosophical comments stem from people who have never done science in their life, and subsequently give input which is blatantly unapplicable. And, equally embarassing, are scientists who have never tried to do any serious philosophy making off-hand statement about its general uselessness.

Efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with ligand engineered all-inorganic InP and InP/ZnS colloidal quantum dots. Nature Communications, 2018; 9 (1) DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-06294-y
Link: Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is a promising technique for the direct conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels. Colloidal quantum dots with tunable band gap and versatile surface properties remain among the most prominent targets in photocatalysis despite their frequent toxicity, which is detrimental for environmentally friendly technological implementations. In the present work, all-inorganic sulfide-capped InP and InP/ZnS quantum dots are introduced as competitive and far less toxic alternatives for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in aqueous solution, reaching turnover numbers up to 128,000 based on quantum dots with a maximum internal quantum yield of 31%. In addition to the favorable band gap of InP quantum dots, in-depth studies show that the high efficiency also arises from successful ligand engineering with sulfide ions. Due to their small size and outstanding hole capture properties, sulfide ions effectively extract holes from quantum dots for exciton separation and decrease the physical and electrical barriers for charge transfer.";0;9kq3l4;[]

I'm not sure if it is exactly the same process as the one he mentioned, but he told me a big part of the process of creating this energy with water required aluminum and the aluminum is practically destroyed and or unusable after this process. So this sort of thing long term is not gong to be a solution to our problems. I think a lot of people should seriously watch the anime series: Fullmetal Alchemist for their very interesting theory about a ""rule of equivalent exchange."" Translating outside of the clear fantasy aspects of the animation, it basically states that something of equal value must be used to ""create something."" Basically they realize that there is no such thing as ""renewable"" anything and that this is a flawed ideology. I 100% believe that nothing on this planet is ""renewable"" and that for us to continue existing ""long term"" we need to take a much more conservative route to our resources. Precious minerals should only be used for advancement of technology that ACTUALLY benefits humanity, so no more smart phones, no more computers, no more dish washers, no more clothes washers and dryers, no more cars, etc. You cannot ""infinitely"" cycle anything and we have proof of this in the food cycle. Every time you drink water, eat food, etc. some of this energy is lost as heat or simply through the process of turning the materials into usable energy our bodies can use. If you drank a glass of water, urinated through a filtration system boiled that leftover liquid and drank it, you do this enough times and the only thing you're going to be left with is waste material that will not give you any benefit by consuming it. At least this is my current understanding. Sure that energy htat is lost in heat or evaporated will go through the atmosphere, rise up, collect together, form clouds, then rain etc. we all know the water cycle.... This takes a lot of time to happen. not nearly as much as the earth forming precious minerals. Yeah aluminium is one of the cheapest materials on the planet, but it won't be for very long if we use it for energy.
I mean shoot even batteries are limited, that lithium or Ion is being ""used up' in those batteries, so even 100% battery operated vehicles will eventually create waste that will be extremely toxic to our environment. ";0;9kpha3;[]

At its heart lies the private key / public key pairing, secured by SHA256 encryption. If you could try all combinations simultaneously, as with a quantum computer, you could help yourself to the contents of any account.
Bitcoin mining essentially involves being the first to find a SHA256 match or getting close. A quantum computer would make this trivial. Bitcoin does not have an easy upgrade mechanism, so I'm not sure what will happen.
Ethereum are soon moving away from mining. The community has for years recognised quantum computing as an issue, and are relaxed that they have a solution to the private key / public key pairing problem (not sure what it is). They have an established mechanism for upgrading.

With a quantum computer, binary code can simultaneously express 1 and 0, making its processing and computational capability magnitudes greater than current computers. If in the wrong hands, this can disrupt all aspects of digital life. Security of websites/financial organisations would need to somehow encrypt data to become quantum-resistant. However, if quantum computers are made and can be accessed by the wrong people, we would have far greater issues to worry about anyway, imo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But it's already proven that they can. At least currently used methods like ecdsa in bitcoin. Shor's algorithm can break ecdsa, but is impossible to perform on normal computers. But it works on quantum computers. Haven't had time but the article probably also states, that other signature algorithms will be needed. But those haven't been tested yet to be capable of handling the security requirements of a trillion dollar cryptocurrency. A while ago I read about a probably quantum-secure digital signature algorithm based on supersingular isogenies, that is thought to be quantum safe. But bringing those algorithms to big cryptocurrencies would be hard. As everyone would need to link his new adress to his old. And then after a while all old adresses would be invalid, if they didn't transfer their assets over to a new quantum-secure adress.";0;pi7q5u;[]

In one fame measurement A could occur before measurement B, but in another B could occur before A.
It's true that WF collapse can give correlations between two detectors, which may naively be thought of as requiring speeds faster than c to occur but this correlation can't be used to generate a FTL signal.
An analogy: Suppose Alice is separated from Bob by such a distance that light takes 1 minute to travel between them. Bob and Alice are both tossing coins in which the sequence appears random to each, but which are magically correlated with the other, such that if Bob gets HHTHTT, then Alice gets HHTHTT. Also, suppose that this correlation occurs even if Alice and Bob are tossing the coins within a few seconds of eachother, such that no photon could pass between them in the seconds between Alice and Bob each toss their coin. The correlation could be said to occur faster than light, but note- since the sequences appear random, neither Alice or Bob can exploit that correlation to transmit a signal, like 'Put the kettle on'. Furthermore, according to relativity, an observer traveling at a different speed could find that Alice was actually tossing the coin before Bob, or vice versa. In other words, the order in which A+B perform their tosses depends entirely on the observer.";0;1bavah;[]

Here's my problem with this experiment as described: the timing measurement described above requires detecting a change in state of photon Bfrom ""no definite polarity"" to ""definite polarity""following the collapse of the wave function of photon A. Three problems with this:
1) How, precisely, is such a state change detected? 2) Wouldn't such a state-change measurement collapse the wave function of photon B? If so, how could such a timing measurement be made, since multiple state change measurements have to be made to determine the timing?
3) If you really could detect when photon B transitioned from ""no definite state"" to ""definite state"" due to the collapse of photon A's wavefunction, you'd have a way to transmit information faster than the speed of light: using a lineup of photons A1, A2, A3, ... entangled with B1, B2, B3, ..., you could vary the time between collapses of A series photons to transmit binary information, and detect those variances by detecting those state changes using the B series photons.";0;1bavah;[]

Couldn't entangling two particles just simply predetermine their states and from then on appear as if they're communicating when they aren't?
I will remain skeptical as long as I can about FTL interactions until it's thoroughly proven that these molecules aren't just giving predetermined values that match up only because of a prior ""entanglement"" that might just put their future states in an inverse parallel (or whatever it may be) to each other.
For example: If you drop two balls from the same height they will fall at the same rate, that rate is predetermined from the moment you drop them. If you measure the velocity of one ball you will instantly know what the other ball's velocity is because both values are predetermined.
Quantum interaction to me seems like a more complicated version of dropping 2 objects and believing that they are interacting because they fell at the same rate.";0;1bavah;[]

What's If Bell's theorem is being interpreted too broadly here? Isn't it easier to believe that Quantum theory has some holes in it than to believe in quantum teleportation?

>In a new study due this week in the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Rice University theoretical physicist Qimiao Si and colleagues at the Rice Center for Quantum Materials in Houston and the Vienna University of Technology in Austria make predictions that could help experimental physicists create what the authors have coined a Weyl-Kondo semimetal, a quantum material with an assorted collection of properties seen in disparate materials like topological insulators, heavy fermion metals and high-temperature superconductors. >All these materials fall under the heading of quantum materials, ceramics, layered composites and other materials whose electromagnetic behavior cannot be explained by classical physics. In the words of noted science writer Philip Ball, quantum materials are those in which the quantum aspects assert themselves tenaciously, and the only way to fully understand how the material behaves is to keep the quantum in view. >These quirky behaviors arise only at very cold temperatures, where they cannot be masked by the overwhelming forces of thermal energy. The most celebrated quantum materials are the high-temperature superconductors discovered in the 1980s, so named for their ability to conduct electrical current without resistance at temperatures well above those of traditional superconductors. Another classic example is the heavy fermion materials discovered in the late 1970s. In these, electrons appear to be effectively hundreds of times more massive than normal and, equally unusual, the effective electron mass seems to vary strongly as temperature changes. ";0;7kwv02;[]

In any case, the article ignores the other side of the equation, which is the charging stations ability to supply current. If you want to charge the battery in half the time you need twice the current. If you want to cut the time from 20 minutes to 1 minute, youd need 20x the charging current. To achieve the charging time these guys are talking about would require so much power that each charging station would potentially require hundreds of kW or even a megawatt of instantaneous power capacity.

Like for instance I was at work yesterday and they were talking about how lumber is going through the roof, I didnt say it but I was thinking I dont know how thats possible when lumber is a 100% renewable resource. We can literally grow trees.
Weve been being subtly tricked by the way they report and speak on things. Sure they make items, like chips and motherboards and processors.
But those things come from elements found in nature:
Like for instance lithium I dont think the chip shortage is because of supply chain thats a lie I think, I think its because Africa is slowly becoming more and more independent abd they are taking their resources, which led to china trying to push their way in, which didnt work too well, then all of a sudden, all of these ways to get people into buying gpus became a thing.crypto and nfts.

Rydberg polaritons switch continually from light to matter and back again. In Rydberg polaritons, light and matter are like two sides of a coin, and the matter side is what makes polaritons interact with each other.
This interaction is crucial because this is what allows the creation of quantum simulators, a special type of quantum computer, where information is stored in quantum bits. These quantum bits, unlike the binary bits in classical computers that can only be 0 or 1, can take any value between 0 and 1. They can therefore store much more information and perform several processes simultaneously.
This capability could allow quantum simulators to solve important mysteries of physics, chemistry and biology, for example, how to make high-temperature superconductors for highspeed trains, how cheaper fertilizers could be made potentially solving global hunger, or how proteins fold making it easier to produce more effective drugs.";0;u6w5xr;[]

Preliminary definition: An exciton is a type of ""particle"" that can form on a crystal with certain properties. It's basically an electron and an electron hole (i.e. a place an electron should be but isn't, usually because it gained energy somehow and moved out of the valence band) that are attracted to one another, since they have opposite charge. This allows a material to transport energy in the form of the motion of the exciton, without transporting any charge, since the electron is negatively charged and the electron hole is positively charged, so they're electric dipoles that are overall neutral much like a hydrogen atom.
The experiment used a cavity resonator, which is basically a specially shaped container that bounces photons back and forth in it. It has what's called a resonant frequency, which means that only photons of particular frequencies are able to bounce back and forth inside it. They did this to make sure they're only using photons of a particular wavelength.
The crystal (the one imported from Namibia) they used has a particularly high Rydberg constant, which is a rare property in most materials. Because it has such a high Rydberg constant, it admits excitons of correspondingly high energies with reasonably high lifetimes (around 300 ps). Higher-energy excitons react more strongly to photons (i.e. they're strongly coupled). The final state that they were trying to produce were Rydberg exciton-polaritons, which are just excitons that are strongly coupled to photons.
So they put the crystal into their resonator and tuned their light to create excitons in the crystal. The excitons were able to couple strongly to the photons, and they were able to produce Rydberg polaritons of larger sizes and higher energies than previously seen.";0;u6w5xr;[]

Here is the paper.
Important considerations from the article.
>Scientists from Trinity College Dublin believe our brains could use quantum computation. Their discovery comes after they adapted an idea developed to prove the existence of quantum gravity to explore the human brain and its workings.
>The brain functions measured were also correlated to short-term memory performance and conscious awareness, suggesting quantum processes are also part of cognitive and conscious brain functions.
And.
>""Because these brain functions were also correlated to short-term memory performance and conscious awareness, it is likely that those quantum processes are an important part of our cognitive and conscious brain functions.
>""Quantum brain processes could explain why we can still outperform supercomputers when it comes to unforeseen circumstances, decision making, or learning something new. Our experiments, performed only 50 meters away from the lecture theater where Schrdinger presented his famous thoughts about life, may shed light on the mysteries of biology, and on consciousness which scientifically is even harder to grasp.""

> The aim of this study was to show that the brain is non-classical. We assumed that unknown brain functions exist which can mediate entanglement between auxiliary quantum systems. The experimental detection of such an entanglement created by the brain would then be sufficient to prove cerebral non-classicality. We found experimental evidence that such entanglement creation occurs as part of physiological and cognitive processes. We argued that the ZQC signals were non-local because (a) ZQC signals were above the classical bound, and (b) the signals had no SQC and MQC correlates. Further, we could confirm that the signals were only detectable in combination with reduced classical signals (necessary condition), and that they resembled HEPs which are below verifiability in conventional MRI (sufficient condition). Our findings may disapprove the statement that quantum entanglement or coherence can't survive in the hot and wet environment of the brain. Beyond the fundamental question we tried to answer here, we found an undiscovered NMR contrast, which can detect brain activity beyond conventional functional MRI. It may have interesting applications in psychology and medicine.";0;y8ufdr;[]

If the brain is also using quantum resources, then the organ still isn't anything like what we think of when we talk about a ""quantum computer"". Maybe the speedup is confined to subcellular processes? Or maybe it's the exact opposite?
This idea is at least as old as Schrodinger's ""What Is Life?"" (which was apparently read by undergrad James Watson) but it got less popular after the 60s. The book ""How the Hippies Saved Physics"" paints a rosy historical picture of this, but in reality I think one too many gurus getting proto-metooed, plus incidents like the Waco seige, and Woodstock #1 through the one in the 90s where a Hell's Angel killed a guy, maybe all these kinda soured the public perception of Deepak/Hameroff guru-types dressed like Jedis instructing people about quantum souls or whatever.
Doesn't change the fact that photosynthesis, avian magnetoreception, and even freaking gecko feet have evolved to make use of nontrivially nonclassical resources.

To put it in simple terms, the problem we have in Quantum Communication is that we cannot use light amplifiers to regain our signal loss due to the no cloning theorem in quantum mechanics. Therefore we need to find another way to transmit our info to farther limits. Quantum memory has been a solution since it would allow us to store a photon and retrieve it later on at a certain desired time. Unfortunately many fundamental problems are still unsolved despite the progress.
As for those who wonder what entanglement is. Imagine you have two objects that can either give you a value of 1 or 0. If they are entangled, then you can take those objects as far from each other as possible and if one is measured with a value of 0, then the other will also take the value of 0 when it will be measured. That way, entanglement provide a certain transportation of the data.

>The big advantage, though, is this scheme also allows something that looks like quantum routing. The basic process is that the photonic qubits are generated from matter qubits at one end and stored into matter qubits at a node. The storage process involves the emission of photons that can be used to determine the channel losses and appropriately decode the actual quantum data from the block. But, unlike point-to-point schemes, the decoding process doesn't involve measuring the quantum state, it only involves picking the right bits and performing operations on them. This is important, because a measurement would destroy the quantum state. Since the quantum state is preserved, it can be re-encoded in a new block and sent on to a new node.

If we were to create a stream of photons and anti-photons (or any particle and its generated opposite) in an accelerator, stream the first particle set in the accelerator in a loop and send anti-particles toward the target destination, then we should, by changing the polarity of the first particle set one particle at a time, be able to note the immediate change in the polarity of the received particle as a sort of binary code.
Think of it as + + - - + + (or whatever), giving us a binary information set. We know that when you create particles and their anti-particles in an accelerator and change the polarity of the first, the second changes instantly with no ""speed of light"" limitations on the (what I call) quantum information bundle. So with a proper stream of anti-particles to a destination and a cycling supply of particles here, if we could accomplish the engineering I don't see why it isn't possible, from a pure particle physics standpoint, to have instant communication across great distances.

The challenge of storing quantum information is that quantum information is stored in spins. An electron can have two different spins, and the difference in energy between two spins is veeeery small, typically. This means that anything that provides more energy than that difference can alter the spin state. Room temperature thermal fluctuations are enough to alter the spin state, preventing a successful quantum application. Being able to store a spin state for 1.3 s is super impressive. What's also impressive is that they can do this with erbium, which is useful for telecommunications. If you wanted to send a quantum state from one place to another, the most common mechanism is to convert the state to a single photon and shoot it at your desired location. The problem with this is that most of the places you want to send quantum info aren't in eyesight, and it's hard to send light through solid things because they absorb. An alternative solution is to use a fiber, which can transport photons. However, fiber rely on bouncing a photon back and forth constantly to prevent it from escaping and direct it to the destination. During these bounces, if there is any imperfection, the single photon with your quantum state will be absorbed and lost. But, we can reliably transport photons about 20 miles. The trouble is, without any other technology, you'd only be able to pass quantum states 20 miles. A quantum repeater is one possible way to avoid this problem.
Imagine that every 20 miles, the photon was re-absorbed by one of these erbium crystals, and then launched again to preserve its quantum state. This would help you overcome the 20 mile limit and the ""eyesight"" restriction. ";0;6zmbnt;[]

This is because when an observer is present, the computer uses particles to render with maximum detail, but when the observer is not present the computer uses waves to conserve memory. If this is true, then we would also expect anti-matter to follow the same pattern because it is being rendered by the same computational process and limits. That is what this discovery means to me, anyway.
Edit: I say ""what this discovery means to me"" and want a discussion, yet all the replies are totally sure of themselves and more filled with insults than information.
Maybe the one piece of information in these replies is the idea the particle detector is the observer. But what does that mean really? It's a collision of a photon with atoms. An interaction of fields that can behave as waves when they're not colliding and particles when they are. And if that's wrong, I would love better information in a constructive way. Maybe this is a better way to articulate my thoughts about the experiment. I think it's showing that matter and anti matter are interactions of the same fields. Now, I imagine those fields as computational in how they interact. Conjecture? Sure. Impossible to prove? I doubt it.";0;bmc6mw;[]

What we think of as matter are standing waves in the medium of space, continuously propagated by the incoming perturbations of all other material in the universe, which focus their energy into a volume considered to be the atomic nucleus.
Waves by themselves are not physical entities. There is no such thing as a wave. A wave is not an object in of itself, but an action which an object performs.
A wave cannot propagate without some medium in which it can oscillate. For decades popular science has denounced the idea of the luminiferous aether, but logically no other situation is possible.

Quantum encryption relies on the fact that you can verify a transmission has not been intercepted, as an independent observer world collapse the superposition. Does this experiment prove that this is not the case after all?
What if both observers write down their result on a piece of paper, would the result on that paper be different for everyone who looks at it?
What if a major decision, such as the election of a president were based on such a random result rather than a vote? Would the Butterfly Effect ripple from there and cause each person to live in either reality A or B? I could live in a world where Trump was in power, yet my wife would live in a world where Clinton won. Normal physical 'randomness' (like a coin toss) is a sum of many probabilities that collapse in a predictable result as long as you know enough about the initial conditions, so that we mostly follow the same timeline.

Quantum Teleportation sounds magical but imagine you have a bit in one place. Then you derive two bits that, when you xor them together they give you the original bit. You send them to a new place, xor them together, and suddenly the bit exists in that new place too! The magical thing about quantum computing is that quantum bits can't be copied so when you create the quantum bit at the new place it disappears from the original location. And the process is different from xoring.;0;peuhzn;[]

If I understand the patent language properly, the invention is relatively simple, and explainable with a basic idea of what a (classical) CPU does.
We want a quantum computer to run a program across multiple ""SIMD Regions"" over multiple cycles -- in this model, each region runs zero or one operations per cycle, and can only hold the data it is working with.
Quantum computers store and work with information in ""qubits"". It is not possible to copy qubits; moving a qubit is called quantum teleportation. While quantum teleportation is a normal and common part of a quantum computer, each move adds noise to the results, so we want to do it less.
The prior approach to managing a qubit is that at the start of every cycle:
* If a region needs it, move it there
* Else if its region is idle (i.e. has no operation), leave it in place * Else move it to global memory
The patent approach is:
* If a region needs it, move it there
* **Else if another region is idle, and will use the qubit when it stops being idle, move it there**
* Else if its region is idle, leave it in place * Else move it to global memory
So this allows for a direct copy in more cases, saving one move each time.";0;pghepu;[]

So the best title of all would be scientists discover a currently useless principle of quantum computing that could, when developed and expanded significantly, allow them to un-collapse a waveform inside a quantum computer and therefore better understand its function and improve said function

A lattice of entangled quantum particles, (given enough time to ""spread out"") will weave together to form space-time.

It also seems like this theory is trying to project the phenomena of entangled qubits forming +1 dimensions from there own, to explain why we perceived 4 dims as our consensus reality. While M/String theory predict their to be 11/10 dims in total, with the others curled up in to CalabiYau manifold. I wonder how this theory co-exist with those...
Also, I am unsure how much we can transpose phenomena occurring in an anti de Sitter space to that of a Hilbert space, like our own consensus reality.

If there was a 2D universe that expanded as far as the current universe, could it not be folded into a single point in the 3rd dimension yet still seem so extremely expansive to whatever perceives the universe as 2D? From a 3D perspective they'll be twisting, turning, and bending through the countless folds in a single point, but to them it'll feel like they're moving in their normal X and Y coordinates because they do not perceive the 3rd dimension.
Likewise, could we not say that a 3D universe could be folded into a single point in the 4th dimension, yet our movement in the 3rd dimension will seem normal as we only perceive X, Y, and Z coordinates? However in the 4th dimension we'd simply just be twisting, bending, and warping in a single point?
In this case, actions at a distance wouldn't be all that spooky, it's simply perceived that way. In our 2D world, something could travel to any point in the perceived universe in a split second simply by moving in the 3rd dimension. In the 3rd dimension, one could travel to any point in the universe in a split second my simply moving in the 4th dimension. Realization is that everything is just a single point and you aren't actually moving.
Of course this isn't reality because I can't just 'move' in the 4th dimension.";0;bm6sq4;[]

> Physics theory used to predict crowd behavior
> Theyve developed a highly accurate mathematical approach to predict the behavior of crowds of living creatures, using Nobel Prize-winning methods originally developed to study large collections of quantum mechanically interacting electrons. Journal Reference:
J. Felipe Mndez-Valderrama, Yunus A. Kinkhabwala, Jeffrey Silver, Itai Cohen, T. A. Arias. Density-functional fluctuation theory of crowds. Nature Communications, 2018; 9 (1) DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05750-z
Link: Abstract
A primary goal of collective population behavior studies is to determine the rules governing crowd distributions in order to predict future behaviors in new environments. Current top-down modeling approaches describe, instead of predict, specific emergent behaviors, whereas bottom-up approaches must postulate, instead of directly determine, rules for individual behaviors. Here, we employ classical density functional theory (DFT) to quantify, directly from observations of local crowd density, the rules that predict mass behaviors under new circumstances. To demonstrate our theory-based, data-driven approach, we use a model crowd consisting of walking fruit flies and extract two functions that separately describe spatial and social preferences. The resulting theory accurately predicts experimental fly distributions in new environments and provides quantification of the crowd mood. Should this approach generalize beyond milling crowds, it may find powerful applications in fields ranging from spatial ecology and active matter to demography and economics.

The DFT approach, therefore, not only predicts crowd behaviors under new circumstances, but also can be used to quickly and automatically detect changes in social behaviors.

I work on DFT algorithms for nanoscale particles, but it's always cool seeing novel applications. A few things to point out:
1. While DFT was developed to model quantum systems there isn't much inherently ""quantum"" about it. The ""density functional"" part of the name gives a lot away actually. The whole purpose of the theory is to re-formulate complex interactions of objects in approximate terms based on the density of the interacting objects, which seems like a natural choice to model crowds behavior.
2. While the future applications section is getting a lot of attention, it is worth noting that the paper only studied highly controlled systems of fruit flies.

For example a ship able to accelerate at a constant 1g could get all the way to the galactic center in something like just 20 years for the ship's crew.

I find this hard to accept, if only because it is provable that time passes slower at higher altitude/lower gravity - if you have two atomic clocks and put one at the top of a mountain, the mountain clock will measure less time passing when you reunite them.

The next step is to figure out how to bring down the astronomical amount of energy needed to within the range of today's technologies, such as a large modern nuclear fission power plant. Then we can talk about building the first prototypes,"" says Lentz.
This paragraph would lead a lot of readers to the idea that the scale of energy required isn't so far away from what we can currently produce, whereas it's *a lot* further away from a current nuclear power plant than a cave man's fire is.
> Currently, the amount of energy required for this new type of space propulsion drive is still immense. Lentz explains, The energy required for this drive travelling at light speed encompassing a spacecraft of 100 meters in radius is on the order of hundreds of times of the mass of the planet Jupiter. The energy savings would need to be drastic, of approximately 30 orders of magnitude to be in range of modern nuclear fission reactors. He goes on to say: Fortunately, several energy-saving mechanisms have been proposed in earlier research that can potentially lower the energy required by nearly 60 orders of magnitude. Lentz is currently in the early-stages of determining if these methods can be modified, or if new mechanisms are needed to bring the energy required down to what is currently possible.
Since there's not a lot on what the energy saving methods are it's hard to judge what this work really means. However I wouldn't bother calling an engineer and asking for some energy just yet!";0;m1gyyi;[]

This sounds like a *horrible* outcome for space travel. Humans need to carry an ecosystem with them; machines wear out and break down. Why would we intentionally remove the time dilation advantage of relativistic travel?

Photons are bosons with no spin, electrons are fermions with +1/2 or -1/2 spin. By conservation of spin you **MUST** produce an even number of electrons.
Okay, so they are just talking about [multiple excitation](, which is neither special nor does it break quantum efficiency, there is no such thing. ";0;1cn6gu;[]
