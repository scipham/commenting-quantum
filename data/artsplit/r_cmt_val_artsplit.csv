It seems some people would like to know what's going on with quantum teleportation.
It is conceivable that quantum teleportation could one day be very similar to teleportation of science fiction, but you gotta do it right. Today's teleportation technology works on single particles. So let's say we want to teleport particle A... What we need is another particle (B) which looks the same as the first one. The act of teleportation is to take the quantum state of particle A and transfer it to particle B. There you go, teleportation done.
But, doesn't that sound like duplication, not teleportation? It does, except for the fact that the state of particle A after teleportation is *fundamentally and necessarily* destroyed. The identity has been transferred from A to B.
You might say ""I don't care, it's just making another thing like the first one, nothing was teleported."" But isn't that good enough? Imagine in the future when this can be done for larger composite objects and we teleport a person. If the entire state of the object is transferred (including the state of the brain which contains all our memories and personality etc.), then isn't that as good as teleporting? (Of course, we don't yet totally understand consciousness, maybe there is more to ourselves then our physical state but bear with me.)
So then the picture you should have is that when something needs to be teleported, you need a dummy object at the receiving end to be ""teleported on to."" Who knows, maybe you can just spray a fine mist of material to be used to recreate the object. Or any teleportation machine would be a 2 step process, replicate, then teleport.
It's a bit unnerving to think of how this works with people, essentially you would make a dead clone of you at the destination. Then you would be killed when your quantum state is sucked out of your body, and your body will be disposed of. Then the quantum state will be inserted into the clone and will pop back into life with all your memories etc. I wonder if it will hurt...";0;c6llq;[]

No one is galaxy-hopping, or even beaming people around, but for the first time, information has been teleported between two separate atoms across a distance.
Teleportation is one of nature's most mysterious forms of transport: Quantum information, such as the spin of a particle or the polarization of a photon, is transferred from one place to another, without traveling through any physical medium. It has previously been achieved between photons (a unit, or quantum, of electromagnetic radiation, such as light) over very large distances, between photons and ensembles of atoms, and between two nearby atoms through the intermediary action of a third.";0;c6llq;[]
