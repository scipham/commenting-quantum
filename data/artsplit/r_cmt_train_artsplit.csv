Whereas the bits of a normal computer are binary 1s or 0s, on or off the processing rate ofquantum computersis much faster because they utilize 'qubits,' which can be 1 and 0, on and off at the same time. One way to build a quantum computer would be to link myriad time crystals, each one designed to act as a qubit. Therefore, this first experiment to link two time crystals has created the basic building block of a quantum computer.
Previous experiments have already shown that some time crystals can operate at room temperature, rather than needing to be cooled to nearly absolute zero, making their construction even easier. The next task, Autti's team said, is to demonstrate that logic gate operations, which are functions that allow a computer to process information, can operate between two or more time crystals.
The research was published June 2 in the journalNature Communications.";0;van9q0;[]

If so would looking at one of them break the entanglement for all of them?
If so, could that be used as a cheat to send messages faster than light?
Because if you had one person with 2 particles mutually entangled with a third that was light-years away. Those 2 particles would be perfectly synchronized, but if someone looked at the 3rd particle, the 2 would immediately become desynchronized, and that would instantly tell you that the 3rd was observed.

A quantum computer isn't faster than a regular one, at least for a ""traditional application"". The key point of quantum computers is that, due to some quantum properties, it should be able to solve some family of problems exponentially faster.
And how fast is exponentially faster? it depends on the size of the problem. The basic idea is that it could solve a problem that takes 2^n time in a regular computer in, say n^2 time, and that is HUGE. With those scales, a problem of size 100 would go from needed 4.01702815 10^22 years to solve to a mere ~2 hours.

The first application will be GPS, and logistics. Next will be encryption. Finally cloud based OS and basically all processing being outsourced to central quantum computers. Google will want people to use their processing power, as its AI/fancy programming will basically consume all the information on the Internet.

Quatum physics says that everything has an infinite amount of states called superposition (think parallel universes), meaning that a qubit (quantum computer bit) can reveal all possibilities at once.
Another mindblower: quantum mechanics says that reality only starts to exist when it is observed. You could say that we are all computers that render our reality. Because there are an infinite amount of possibilities in life, our observation forces particles like electrons to collapse into the outcome we finally observe. Why is this? Because particles exist in waveform and will collapse into mass when observed. For those who played Minecraft will maybe understand.

The study has big implications for quantum information technology - the future of how sensitive information is shared and stored.
The researchers published their results on June 28, 2019 in Communications Physics.
""Quantum teleportation permits the transfer of quantum information into an otherwise inaccessible space,"" said Hideo Kosaka, a professor of engineering at Yokohama National University and an author on the study. ""It also permits the transfer of information into a quantum memory without revealing or destroying the stored quantum information.""
The inaccessible space, in this case, consisted of carbon atoms in diamond. Made of linked, yet individually contained, carbon atoms, a diamond holds the perfect ingredients for quantum teleportation.
A carbon atom holds six protons and six neutrons in its nucleus, surrounded by six spinning electrons. As the atoms bond into a diamond, they form a notoriously strong lattice. Diamonds can have complex defects, though, when a nitrogen atom exists in one of two adjacent vacancies where carbon atoms should be. This defect is called a nitrogen-vacancy center.

No, there is too much. ELI15:
Classical computers store and work with information in binary form. Each unit of information called a bit: either 0 or 1. It can be stored in many forms, like whether electricity is or isn't flowing through a transistor, or magnetic information on a disk drive, or even just 0s and 1s written in pencil on a sheet of paper. What matters is the information itself.
Quantum computers store and work with *qubits*. Each unit of information is _both_ 0 and 1 at the same time, with a certain probability. This can be expressed as a complex number (a real plus imaginary), called the [probability amplitude]( Like a bit, this can be stored in many forms, like the polarization of a photon or the spin of an electron.
However, unlike a classical bit, you _could not_ just ""write down"" a sequence of qubits on a sheet of paper and then recreate them in some other quantum computer. The state of a bit is either 0 or 1; but the state of a qubit is represented by a complex number that could require infinite precision.
But sometimes you do want to move quantum information from one place to another, or transfer it from one computer to another. This is where ""teleportation"" comes in. You use a special trick (details not important right now) that causes a qubit in one location to lose its quantum state while a qubit in a different location gains that state. (If you're curious, this does not transfer information faster than light: in order to finish the process, you have to also transfer two classical bits of information using good old fashioned legwork)
The interesting thing in this article is that the researchers didn't just transfer quantum state from one electron to another, or one photon to another, which has been done regularly. They were able to transfer state from ~~an electron~~ (**Edit**: a photon) to the nuclear spin of an atom, which is much easier to work with and store, and could be used to build quantum computers much more easily. **Edit**: These researchers have also previously transferred quantum state to the nuclear spin of the nitrogen defects in diamonds, but those defects are rare. Now they can transfer onto ^(13)C atoms, which are very abundant in diamonds.";0;c6j2vp;[]

Submission statement:
Quantum computing (QC) is one of the biggest topics regarding the future of tech, much like machine learning/ai, there is a lot of potential but the current state of progress is often exaggerated to the highest degree. In many ways this runs parallel to the state of self driving technology. It's always a few months around the corner yet that has been said for years at this point. I have no doubt it will get there eventually but the exaggerations are ~~exhausting~~ misleading.";0;x5d6j2;[]

It has a solid enough background to warrant further development so stopping it before it's actually able to produce results because it doesn't produce results now is an impatient mindset.

In the end, I don't feel all that bad for large investors because they can afford to hire a genuine expert as a consultant before they commit to an investment. Also, I imagine at least some of them understand the situation, but have enough money they're not necessarily going to miss and think that there might be enough potential to justify the risk.
I think the main worry is that if the bubble bursts, there won't be adequate funding for anything related to quantum computing, including legit research projects. I don't know if he expresses this particular worry, but that's what would concern me.
What bugs me personally is to see funding wasted on glossy start-ups which probably don't amount to much more than a fancy PowerPoint filled with jargon instead of being poured into PhD programs - and not just at MIT and a select few others, but at various universities across the world. There are smart people everywhere, but one of the reasons many universities can't work on concrete solutions is because they can't afford the materials, tech, and partnerships. You also have people bogged down by side jobs, needing to support a family, etc. which can scatter focus and limit the amount of research-related travel they can do. Adequate funding would lessen these burdens and make it easier for researchers to work together and to take some risks as well.";0;x5d6j2;[]

Nikita Gourianov is a physicist at Oxford university that works with computational quantum physics. Here he argues that people have become wildly over-optimistic on the prospects of quantum computing.
Financial bubbles occur when large groups of investors repeatedly make poor investment decisions, often due to greed, misunderstanding and easy money. A modern-day example of this is quantum computing.
Quantum computing is often portrayed as an up-and-coming technology whose eventual impact will only be rivalled by artificial intelligence. According to the quantum evangelists, it is only a matter of time before a fully-functional quantum computer will appear and do everything from revolutionising drug development to cracking internet encryption schemes.
Billions of dollars have poured into the field in recent years, culminating with the public market debuts of prominent quantum computing companies like IonQ, Rigetti and D-Wave through 2021s favourite frothy market phenomenon, special purpose acquisition vehicles (Spacs).
These three jointly still have a market capitalisation of $3bn, but combined expected sales of about $32mn this year (and about $150mn of net losses), according to Refinitiv. Heres what their stocks have done this year.
The reality is that none of these companies or any other quantum computing firm, for that matter are actually earning any real money. The little revenue they generate mostly comes from consulting missions aimed at teaching other companies about how quantum computers will help their business, as opposed to genuinely harnessing any advantages that quantum computers have over classical computers.
The simple reason for this is that despite years of effort nobody has yet come close to building a quantum machine that is actually capable of solving practical problems. The current devices are so error-prone that any information one tries to process with them will almost instantly degenerate into noise. The problem only grows worse if the computer is scaled up (ie, the number of qubits increased).
A convincing strategy for overcoming these errors has not yet been demonstrated, making it unclear as to when if ever it will become possible to build a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer. Yet according to the evangelists, we are apparently in the middle of a Quantum Moores Law (aka Roses Law, after D-Wave founder Geordie Rose) analogous to the microchip revolution of the 1970s 2010s.
Another fundamental issue is that it is unclear what commercially-useful problems can even be solved with quantum computers if any.
The most prominent application by far is the Shor algorithm for factorising large numbers into their constituent primes, which is exponentially faster than any known corresponding scheme running on a classical computer. Since most cryptography currently used to protect our internet traffic are based on the assumed hardness of the prime factorisation problem, the sudden appearance of an actually functional quantum computer capable of running Shors algorithm would indeed pose a major security risk.
Shors algorithm has been a godsend to the quantum industry, leading to untold amounts of funding from government security agencies all over the world. However, the commonly forgotten caveat here is that there are many alternative cryptographic schemes that are not vulnerable to quantum computers. It would be far from impossible to simply replace these vulnerable schemes with so-called quantum-secure ones.
And the uncertain practical viability of Shors algorithm is only the tip of the iceberg. There has been much controversy regarding where and when quantum computing can actually offer any practical advantage. The latest research points out that there is no evidence that even quantum chemistry calculations can be significantly sped up with quantum computers. That is bad news for the much-touted idea of quantum computers being useful for drug design.
In essence, the quantum computing industry has yet to demonstrate any practical utility, despite the fanfare. Why is then so much money flowing in? Well, it is mainly due to the fanfare. The views of scientists are still (mostly) respected in society, and so when physicists get excited about something, people notice.
The excitement truly began in the 90s, which saw a range of pioneering breakthroughs that truly marked the birth of quantum technologies as an academic field. As more progress was made over the years, the excitement grew, eventually going well beyond the community.
By the 2010s capital had become cheap, and investors started taking notice, even if they had no real understand of the technology (beyond the a qubit can simultaneously be both one and zero clich). As more money flowed in, the field grew, and it became progressively more tempting for scientists to oversell their results. With time, salesman-type figures, typically without any understanding of quantum physics, entered the field, taking senior positions in companies and focusing solely on generating fanfare. After a few years of this, a highly exaggerated perspective on the promise of quantum computing reached the mainstream, leading to a greed and misunderstanding taking hold and the formation of a classical bubble.
Some physicists believe, in private, that there is no problem here: why not take advantage of the situation while it lasts, and take the easy money from the not-too-sophisticated investors? Earning a private-sector level salary whilst doing essentially academic research is a pretty good deal, after all.
Well, when exactly the bubble will pop is difficult to say, but at some point the claims will be found out and the funding will dry up. I just hope that when the music stops and the bubble pops, the public will still listen to us physicists.";0;x5d6j2;[]

The author is right in that there is a big difference between the scale of machines that we have now and of those that will be commercially useful.

It is now outside the scope of national funding bodies without a Los Alamos-sized effort (which is impossible in the current political climate) and we certainly won't get there by incrementally improving the devices we have in academic labs. There are only two options to deliver on the technology in any meaningful timeframe: be an incumbent tech company with deep pockets, or find venture capital.

If you go read the original article he says that Shor's algorithm isn't that large a threat since we can just change to other quantum proof encryption schemes. The strategic element Gourianov misses is that we currently use breakable encryption and encrypted data can simply be captured and retained. You don't need to break stolen or captured information today, you can simply hold it until its breakable and retroactively reveal secrets.

I know that for example the pilot wave interpretation of quantum mechanics has its own (mathematical) quirks while being equivalent in its results and predictions to the more accepted Copenhagen and many world interpretations. But Pilot waves can explain the phenomenons with much less ""magic"" involved--so there is a chance we do NOT live in a computer simulation with lazy rendering after all...
Essentially, in pilot wave theory you assume a guiding wave plus a particle ""swimming"" on the wave. The particle is what you measure in the end but its position is guided by the wave. So when you gate the path after the particle has passed, you still collapse the wave and alter the particle's path removing observed interference. Problem is, the guiding wave has to propagate instantaneous, but that's easier for my mind to accept than many other theories. And the second big problem is that you cannot prove this interpretation, as you cannot directly prove any other interpretation with the current theory. You can just reject it due to Occam because the math is less elegant.

The other guy looks at the 2 slits with a telescope. He might be lightyears away. But as soon as the information comes to him and he knows if the particle went trough slit A or B, the other observer would see a different picture. That would allow information transfer at over light speed, wouldn't it? Because the particles which pass through the slit and go to the screen only take a finite time to get to the first observer.

Also the Bose Einstein condensate ""matter laser"" can be used to make super sensitive interferometers for use in hunting for gravitational waves and the like. This is all way too exciting!

Finally, there are tons of things that could be emulated and not be measured, i.e. there are infinite things which do not exist that would need processing if nature bothered with that. Since the number of things which do not exist are far greater than the things that exist, nature would be in trouble emulating them all.

Further, at microscopic levels, it's true that determinism and certainties are not completely likely, but only statistical. Still, 99% likely isn't easy to ignore as the effect/event will persist almost all of the time.
The border zone between macroscopic events and quantum event levels are a real conundrum in physics. Why does this transition occur and how does it come about are real questions. But reality has to be better defined than the authors above have even TRIED to do, & that of course is the writing ethic being maimed once again.
In quantum reality particles can move thru others by quantum tunneling, simply going around the distance. IN macroscopic world, electrons prevent that, mostly. Entanglement and other weird events can occur, whereas a simple interaction with said particle and another can cause its loss of entangling. The odd characteristics of Bose-Einstein condensates are getting more and more well defined, too, within the probabilities. And it's fairly clear that even on the quantum level, light speed is only a probability, not a certainty, too. Otherwise, how would we measure light speed with only say 20 photons? We'd come up with some which moved faster than cee and others near cee and others more slowly. It's only when vast numbers of photons are measured under set conditions that light speed arises as a constant. The universe is a lot fuzzier at quantum levels than macroscopically.";0;38yywm;[]

* The cryptography underlying crypto isn't unique to crypto--it's used in a TON of fields. Which is to say, there are A LOT of vested interests in not having cryptography by broken. Which leads to point two:
* Even if QCs are improving and advancing, SO TOO IS CRYPTOGRAPHY. It's not a static field, there are a lot of very smart people working it, and there are huge swathes of the economy--again, way bigger than crypto--riding on keeping things private/secure/encrypted.
* Aside from any of that, [the odds of cracking the encryption underlying crypto are low](, and are relatively easy to make even lower even without getting into significant advances in current encryption technology.
TL;DR, these stories are almost always making a fuss about a non-issue. Yes, QCs are something to be aware of and prepare for. That's already happening, and most reputable blockchains already factor QC resistance into their plans.";0;xz0qo7;[]

But in any case, if there at some point should be QC become available that are getting more energy efficient than ASIC, that will only mean another hash power increase similar to what we have seen from CPU -> GPU -> FPGA -> ASIC
The real danger of QC is that there is an quantum-algo that can calculate a private key from a public key. With Bitcoin, the address is actually a double hash of the public key, and the public key is only revealed once you spend the coin. So if you follow best practice and don't reuse addresses you already have some form of quantum resistance.
That being said, obviously Bitcoin would need to adopt a new quantum resistant asymmetric algo to make it impossible again to calculate the private key from a public key. AFAIK that would just be a new address type and only need a soft fork.

ALL Blockchains, use the same list of numbered 2048 words called BIP-39 to create all the Seeds Phrases, its not random words as some might think. Due to the limitations of the BIP-39 word list at some point sometime in the far far far far future all combinations will be achieved.
Now the good news that most people dont know about, with your Cold Wallet you can set up a 25th word (Algo is using 25 words by default) wich can be anything you want, all it has to be between 2 and 100 letters long, and it does not need to be a word, it can be anything you want, it's sensitive to caps and can be composed of numbers and signs as well.
The benefits of the 25th word is that it creates a whole new set of privet/public keys.
You can have as many 25 words as you want

For one, if the information is being stored in photonic qubits, then the qubits themselves don't really have a ""temperature"". Temperature is a bulk property of matter and photons are single particles (sure, you can define effective temperatures for some other systems, but for single photons it doesn't really make sense). Similarly, the article seems to imply that people are avoiding storing the photons in big freezers? It's a strange thought to say the least.
I have only read the abstract of the paper so far, but as far as I can tell the important thing here is that they are using an atomic vapour to generate single photons, and it is that vapour which is at room temperature. There have also been experiments which use ultracold vapours to generate single photons, but it's important to know that an ultracold vapour doesn't necessarily mean a big freezer cooling things to <1 K. It often is just a vacuum chamber and an atomic cloud that has been *laser* cooled, while the apparatus itself remains at or slightly below room temp. The advantage over those systems is not needing those cooling stages, as many magnetic field coils, etc etc.
Edit: I'll also add that I think there have also been other types of quantum memories demonstrated with storage times on the order of milliseconds (and I think even seconds). Again the advantage here seems to be simplicity.";0;o3ro5d;[]

>D-Wave founder Geordie Rose claims that D-Wave has now accomplished its goal of building a quantum computer that, in his words, is better at something than any other option available. This claim has been widely and uncritically repeated in the press, so that much of the nerd world now accepts it as fact. However, the claim is not supported by the evidence currently available. It appears that, while the D-Wave machine does outperform certain off-the-shelf solvers, **simulated annealing codes have been written that outperform the D-Wave machine on its own native problem when run on a standard laptop**. More research is needed to clarify the issue, but in the meantime, it seems worth knowing that this is where things currently stand.

This is quantum encryption. Not true ""quantum communication"" like something via quantum entanglement. Best case scenario is more security but the same speed as before. Worst case is slower speeds due to some extra computational overhead. For those more interested this seems pretty mixed for covering the three goals of data security. It should provide very good confidentiality for the time being (a way to break the encryption will be discovered, mark my words). Integrity is a mixed bag since there is always the issue with quantum wave forms collapsing where you MAY not get what was intended (how ever small a chance it may be). Then we have availability. It provides VERY poor availability. Instead of a threat actor needing to establish a large network of bots to initiate a ddos or similar attack, one must simply try to read the communication to end it. A simple slave dish directed at the satellites could end all outbound quantum communication by simply observing the packets. That's bad (unless another mechanism I'm not aware of is in place to prevent this scenario).
Then we have one other issue.... That's the personal. Any one working in security fields knows that users screwing up (intentionally or not) is probably our biggest risk right next to improper implementation and configuration (think equifax or the iCloud hacks from a while back). One time quantum pads will help, but only so much. We'll see. And now I wait to be told why I'm wrong :) ";0;a963g1;[]

The problem is simple, the more signal you have the less well it works until you simply can't get the signal through.
People seem to completely fail to grasp that there are different definitions to the word ""quantum"" and communication by it has NOTHING to do with computing with it.
Our data is 1's and 0's and converting it all to random 0.387's and 9.elephant's isn't going to make it any faster. If all the data has to be processed repeatedly and re-sent from both ends several times to deal with errors it is much simpler just to use binary and checksum.

* Google purchased a machine from a Canadian company called [D-Wave](
* This computer does something called [quantum annealing](
* It has not been shown to solve any problems with time scaling better than is possible in principle on a classical computer.
* It cannot factor large numbers -> it cannot crack RSA and related encryption schemes.
* D-Waves scientific publications are terrible and pretty obviously crafted to make as little definitive claims as possible. I saw their presentation at the American Physical Society meeting last March and the only compared their machine's performance to a badly chosen selection of classical algorithms that had *not* (as far as I could tell) been optimized for the problem at hand.
* [Here is a technical paper]( that actually analyzes quantum annealing and the D-Wave machine in an honest, clear scientific manner.
* [Here is a previous thread]( in which I try to explain how the D-Wave machine works. Other posts in that thread are quite enlightening as well.

If a qubit's intrinsic novelty is the fact that it can exist in multiple states at the same time, then how does **observation** factor into this technology, if at all?

Some argue that Dark Matter is real, and it is in fact a kind of matter... a kind of ""stuff""... most likely made up of a type of particle we haven't discovered yet. It is believed to be a particle that has mass (thus gravity), but doesn't interact very strongly with regular matter or light. --------------------------------
Others argue that it is NOT actual matter or stuff, but rather some kind of strange property of the Universe. They usually argue it is some kind of misunderstanding of gravity, just as this latest article is trying to do, by arguing that gravity is somehow an emergent phenomena of quantum entanglement, or quantum effects of some sort. --------------------------------
But... the problem is... is that there is ever increasing evidence that points towards Dark Matter as being real stuff. A kind of undiscovered particle most likely, that has mass. --------------------------------
One of the big problems with the opposite theories, that say there is NO such thing in space known as ""Dark Matter""...
Is that we've actually used Dark Matter for scientific purposes! Yes, we've made use of it, before we even understand what it is! Essentially we've used Dark Matter to act as a giant gravitational lens, to enhance and magnify distant objects behind the Dark-Matter cloud. And sure enough, Dark Matter functions perfectly as a gravitational lens, in exactly the same way regular matter functions as a gravitational lens. --------------------------------
There is also other evidence that Dark Matter is real ""stuff"", such as the fact that we've recently discovered galaxies with no Dark Matter effects. So if you're going to argue that the effects of Dark Matter is an inherent property of the Universe, or a misunderstanding of gravity (rather than actual material stuff) then why do some places in the Universe appear not to have that inherent property you are trying to argue for? Essentially properties and forces work the same throughout the Universe. But matter is not spread out evenly in the Universe. --------------------------------
So again... if Dark Matter was a property or force, then you would see it acting the same on ALL galaxies. But some galaxies have virtually no Dark Matter effects what-so-ever. In cases like that it makes much more sense to awesome Dark Matter is real stuff, and that the concentration of that stuff is simply lower in some parts of the universe, and higher in other parts of the universe (just as ""normal"" matter also concentrates). --------------------------------
FURTHER... The oscillation of the Cosmic Microwave Background supposedly provides very strong support to the idea that Dark Matter is stuff. If Dark Matter was not stuff the oscillation would be different. (Admittedly I personally don't really understand that particular oscillation-evidence, as it's not something I've read up on yet.) --------------------------------
There's yet more evidence for Dark Matter as ""stuff"" and a ""particle"" but I'll stop here!
In short, the vast majority of astrophysicists I tend to follow seem increasingly more certain that Dark Matter is real matter... A strange kind of matter we do not yet understand...
But matter that we've already been able to use to our advantage (such as gravitational lensing)!

there's a lot in there that's a lot more subtle and depends precisely on which space we're talking about (de sitter space, anti desitter space, real space...) that I have not satisfactorily described but I believe this to be the essence of the argument
it would be very interesting to see whether the ultra diffuse galaxy lacking dark matter mentioned elsewhere in the thread is above or below this acceleration scale, which presumably is how it was inferred no dark matter exists in that galaxy, though someone more familiar with the matter can perhaps elaborate on how that conclusion was drawn";0;8hr8en;[]

He said we call it dark matter because we're just assuming that where there's gravity it must be caused by matter, so we should call it dark gravity.
He said we don't really understand gravity so we don't really know that you can't have gravity without matter somehow.
It's just assuming that there's Dark Matter behind this gravity to call it that. There might be some other cause for the gravity that isn't matter.
It's not right to think about it as dark matter. We should call it dark gravity. They're trying to explain the existence of some unexplained gravity, not necessarily trying to find missing matter.
Tyson was right we should call it dark gravity.";0;8hr7hw;[]

A discovery of a galaxy that has no ""dark matter"" and that spins much in accordance with standard gravity but otherwise has the same characteristics as galaxies that spin faster than predicted by standard gravity.
""Dark matter"" supporters can say that this galaxy seems to have significant clump of dark matter and this other galaxy does not, similar to how some solar systems have planets and others don't.
Verlinde and MOND cranks have no such luxury: Gravity can't behave one way for one galaxy and then a totally different way for a another similar galaxy. They've painted themselves into a corner.
Also Verlinde theory is a lot of taking existing math and re-writing it to show linkage between two different entities. But like most of String Theory, he fails to make any new testable predictions that go beyond the verified predicitons that the existing math makes.

What is observed is that the deviations that we see in the rotational curves of galaxies, which is just derived by looking at the matter that we see, always seems to occur at one particular acceleration I expect that Mr. Verlinde is observing the ""particular acceleration"" at which spontaneous particle generation (dark matter) is occurring. In keeping with my own model of a Steady State Universe, this matter is generating in areas of lesser resistance, which coincides with areas of lesser gravitation. I further expect his study to bear witness to what is the same phenomena, only expressed by different cognitive models - one of which is not accounting for the increasing mass between celestial bodies.

Also I was able to talk to some cryptographers about the expectations. First - google's project is explicitly not targetting ""breaking crypto"", but of course you can tell from Google's projects (SHAttering.io) etc. that they do look to advance the strength of crypto, and will use very expensive public demonstrations to motivate the industry. At the time of RWC'17 (january) they had about 9 qubits operating.
Also the presenter provided an explanation for what they mean by ""Quantum Supremacy"", which they hoped to achieve last year. What they mean is to be able to do at least one task, any task, faster and more efficiently than a classic CMOS computer. When he explained this, there was an audible groan in the audience and follow up questions begging that the phrase not be misconstrued in the press. The press release covers this, it will be interesting (but really, unsurprising if not) if the press manages not to blow it out of proportion.
That said, quantum computing is coming and will likely be put to cryptographic tasks faster than is publicly acknowledged. It's possible government research (US, China, Russia, etc) are a few years ahead of publicly acknowledged capabilities. From a Cryptography engineering perspective, this means making sure we can flex to new requirements and capabilities, the [NIST Post Quantum Cryptography]( (non) competition is the defensive thing to watch. Right now though there are a lot of other things to work on to defend against classic threats, like preventing key compromise through breach, theft or leak...

A team of physicists say they managed to create a new phase of matter by shooting laser pulses reading out the Fibonacci sequence to a quantum computer in Colorado. The matter phase relies on a quirk of the Fibonacci sequence to remain in a quantum state for longer.
Just as ordinary matter can be in a solid, liquid, gas, or superheated plasmic phase (or state), quantum materials also have phases. The phase refers to how the matter is structured on an atomic levelthe arrangement of its atoms or its electrons, for example. Several years ago, physicists discovered a quantum supersolid, and last year, a team confirmed the existence of quantum spin liquids, a long-suspected phase of quantum matter, in a simulator. The recent team thinks theyve discovered another new phase.
Quantum bits, or qubits, are like ordinary computer bits in that their values can be 0 or 1, but they can also be 0 or 1 simultaneously, a state of ambiguity that allows the computers to consider many possible solutions to a problem much faster than an ordinary computer. Quantum computers should eventually be able to solve problems that classical computer cant.
Qubits are often atoms; in the recent case, the researchers used 10 ytterbium ions, which were controlled by electric fields and manipulated using laser pulses. When multiple qubits states can be described in relation to one another, the qubits are considered entangled. Quantum entanglement is a delicate agreement between multiple qubits in a system, and the agreement is dissolved the moment any one of those bits values is certain. At that moment, the system decoheres, and the quantum operation falls apart.
A big challenge of quantum computing is maintaining the quantum state of qubits. The slightest fluctuations in temperature, vibrations, or electromagnetic fields can cause the supersensitive qubits to decohere and their calculations to fall apart. Since the longer the qubits stay quantum, the more you can get done, making computers quantum states persist for as long as possible is a crucial step for the field.
In the recent research, pulsing a laser periodically at the 10 ytterbium qubits kept them in a quantum statemeaning entangledfor 1.5 seconds. But when the researchers pulsed the lasers in the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence, they found that the qubits on the edge of the system remained in a quantum state for about 5.5 seconds, the entire length of the experiment (the qubits could have remained in a quantum state for longer, but the team ended the experiment at the 5.5-second mark). Their research was published this summer in Nature.
You can think of the Fibonacci sequence laser pulses as two frequencies that never overlap. That makes the pulses a quasicrystal: a pattern that has order, but no periodicity.
The key result in my mind was showing the difference between these two different ways to engineer these quantum states and how one was better at protecting it from errors than the other, said study co-author Justin Bohnet, a quantum engineer at Quantinuum, the company whose computer was used in the recent experiment.
The Fibonacci sequence is a numeric pattern in which each number is the sum of the two previous numbers (so 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). Its history goes back over 2,000 years and is connected to the so-called golden ratio. Now, the unique series may have quantum implications.
It turns out that if you engineer laser pulses in the correct way, your quantum system can have symmetries that come from time translation, said Philipp Dumitrescu, the papers lead author and a quantum physicist who conducted the work while at the Flatiron Institute. A time-translation symmetry means that an experiment will yield the same result, regardless of whether it takes place today, tomorrow, or 100 years from now.
What we realized is that by using quasi-periodic sequences based on the Fibonacci pattern, you can have the system behave as if there are two distinct directions of time, Dumitrescu added.
Shooting the qubits with laser pulses with a periodic (a simple A-B-A-B) pattern didnt prolong the systems quantum state. But by pulsing the laser in a Fibonacci sequence (A-AB-ABA-ABAAB, and so on), the researchers gave the qubits a non-repeating, or quasi-periodic, pattern.
Its similar to the quasicrystals from the Trinity nuclear test site, but instead of being a three-dimensional quasicrystal, the physicists made a quasicrystal in time. In both cases, symmetries that exist at higher dimensions can be projected in a lower dimension, like the tessellated patterns in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling.
With this quasi-periodic sequence, theres a complicated evolution that cancels out all the errors that live on the edge, Dumitrescu said in a Simons Foundation release. By on the edge, hes referring to the qubits farthest from the center of their configuration at any one time. Because of that, the edge stays quantum-mechanically coherent much, much longer than youd expect. The Fibonacci-pattern laser pulses made the edge qubits more robust.
More robust, longer-lived quantum systems are a vital need for the future of quantum computing. If it takes shooting qubits with a very specific mathematical rhythm of laser pulses to keep a quantum computer in an entangled state, then physicists had better start blasting.";0;y8unmi;[]

Physicist here, phonons and photons are the same kind of particle at theoretical level. Both are excitations of fields - photon the electromagnetic field while, phonons quantum electronic fields of periodic potential (lattice) Just like any other quantum particles both can be created and destroyed while also existing in other weird combination of those creation and destruction. Phonons are very well understood objects and Infact one of the main reasons for superconductivity in materials. Phonons have very major role in lot a of everyday technologies, right from solar cells to semiconductors. For instance, these phonon particles can interact with electrons in solid and entirely change the property of the material. Phonons are most prominent at higher temperatures (since they are excited states of lattice vibrations, higher the temperature more the lattice jiggles and more energy the phonon gets). Its very comon in physics to model excited states of systems as particles, for instance, there are excited states of a particle made up of both photon and phonon- it is called polariton and an excited state of photon and exciton ( exciton is electron and positron combined) which is called a polaron and so on. They beauty of quantum physics is that when you combine elementary particles (electrons) they interact so complexly that they give birth to new quasi particles which can be described (to a very good approximation) as non interacting particles. For further reading, read about the beautiful idea of emergence in condensed matter physics
I have got tons of messages asking about other quasi particles. Heres not so exhaustive list of em. -	Fermi electrons -	Phonons
-	Cooper pairs -	Excitons -	Polrons -	Polritons -	Weyl fermions -	Dirac fermions
-	Nodal fermions
-	Majorana fermion. You read it right ! Last one is the most esoteric of the lot as it is its own antiparticle. Its as of now a theoretical construct and these are very very hard to isolate and observe. Once found experimentally , these are the perfect candidates for Qi it for quantum computing without a shadow of doubt and probably will fetch you a noble prize too!

The vibrational motion is then restricted to the stationary eigenmodes of the resonator, which thus serves as local storage for phonons. In contrast, we couple propagating phonons to an artificial atom in the quantum regime and reproduce findings from quantum optics, with sound taking over the role of light. Our results highlight the similarities between phonons and photons but also point to new opportunities arising from the characteristic features of quantum mechanical sound. The low propagation speed of phonons should enable new dynamic schemes for processing quantum information, and the short wavelength allows regimes of atomic physics to be explored that cannot be reached in photonic systems.;0;cyg5vi;[]

There is no sound particle. Sound is a result of other particles colliding. Sound is a wave and only a wave. Comparing sound to photons is very misleading. Photons are particles that also have wave properties. They are both particles and waves. If a photon were just a wave it couldnt travel through a vacuum, if a photon were just a particle it couldnt interfere with other light waves. A sound wave can interfere with other sound waves but it cant travel through a vacuum. Sound is only a wave.
It is sometimes useful to treat very specific types of vibrations as particles mathematically. When you do this you call your particle a quasiparticle. A phonon is a type of quasiparticle that comes from a specific mathematical treatment of vibration. It is true that sound can be caused by vibration. But calling a phonon the quantum of sound is incredibly misleading and inaccurate.";0;cyg5vi;[]

How many actual quantum computers would you say exist in the world today? I know that is a difficult question because their are almost certainly some unknown ones (NSA, Military, Foreign Government, etc...), but if you had to make an educated guess what would you say?
Ive seen the photos of IBMs quantum computer, and it looks extremely complex/expensive. At the rate that we are currently developing quantum computers, how long would you guess it would be before the first commercially produced ones will be purchasable for the general public (if ever).
I remember reading a theory about quantum computers (that arent programmed with advanced AI) actually being so capable that they could eventually create a sentient AI (singularity) without humans creating said AI. Is that actually a possibility?
Last one. So cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are mined by powerful processors that have to solve complex problems in order to be rewarded with the currency. The more powerful/capable your mining hardware is, the more you can earn. Could one of these advanced quantum computers pretty much takeover a crypto mining sector by outperforming standard computer hardware?

Hey though good for them... they are getting funding for some reason, and they wont even be able to develop languages till they can hold states in a human time frame. Fun idea but moron science, mostly, because of the extreme temps required. That being said the science is paramount. I'll lay it down real fast, simply put original computers used switches to hold 1's and 0's (tubes on/off) and that's the same pretence we use today. They are using ""quantum states"" (not even sure quantum physics is an actual science) instead of on/off. The simplification (like the switches being a simplification of a transistor) would be somthing like spheres filled with fluid. Many more positions increases computing power (but you need machine level languages, current ones were developed in the 50's/60's).
Thats the idea... couple decades ago they were gonna use extreme temps to make fusion... needless to say the simularities extend beyond temperature.

I'm pretty sure I understand this and will try to ELI^(1)5 for you. (I am speculating in the last part of this as it was not spelled out in the article.)
**Part the first**: *how things are done now.*
1. Radio signals are very weak.
2. An amplifier stage increases the signal strength to something more useable
3. A demodulation circuit converts the amplified signal from one of the many analog-domain modulation techniques (AM/FM/PSK) to the digital realm.
**Part the second**: *why this doesn't work at very large frequencies.*
1. Demodulation circuits make use of ""large scale"" circuits consisting of, for example, op-amps and tank circuits, or signal mixers and phase shifters.
2. The elements in these circuits have ""large"" inherent capacitance.
3. Capacitance causes a lag between the introduction of current and a corresponding rise in voltage level.
4. When the frequency you are trying to detect gets high enough, there is not enough charge flow to create a detectable voltage change; ergo, the signal is not detectable.
**Part the third**: *Tunneling transistors are very sensitive.*
1. Tunnel FET transistors can be actuated with minuscule voltage changes --- the kind of voltage changes that correspond to radio waves without amplification.
**Part the fourth**: *What would happen if you hooked up a plain FET vs. a T-FET to an antenna as a pure current switch (rather than an amplifier)?*
1. For a T-FET, anytime the incoming signal was high, the T-FET would conduct, and when the incoming signal was low, the T-FET would not conduct. The average antenna voltage would be 0v, and the T-FET would be on about 50% of the time and produce a steady stream of current. Not very useful.
2. For a FET, the transistor would never activate.
**Part the fifth**: *New graphene transistors can be switched from FET to TunnelFET.*
1. It's great that Tunnel FET transistors actuated with very little voltage, but that doesn't make them useful for much directly (in terms of RF).
2. The new graphine transistor can be switched from FET to TunnelFET on demand: a very sensitive radio-wave detector one moment, an insensitive normal FET the next, then back again.
**Part the sixth** (Speculative): *Future research will be to switch these graphene transistors from T-FET to FET at THz frequencies*
1. If you peek at the incoming antenna voltage at time intervals that match a carrier frequency's peaks, the voltage will not, on average, be 0.
2. If you switch the transistor from FET to T-FET in time to the carrier frequency's peaks, the transistor is only ""looking"" at the antenna when the carrier is at a maximum value.
3. While in T-FET mode, on average, the T-FET should be ON more than it is OFF if the carrier is present, but only on 50% of the time if the carrier is not present (due to off-carrier RF noise).
4. If the output of this T-FET/FET hybrid is low-pass filtered by a very tiny capacitor (say, that naturally present on the input stage to an amplifier), you should be able to detect when the carrier is present vs. not present: a simple two-element AM detector operating at THz frequencies.
**TLDR**: ***A contemporary radio receiver consists of many elements that do not respond quickly enough to decode Thz information. The new transistors offer a way to build a radio receiver that consists of only two elements (in the signal path) that respond much more quickly and can demodulate much higher frequencies.***";0;ld51by;[]

This has been demonstrated with record-breaking speed and accuracy. The breakthrough is set to resolve a major challenge in building quantum computers **large and powerful enough to tackle complex problems that are important to society.** > Currently, quantum computers operate on the 100-qubit scale, but to answer crucial problems that cannot be solved by todays supercomputers, experts predict that millions of qubits will be required.1,2 There is a global quantum race to develop quantum computers that can assist in complex societal challenges, such as drug discovery and improving the energy efficiency of fertiliser production.
> In a new research paper scientists demonstrated how they have used a novel technique, called UQ Connect, to use electric field links to enable qubits to move from one quantum computing microchip module to another with unparalleled speed and precision.
> The scientists were successful in transporting the qubits with a 99.999993% success rate and a connection rate of 2424/s. These numbers are both world records and orders of magnitude better than previous solutions. While linking the modules at world-record speed, the scientists confirmed that the quantum nature of the qubit remains untouched during transport. For instance, the qubit can be both zero and one at the same time.";0;10z0gme;[]

I was shown an old physics book that stated a radio can never be made smaller than the length of the tuning bar so tiny radios are impossible due to physics. Then they made the tuning ""bar"" into a tight coil of wire.
I was told in the 80's that it is impossible to create a hologram of a human due to the physics (movement on the order of 1/2 the wavelength of visible light destroys holograms). Then they just had very bright, short flashes that exposed the film fast enough that humans did not have time to move.
I was told a modem for my computer (early days of dial-up) can never be faster than 28.8 Kbps because of physics. I don't know how they fixed this but even through old copper phone lines we were getting 56 with a year or two later.

This experiment was done with phosphorous atoms in a solid. In order to actually use those atoms as quantum bits (qubits) you have to be able to control them and have them interact with one another. Long life time and strong coupling are at odds with one another. To get strong coupling you need your qubit to have enough electric or magnetic field to be felt by the thing with which you want it to interact. On the other hand if the qubit interacts with stuff you didn't intend then you get bad coherence.
Atoms are really small and have weak electromagnetic properties. This makes it relatively easy to get high coherence times, but really really hard to get good coupling. A practical quantum computer must negotiate this trade-off properly.

At the end of the day, the ability to keep these particles in their state for however long is a feat, but as far as quantum computers being involved, I don't see why it's even mentioned. The qubits don't seem to be manipulable, can't communicate with each other (which would be needed for any computing), demonstrated nothing about superposition theories, and nothing was actually *done* as far as calculations were concerned.

Quantum computers, which harness the superposition and entangle-
ment of physical states, could outperform their classical counter-
parts in solving problems with technological impactsuch as
factoring large numbers and searching databases1,2. A quantum pro-
cessor executes algorithms by applying a programmable sequence of
gates to an initialized register of qubits, which coherently evolves
into a final state containing the result of the computation. Building a
quantum processor is challenging because of the need to meet simul-
taneously requirements that are in conflict: state preparation, long
coherence times, universal gate operations and qubit readout.
Processors based on a few qubits have been demonstrated using
nuclear magnetic resonance35, cold ion trap6,7 and optical8 systems,
but a solid-state realization has remained an outstanding challenge.
Here we demonstrate a two-qubit superconducting processor and
the implementation of the Grover search and DeutschJozsa
quantum algorithms1,2. We use a two-qubit interaction, tunable in
strength by two orders of magnitude on nanosecond timescales,
which is mediated by a cavity bus in a circuit quantum electrody-
namics architecture9,10. This interaction allows the generation of
highly entangled states with concurrence up to 94 per cent.
Although this processor constitutes an important step in quantum
computing with integrated circuits, continuing efforts to increase
qubit coherence times, gate performance and register size will be
required to fulfil the promise of a scalable technology.

These look impressive but are mostly mathematical clickbait. [This stack overflow post describes it well.]( For all practical matters, the largest number ever factored by a quantum computer using Shor's algorithm is still only 35, and that was a year ago.
When I took a Quantum Computing class in University, I remember my professor specifically shits hard on D-Wave, as they peddle their achievements in number of cubits (something like 2000+) in their quantum computer. In reality, their cubits are ""low quality"" and basically useless. Most serious research efforts into Quantum by IBM/Google/Government use 100 cubits on the very high end. For reference, there is a [study done]( that estimates the need for ~20million cubits to beat 2048 bit RSA.";0;k8vzf3;[]

So just for the timeline- I discovered the effect QDs have on the electro-kinetic effects of nematic liquid crystals about 15 years ago, published 10 years ago. Work I did in my undergrad. The QDs can enhance efficiency via an electrophoresis event that results in enhanced kinetics due to the presence of a semiconducting nanoparticle. And then samsung had a commercial product 5 years later using QDs to enhance kinetics and provide back light (my patent).

The article talks about laser cooling, quantum networks, and other ""cool-sounding"" things, but I don't think it describes what he actually did really well. For anyone who's interested, here's a classical (non-quantum) explanation of what happens:
Okay, you may have heard of ""total internal reflection"" Basically, it means that, when hitting the boundary with two substances of differing electric/magnetic susceptibilities, all of the energy of a light wave is reflected internally and no energy is transmitted across the boundary. However, even if no energy is transmitted across the boundary, there is still an evanescent wave, which decreases in amplitude very quickly in space, that is transmitted across.
Basically, they cooled down an atom and used trapping to situate the atom right next to where this reflection would occur. The atom can then interact very strongly with these evanescent waves and block the photon (so that the atom acts as a closed gate). However, by absorbing a single photon, the energy level of the atom changes, so that it is no longer coupled to these evanescent waves. So now the atom acts like an open gate. Basically, you can use a single photon to switch the gate open/closed, like the article says.";0;24rsp4;[]

His theory seemed to be sensible, at least to me. Supposedly this was disproved some time ago, I read the article proving him wrong, the logic to me seemed a bit of a stretch and highly specific to certain attributes of his theory. So those specifics might have been wrong, that doesn't necessarily mean that his reasoning had no merit. Based on everything I have read, going right back to Stanford research on memory performed in the 70's, it seems to me that the brain (not just human) almost has to be a quantum device, there simply isn't enough volume to justify the capabilities in terms of storage and processing.;0;y8t01q;[]

I went to read the paper and began trying to track down the citations that were being used to support their statements and it doesn't look good.
Just in the introduction, we have *Quantum mechanisms are at work in sensory systems feeding the brain with information \[13\]. Foremost in magneto-reception \[4\], there is no doubt that only quantum mechanical effects can explain its sensitivity \[3\].*
Which alone, seems to check out from their source. But the authors try to extend that reasoning with:
*Beyond those sensory inputs, more complex brain functionalities depend on the presence of specific nuclear spins.* Which does not follow. Just because a sensory system utilizes quantum effects, doesn't imply that a system further down the line NECESSARILY uses them as well. I'm sure the birds with quantum-magneto senses also have feet. If I was applying similar logic, I would say that since their feet are connected, they must also have quantum feet. (wheeee) The paper words this in a sneaky way, introducing an irrelevant fact but encouraging the reader to take the presented logical deduction forward.
*For example, Lithium-6 isotopes with nuclear spin 1 increase activity of* *complex behaviour in contrast to Lithium-7 isotopes with 3/2 spin where* *it decreases \[5\]*
The citation mentions a study on rats (which are not human), and indeed uses Li6 and Li7 to observe that Li6 treated mice become helicopter rat moms and Li7 treated mice abandon their children. The mice authors never attribute this effect to nuclear spin. It's also difficult to argue that helicopter parenting is ""increased activity of complex behavior"", which is a word salad to begin with.";0;y8t01q;[]

The ability for these models to run all possible routes of a simulation at once, instead of sequentially, allows it to solve models and equations that beforehand were considered unsolvable.
Case in point, feeding IBMs new quantum computing models a bunch of data about existing minerals so it can run a simulation and give us the most logical solution. [Simulating Atoms](
Second case use is rendering extremely complex models that are a perfect copy of their real world counterparts. Rendering a hydrogen atom is easy. Your school issued chromebook could render each possible state of it and its single proton and electron. Rendering each possible state of an atom like thulium, which has 69 entangled electrons, would take around 20 trillion years for a classical computer.
[Destroying the economy and cybersecurity as a whole](
Third case use is pretty terrifying. Because quantum computers are amazing at breaking down massive data sets, they can be pointed at things like cryptography. For the most part, modern cryptography has been relatively successful at preventing massive attacks and data breaches. However all those attacks were all made by classical computers with nowhere near as much power.
A good majority of modern encryptions simply dont have the ability to withstand a quantum attack. And thats not a fault of the encryption, quantum computers are just that good at going through massive data sets. Encryptions that would be completely impervious to traditional methods get bulldozed by this new technology.

Presumably, he said, there must be some elementary particles - kingons, or possibly queons - that do this job, but of course succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an anti-particle, or republicon.

> There are many caveats to such controversial claims, however. First and foremost, the evidence for entanglement in this experiment is circumstantial, dependent on how one chooses to interpret the light trickling through and out of the cavity-confined bacteria. Marletto and her colleagues acknowledge a classical model free of quantum effects could also account for the experiments results. But, of course, photons are not classical at allthey are quantum. And yet a more realistic semiclassical model using Newtons laws for the bacteria and quantum ones for photons fails to reproduce the actual outcome Coles and his colleagues observed in their laboratory. This hints that quantum effects were at play in both the light and the bacteria. Its a little bit indirect, but I think its because theyre only trying to be so rigorous in ruling out things and claiming anything too much, says James Wootton, a quantum computing researcher at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory who was not involved in either paper.
> The other caveat: the energies of the bacteria and the photon were measured collectively, not independently. This, according to Simon Grblacher of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands who was not part of this research, is somewhat of a limitation. There seems to be something quantum going on, he says. Butusually if we demonstrate entanglement, you have to measure the two systems independently to confirm any quantum correlation between them is genuine.

The difference is that the segmentation comes down to physically separated blobs of matter. The Copenhagen notion of ""observation"" has generated any amount of nonsense. What we know is that a milligram of matter comes ot an equilibrium with itself - a sort of majority vote - in 10^-27 seconds of so. That is what makes it classical. However, the way that it ""voted"" does not effect other similar chunks unless they are entangled with it, which they can be only after it ""votes"", becomes semi-determined. There is a strong argument that such local fixity and entanglement with other lumps of matter constitute the grounds for spacetime. Bacteria are a decided voting quorum, having around 10^11 component atoms, each of which has its constituent particles. They can be expected to exist in a strongly determined state, with very brief periods when the ensemble has to ""vote"" due to an external influence. However, if you go out of your way to isolate one of these, and then act on the photosynthetic centres alone, you can expect it to acquire less determined properties. However, that's not down to 'life' or anything but isolation. Photons are innately quantum entities, and if they interact with absorbent molecules held in isolation, you can expect to see quantum-like phenomena. As you might from a totally inorganic entity - say, a nitrogen atom in a diamond. ";0;9y53lo;[]

The whole universe started from a point infinitely small and exploded for some unknown reason. What the fuck does infinitely small mean? Several billion years later the universe is expanding faster and faster. So now we come up with dark energy to account for that. Maybe gravity is a force that pushes instead of pulling. It exists in the vacuum of space and matter disrupts the force of gravity with anti-gravity, or a weakening of gravity, and that is why the universe is expanding faster the the more empty space it gets.
Perhaps the universes surrounding our universe exert so much gravity that the closer matter gets to those universes the faster it accelerates.

But saying the universe is made from ""fundamental building blocks like pixels"" is ridiculous. What if you take the space one of those pixels entails (lemme guess the plank length) and then you STRETCH that space to one meter? That could happen in our universe. My amateur philosophy is any measurable space contains some trace of energy. The energy and the space are both divisible infinitely. There can be consciousness on a scale infinitely smaller than ours which would consider that one meter you are looking at to actually be infinite. It's called relativity. What appears finite to one observer may appear infinite to another observer. ";0;yjhhu;[]

Quantum computing is based on the idea that a quantum bit isn't just a 1 or 0, like a normal bit. It is a difficult-to-measure probability that the bit is either zero or one. It takes 8 traditional bits of information to represent a single letter of the alphabet, like 10011011. A single quantum bit could have a small chance of being a zero or a small chance of being a one or be closer to 50/50 and everything in between. The more accurately you can measure that probability, the more information you can squeeze into a single bit. And getting more information in less space means that a small computer chip can do a lot more processing than is possible today. The problem with using the probability that something is a 1 or a 0 is that it's difficult to measure. It's tempting to just peek, but as soon as you look, it's either a one or a zero. There's no 50/50 chance anymore. It's just a regular old bit. Booooring. One thing that they can do is peek, but just a little bit. They might flash a light on it for an absurdly short time and say did you see it? I think so but I'm not sure. Aha! That's like a 75% chance! But the longer you peek, the more certain you become. So then they thought, what if we keep flashing a light at it, on off on off. And that works for a little while, because they're not just looking at a stationary target, it's a moving target. And that works for a little while, but eventually you get too much information to pretend you don't know. Imagine watching an invisible person dribble a flourescent basketball in an invisible auditorium with a strobe light. At first you'd see the ball going down. Then hit some kind of bottom. Then it goes up. Then a hand touches it around waist height. Then it goes back down. Oh OK I get it now. At any given point during that dribble you weren't sure if it was going to keep going down or start going back up or what would happen. You could make an educated guess or probability, but until it bounced you wouldn't know where the floor was. But it wouldn't take long to figure out the pattern. And knowing where the ball is isn't very exciting. Remember, the part that makes quantum computers work is knowing the probability, not the actual value So these guys are constantly trying to find ways to trick themselves into not knowing for sure, but knowing enough to get a really good probability. That sounds weird but it's the key to what they're doing. So they said what if I watched that basketball, but instead of using a normal strobe light, I had it pulse randomly. Sometimes the ball is going up, sometimes down, and because it's random, I genuinely don't know where the ball will be next time the light flashes. But if it's too random, then that isn't very useful. I'll get great random predictions but it will take me too much time to unwind the randomness that it will slow down my computing. They need it to be a little random, but also a little predictable. Something that makes it difficult to know where the basketball is with certainty, but also something that computers are good at. For people who don't remember the Fibonacci sequence it is made but continuing to sum the last two numbers. So it starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 because 0 plus 1 is 1, 1 plus 1 is 2, 1 plus 2 is 3, 2 plus 3 is 5, etc. Computers are really good with stuff like that. Simple, repeatable calculations, especially simple addition. So they had the strobe light flash at a weird interval based on the fibonacci sequence and played guesswhere the basketball will be. And what they found was that they could trick themselves a lot longer into not knowing where the basketball would be - a second and a half, which is a really long time in computer terms. They used a really weird basketball (ten atoms of an element you've probably never heard of) and a really weird strobe light, but that's not really important. They took an interesting step in getting better at this. The interesting part is what's next. Is the fibonacci sequence the best choice? It's pretty good at tricking us and quick for computers to figure out. Maybe there's something better. Maybe a different element or different test would help. This was a good step but not the last one.";0;yavq6p;[]

Yes, I agree our brains are also capable of working or thinking in multiple dimensions biologically (deja vu for instance) so we are aware of these other types of dimensions and sometimes our brains have difficulty connecting dots for us to comprehend as well.
The hardest part is building these computers in a way that we can understand or guess the output.

Suppose you're sitting in space and you get a gentle push in one direction that lasts indefinitely. Like, you have a solar sail. You're going to accelerate and accumulate kinetic energy. But if you're in orbit around Earth and you get that same push, it does a whole lot less - sometimes you're moving the same way as the push and it accelerates you, and sometimes it's opposite and it slows you down.
If you want to see how a force is going to impact such an orbiting thing you want to make a 'phase plot', which replaces the time coordinate with where in your orbit you are. If something affects you asymmetrically around this phase plot, it can make progress; if it's symmetric, it's going to cause little deviations but not make much progress.
This phase plot looks a bit like you took the time coordinate and rolled it up into a circle.
So, that worked pretty well. But what's better than one time symmetry operation? Two! Or more than two! But if you're visualizing it as rolling time up in one dimension before, now you have to roll it up in two (or more) dimensions. But it was never rolled up in the first place? So whatever, that's a visualization problem, not a physics problem.
Now it may be possible to *model* this as a system with two time dimensions. But that doesn't mean we've unlocked a second time dimension, just like even though one can make a good model of a carbon nanotube's electron sea that involves only one spatial dimension, that doesn't mean the world is purely stuck on a straight line. It's an effective model for a special system that's implemented in normal matter using normal time and space, and the model has requirements and limits.";0;yavq6p;[]

**This experiments goal was to try to make qubits more stable.**
Qubits are quantum bits, or units of information storage with properties seen in quantum physics particles. In the same way a digital computer stores information in binary bits of 1s and 0s, a quantum computer tries to hold information in inherently unstable qubits 1/0s and 0/1s. We want this feature from qubits because it allows for, in theory, computationally work-heavy tasks to be done much faster, as qubits allow for an extra superposition for calculations to take place, mathematically.
The problem is that qubits lose this extra superposition quality the more we use them. This is because their superpositions degrade or decohere into non-superposition each time we measure their information state as a 1, 0, 1/0, or 0/1. When that happens, we no longer can use the quantum computers special features.
This research team sought to fix this problem by providing a non-repeating structure to elongate the amount of time a qubit can stay in superposition. Whats special is that they used a mathematical structure to mimic a quasi-crystal (a crystal with a stable, non-repeating pattern) in time. By doing this, the superpositions of the qubits could be read without collapsing for longer. **This means the experiment found a potential way for qubits to remain super for longer by giving them a non-repeating pattern to help them stay super, which could help us build more efficient quantum computers.**
Hope that helps! (Physicists dont be too mad at me lol)";0;ysg8ft;[]

The most famous proponent of quantum coherence in living systems is of course Roger Penrose, who predicted that microtubules in neurons can sustain coherence for relatively sizable times. This ties into Penrose's ideas about consciousness requiring a quantum mechanical component to work. He also thinks quantum mechanics is incomplete.
Entanglement is not quite the same thing as coherence, but it's a similar enough phenomenon to make me wonder if this is going to renew interest in Penrose's hypothesis. Of course, I'm aware that many Redditors strongly dislike Penrose's ideas. Personally, I'm sitting on the fence. Penrose is a world-famous mathematical genius and theoretical physicist. He's also something of a contrarian and he's pretty old. Also, don't forget that it's possible to be wrong about one topic but right about another. Not all of Penrose's guesses are equal- some are probably completely mistaken, but his other ideas may turn out to be extremely fruitful. Edit: And BTW, I'm not Wikipedia and I didn't use W to write this comment. If you find something I got wrong because I relied on my faulty memory- that's OK. You should feel free to correct me, but please don't heckle me with pedantic comments.
Edit2: The title of the paper is >Sustained Quantum Coherence and Entanglement in the Avian Compass
So, it is a coherence phenomenon as well. I will see if it's available on arxiv. [Arxiv free version](";0;facw0;[]

Quantum computer is a type of an ""analog computer"". I.e.
1) There is a distinct physical process
2) There is a distinct heavy computation of interest that directly resembles the physical process in question
3) Instead of doing #2, we let #1 happen and check out results
This kind of thing existed years ago. What is new today is the specific physical processes that are being harnessed are from the quantum world.
That is it.
Note that:
1) It is not a generic computing device and it will never become one
2) Speed up in ""calculations"" is inherently tied to physical process being described by the same equations one is trying to solve
3) And a bummer is that the calculation result might or might not be correct. Probability of it being correct might be increased by adding more steps.";0;wnqygj;[]

This paper was rumored for a while, and a [leaked version briefly made its way online.](
Edit: There have been a lot of great questions in the comments. Let me try to answer some of them in bulk paraphrase. (For some of the more technical questions, I'm in touch with our physics reporter, Emily Conover, but she's got her hands full today.)
Q: Will this affect my internet/gaming/etc. experience?
A: Not for a very long time, barring some huge, unforeseen breakthrough.
Q: But didn't IBM call BS on this?
A: Pretty much, yes. We address that in the article. IBM claims a classical supercomputer can do this in 2.5 days, not the 10,000 years Google claims, but IBM also hasn't done this calculation. And even so, the gap between 2.5 days with the world's most powerful supercomputer and 200 seconds with an experimental quantum computer is pretty big.
Q: If this isn't practically applicable, why is it important?
A: A lot of things start off as generally not relevant to consumers. Until one day, they suddenly are VERY relevant. Also, science is a process, and this is a big milestone, even if you take IBM's side in this debate.
Q: ELI5?
A: Oh crap, I'm not a quantum physicist. I'll defer to this article Emily wrote in 2017 which [explains the coming rise in quantum computing]( (edit: This article would normally be behind a paywall, but I lifted it for y'all!). It's not a short article, but you kinda can't do this subject justice in short form. But to make a very long, very complicated story very short and oversimplified, quantum computers rely on 'qubits' where classical computers (including the kind you use on a daily basis, and supercomputers that you probably don't use) rely on bits. Bits can be either 0 or 1. Qubits can be either 0, 1 or a superposition of both. Using those qubits in very complicated ways (again, I am not a physicist), quantum computers have the potential to solve problems that classical computers can't ever achieve, or can't achieve without thousands of years of effort. It's still very far down the road, but the implications are potentially enormous.
Edit 2: Q: But crypto??
A: This computer did *one very specific thing* that takes classical computers a long time to do. This doesn't automatically invalidate standard encryption or blockchain practices. Now, is that a thing that might happen eventually with more powerful quantum computers of the future? Time will tell.";0;dlwaxv;[]

While nice. It isn't very surprising. For example. I can claim I made a device that calculates the minimal surface area containing a given volume. And it does so faster than any computer does.
Without context maybe that sounds interesting. But in reality all I did was blow bubbles onto volumes. (They minimize surface area).

In the paper, it is argued that their device reached quantum supremacy and that a state-of-the-art supercomputer would require approximately 10,000 years to perform the equivalent task. *We argue that an ideal simulation of the same task can be performed on a classical system in 2.5 days and with far greater fidelity*. This is in fact a conservative, worst-case estimate, and we expect that with additional refinements the classical cost of the simulation can be further reduced.

In the preprint, it is argued that their device reached quantum supremacy and that a state-of-the-art supercomputer would require approximately 10,000 years to perform the equivalent task.We argue that an ideal simulation of the same task can be performed on a classical system in 2.5 days and with far greater fidelity. This is in fact a conservative, worst-case estimate, and we expect that with additional refinements the classical cost of the simulation can be further reduced.
Because the original meaning of the term quantum supremacy, as proposed by John Preskill in 2012, was to describe the point where quantum computers can do things that classical computers cant, this threshold has not been met.

That's not a computation anyone cares about though and is naturally very in favour of the quantum computer. They do say.
> However, realizing the full promise of quantum computing (using Shors algorithm for factoring, for example) still requires technical leaps to engineer fault-tolerant logical qubits
So it's a nice achievement, but a useful quantum computer is still some leaps away.

Which isn't surprising, since D-Wave have been so rubbish at communicating in anything but hyperbole...shooting themselves in the foot even though they seem to have actually achieved something impressive!
D-Wave have been going on about this sort of thing for quite a while, but there was heavy scepticism because they basically seemed to be claiming to have solved all (massive) outstanding problems in quantum computing, but wouldn't really tell anyone how or do proper demonstrations.
It now seems to be emerging that *can* make machines that *probably* do use quantum effects to solve a *particular class* of problems. That's great, and the class of problems includes many useful real life ones. But it probably *isn't* a quantum computer in the sense that everyone else in the field ever uses the term - that is, it's not a general calculation device using qubits. That isn't necessarily a problem, it may be able to solve problems in its class faster than a classical computer and even algorithmically faster than is classically possible. But it doesn't mean it's a general purpose machine that could possibly replace (say) your CPU right now. They and many others are probably working towards the more general case, and they've probably made important breakthroughs on the way, but it doesn't sound like they're actually there yet.
Since they really do seem to be producing useful machines and have recently produced some more convincing evidence of quantum effects, it will be very interesting to see where this leads, but be very wary of taking these kinds of articles at face value.

> Its a big win for D-Wave, said Rose, who has battled skeptics who questioned the legitimacy of his quantum technology a technology he noted no other company is working on today.
This kind of thing is vaguely annoying - the initial scepticism was heavily justified, and shouldn't be whitewashed away by them eventually properly proving a level of success. Also, I'd be willing to bet that *many* companies (and governments...) are working on this kind of technology, though the field focuses on the more general quantum computer concept. Perhaps nobody is publicly working on exactly the same sort of machine...

Researchers are making a counter-intuitive claim: reality itself may be subjective, thanks to quantum weirdness on a microscopic scale.
In a new paper in the journal Science Advances, an international team of quantum physicists argue that thanks to the unusual rules of quantum mechanics, facts themselves could depend on who's looking at them.
On a quantum level, it's long been understood that particles can be in several states at once.
In an experimental test at the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, the researchers built a small-scale quantum computer.
Their aim was to scientifically prove that measurements in quantum mechanics are actually subjective to a particular observer.
""Eventually, we succeeded in showing that quantum mechanics might indeed be incompatible with the assumption of objective facts - we violated the inequality!"" lead researchers Alessandro Fedrizzi and Massimiliano Proietti, quantum physicists at Heriot-Watt University, wrote in a recent piece for The Conversation.
""The insight we gained is that quantum observers may indeed be entitled to their own facts,"" wrote Fedrizzi in a September statement.";0;dwz9ks;[]

Then, not long ago, I saw an interview with a Chinese scientist (the Chinese are killing it in quantum computing and AI) claiming they're going to use the technology to solve how human consciousness works. The theory is our brains work like one when making choices. Yes, no, and superposition (both at the same time). How we arrive at a choice depends on the journey our mind takes to solve it which can take different routes even if the circumstances are identical each time.

> However, the lack of objectivity revealed by a Bell-Wigner test does not arise in anyones consciousness, but between the recorded facts. Because quantum theory does not distinguish between information recorded in a microscopic system (such as our photonic memory) and in a macroscopic system, the conclusions are the same for both.
They say that:
> the violation of inequality implies that at least one of the three assumptions of free choice, locality, and observer-independent facts must fail. [..] A compelling way to accommodate our result is then to proclaim that facts of the world can only be established by a privileged observere.g., one that would have access to the global wavefunction in the many worlds interpretation or Bohmian mechanics. Another option is to give up observer independence completely by considering facts only relative to observers, or by adopting an interpretation such as QBism, where quantum mechanics is just a tool that captures an agents subjective prediction of future measurement outcomes.
All of this depends on the validity of current quantum mechanical descriptions:
> An observer W observes another observer F who performs a quantum measurement on a physical system. The two observers then formulate a statement about the physical system's state after the measurement according to the laws of quantum theory. However, in most of the interpretations of quantum theory, the resulting statements of the two observers contradict each other. That is, ""most of the interpretations of quantum theory"" give the wrong answer when applied to this situation. [see here]( These theories play out in the conventioanl 4D space time in which we are embedded.

Right off the bat they treat a macroscopic object (a photodetector) as if it were a quantum object (in superposition and entangled to other quantum objects). That's not how any of this works. In order to make the photodetector a quantum object, they would need to successfully causally isolate it on a completely unprecedented scale (the photodetector would amount to constructing a quantum system of as many atoms as make up the detector, while we currently struggle to get systems of even a few tens of atoms to be isolated) - they mentioned no argument as to why their photodetector might be isolated enough to consider as a quantum system and instead just blindly perform the thought experiment as described in plain language. I'm not certain why they get the answer they do yet - I would need to take a closer look at the possible biases in the experimental methods - but their treatment of the photodetector is so wrong that I'm certain it's either a fabricated result or else there's an experimental flaw giving the biased answer. (Am on my phone rn, so can't dig into the rest of their methods rn).
We all live in the macro world. The probabilistic outcomes of the quantum world average themselves out via collapse and entanglement on our scales, so that we will agree on facts about the world on macro (and even quantum scales once we measure them) unless someone succeeds at isolating systems as large as people - something that probably isn't possible for millenia at least, if at all. This kind of psuedo-quantum factual-relativism is bunk.
Edit: thinking a bit about it, I'm pretty sure the result they do get is just a typical nonlocality result with extra mess from the weird assumption about the photodetectors being isolated. In which case, this definitely doesn't mean anything about reality being subjective and is a typical result which shows their initial photon source was in fact producing entangled photon pairs (which isn't a surprise).
Edit 2: in fact, nonlocality and entanglement can be thought of as a way to enforce consistency between isolated observers when they check answers with each other. If an observer isolated from me measures a spin, that observer becomes entangled - from my perspective - with the spin state (think about the case where they write down their result as a spin). If I then measure the spin, I can tell you what the other observer measured because I know they're entangled with it/ observed an outcome. Likewise if I ask them what they measured, I also know the spin state, again, because it's entangled with them. Entanglement ensures consistency rather than cause subjectivity or inconsistency.";0;dwz9ks;[]

To sum up the ""real karma"" idea: when you see the car you just bought all over the road, it's not because there are more of them on the road, it's because it's become important to you. When you see faces on the street, you remember the ones you know because they're important to you. This is a holdover from our caveman days. ""We need berries"" turned in to finding berries by a trick of the brain.
This translates in our current waking life to seeing what we value, and here is where the karma part comes in. When what we value is goodness and kindness, we can look at the same coffee shop scene and pick out and identify the kind gestures, and the positive elements of the scene. When we value competition, or self worth, we tend to judge based on comparison, and tend to see the negativity in the scene.
To me, this is a very real world example of an idea called karma. Where the lover values the time they had with someone who has passed, the selfish person sinks into sadness for what they lost. The mindsets, with this research, tend to make me think that my pragmatic approach to karma might be a bit too mechanical, and that there might be an actuality to the mindset we carry.";0;dxnw0v;[]

> Knig and his colleagues have now conclusively demonstrated the advantage of quantum computers. To this end, they developed a quantum circuit that can solve a specific difficult algebraic problem. The new circuit has a simple structure: it only performs a fixed number of operations on each qubit. Such a circuit is referred to as having a constant depth. In their work, the researchers prove that the problem at hand cannot be solved using classical constant-depth circuits.
This tells you virtually nothing. You can carry out fats, approximate calculations using a nomogram or two elastic bands which require a digital computer to use a linear program or similar. However, one of these has a link to a AAAS Scince article [here](
> We show that parallel quantum algorithms running in a constant time period are strictly more powerful than their classical counterparts; they are provably better at solving certain linear algebra problems associated with binary quadratic forms. Our work gives an unconditional proof of a computational quantum advantage and simultaneously pinpoints its origin: It is a consequence of quantum nonlocality.

That's not a computation anyone cares about though and is naturally very in favour of the quantum computer. They do say.
> However, realizing the full promise of quantum computing (using Shors algorithm for factoring, for example) still requires technical leaps to engineer fault-tolerant logical qubits
So it's a nice achievement, but a useful quantum computer is still some leaps away.
Their mention of a RAM limitation on the classical supercomputer is also a bit odd. There are existing techniques to deal with that, such as using hard drive caches or running in compressed memory space.";0;dly2n8;[]

Quantum computers could vastly outperform conventional machines on certain tasks. The goal is to achieve what has come to be known as"" quantum supremacy""where a quantumcomputercan outperform conventional computers on at least one type of task. Until now, only one computer has ever achieved this featGoogle's Sycamore device. And because the field is still so new, researchers around the world are working on vastly different designs. Sycamore was based on qubits represented by superconducting materials. In this new effort, the team in China has developed aphoton-based quantum computer capable of carrying out a single specific type of calculationboson sampling.
I can't even grasp the full significance of what quantum supremacy computing entails, but it really sounds like something out of the 22nd century.

First off, the device they have can only be used to perform this one task. As such, I don't think it fits the definition of a ""computer"" because it lacks the ability to be programmed. What seems to be a minor nitpick is, in practice, a very important point.
Second, this device uses optics, which is the simplest way to build wrt physics. Given enough precision, it can be built in a lab using standard equipment; the caveat being the precision. And this is also what makes this remarkable, what they built around to achieve needed precision. How well it scales for more complex problems remains to be seen.
Third, those machines always target simple quantum problems. Those problems are hard for classic computers, sure, but easy for quantum simulators (avoiding the word computer here). It is a great feat, but more fitting would be to say that this is an experiment that proves a thesis or finds a constant.
But the original authors are at least open about that, something you don't always see in the quantum sphere, especially when it comes to news:
> Building a fault-tolerant quantum computer to run Shors algorithm, however, still requires long-term efforts.
Fault-tolerant quantum computing for more complex algorithms and not just simulation of quantum problems is still far off. Shor's algorithm is a whole different beast regarding quantum computing requirements. But that's not what's selling news. Instead you have people talking about Bitcoin suddenly being insecure (which honestly would be among the least of our problems).";0;k8cxw7;[]

Thats what is going on here, but instead of a pendulum they have an array of lasers, mirrors, and beam splitters that simulates a very particular class of problem that involves sampling a complicated probability density function.

1. This device is not programmable.
2. This device, or more specifically, the Boson sampling method itself, is not universal, meaning it cannot do universal computation, **unlike the Google one last year**. Think of universal computers like your laptop, while non-universal computers like a pocket calculator: it is only able to solve certain specific problems.
3. This experiment is not very scalable.

I think at this point we really need to start considering their perspective

The reason quantum computers are so great at what they do - and yet are still not used in industry - is because with our current technology, they are actually really bad at most things. For example there is no quantum computer in the world that can run a video game.
This quantum computer in question is solving a probability question via sampling. Meaning instead of using formulas to make predictions, the are running some sort of simulation many many times to generate a sampling, and output the value generated from that.
>\[In a traditional system\] The fastest known exact classical algorithm for the standard Boson Sampling problem takes O(((m+n1)/n)n2^(n)) time to produce samples for a system with input size n and m output modes
That big formula is the come complexity, i.e. ""when the input gets bigger, how much longer will the algorithm take? Some systems get relatively faster or slower as input grows. Note the 2^(n), as \`n\` grows, that element sky rockets. That is why a normal computer would take so long.
They don't have the algorithm published, however it is clear based on the time discrepancy that the quantum computers are able to perform the calculation with a different time complexity, removing the \`2^(n)\` portion.";0;k8cxw7;[]

For example, each of the crystals could be generating, say, 1,000 pairs of photons per second. With constructive interference, the detectors would register 4,000 pairs of photons per second. And with destructive interference, they would detect none: the system as a whole would not create any photons even though individual crystals would be generating 1,000 pairs a second.

>During their early attempts to simplify and generalize what MELVIN had found, Krenn and his colleagues realized that the solution resembled abstract mathematical forms called graphs, which contain vertices and edges and are used to depict pairwise relations between objects. For these quantum experiments, every path a photon takes is represented by a vertex. And a crystal, for example, is represented by an edge connecting two vertices. MELVIN first produced such a graph and then performed a mathematical operation on it. The operation, called perfect matching, involves generating an equivalent graph in which each vertex is connected to only one edge. This process makes calculating the final quantum state much easier, although it is still hard for humans to understand. > >That changed with MELVINs successor THESEUS, which generates much simpler graphs by winnowing the first complex graph representing a solution that it finds down to the bare minimum number of edges and vertices (such that any further deletion destroys the setups ability to generate the desired quantum states). Such graphs are simpler than MELVINs perfect matching graphs, so it is even easier to make sense of any AI-generated solution.";0;of897k;[]

No they aren't. Ones that will go at high speed and be proof against people in possession of the device from interfering with it are expensive. Ones that will give you a stream appropriate for use in a cell phone (i.e., tens of bits per second) are pennies. You don't need megabits of key material to secure an email.
Typical science reporting.
The actual interesting breakthrough is the realization that you have 8 million quantum processors in parallel. That's kind of clever. All the hype about how they've finally solved the world's shortage of random numbers is just hype.

1. Quantum Computers need a Superconductor to work, and not just any Superconductor, but one locked into a finite state and stabilized.
2. Currently to do this we have to basically cool the material down to very very very close to absolute zero. **If we ever figure out a way to achieve this at more reasonable temperatures, Quantum Computers aren't the only thing this tech applies to.** Most of human life as we know it would fundamentally change if we can figure out a way to lock in super conductors at reasonable temps (and this isnt just being a super conductor, its a **stable** super conductor)
3. This process takes **several days** to perform, for *one* calculation. You heard me. And 99% of that time is that whole ""cooling it down to almost absolute zero"" part I mentioned above, as well as trial and error. See what happens is they cool it down annnd... nope it failed, try again. Repeat several times til it locks in right. Even if you get it on the first try, it will take easily 1-2 days for *one* calc. And there's not much we can do to speed it up because its literally just sitting around waiting for it to get cold.
4. And to **keep** it that cold so it works, the thing needs to sit in a giant room with multiple layers of protection, cooling, heat sinks, you name it. A single Quantum Computer unit takes up an entire room, and it needs to be a Clean Room, everyone in suits.
5. And by the way, the cost to have a couple engineers run the thing, all the cooling liquid, the mountains of electricity, the equipment... Each calculation costs a small fortune to simply just run it.
6. Modern encryption algorithms would require a QPU several billion times more powerful than what we have right now. And if we just bump up the tier of encryption people use on basic stuff one tick, just a ever so slight bump of the knob up, it becomes several billion *times* more of a requirement yet again. You go from needing a couple billion qubits to a couple billion *billion* qubits, with just a nudge of encryption tier up, just like that.
So for perspective now:
Imagine if it took several days and fifty thousand dollars to hack **one** encrypted item, like, **one** email, *and* that email has to use an *extremely* outdated form of encryption from like, 20+ years ago. And we have millions and millions of qubits to work with (as opposed to the, what are we at, like 200 now on the most advanced QPU? Did we hit 400 yet?)
Then I mean yep, you can do that, sure hope that email was worth the 50K it cost to crack.
And I mean, hey, if its like, super critical information conferred between some politician and someone else 20 years ago that matters now... Maybe it could be.
But no one is gonna drop 50K on cracking your portable hard drive full of ~~porn~~ ""family photos""";0;ojr4kr;[]

Take the experiment, model it as a quantum circuit, encode that circuit into CCNOT + H, and now you have a real-number-only model of the situation. (Not that you'd want to use instead of the much more elegant original circuit that used operations whose matrices contained imaginary numbers.) I assume the paper is sneaking in some unstated assumption, that disallows something about the encoding step, in order to make the result go through.
On further reading, they actually do mention this in the paper:
> Our results rely on the assumption that the independence of two or more quantum systems is captured by the tensor product structure. If we drop this assumption, there exist real frameworks alternative to quantum theory that have the same predictive power, such as Bohmian mechanics [32] or real quantum physics with a universal qubit [33].
In other words, the complex-to-real encoding must have the property that you can independently encode the parts of the system, and then put them together in the usual way (tensor products), and get the same result as if you'd encoded the entire system. I think the reason this is such a problem is that going from complex numbers to real numbers involves adding a degree of freedom to separate complex numbers into one real number for the real part and one real number for the imaginary part. But if you encode each part separately you end up creating this real vs imaginary distinction multiple times instead of one time, which creates a mess.";0;rh3nji;[]

>Abstract
>>Although complex numbers are essential in mathematics, they are not needed to describe physical experiments, as those areexpressed in terms of probabilities, hence real numbers. Physics, however, aims to explain, rather than describe, experiments through theories. Although most theories of physics are based on real numbers, quantum theory was the first to be formulated in terms of operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces. This has puzzled countless physicists, including the fathers of the theory, for whom a real version of quantum theory, in terms of real operators, seemed much more natural. In fact, previous studies have shown that such areal quantum theory can reproduce the outcomes of any multipartite experiment, as long as the parts share arbitrary real quantum states. Herewe investigate whether complex numbers are actually needed in the quantum formalism. We show this to be case by proving that real and complex Hilbert-space formulations of quantum theory make different predictions in network scenarios comprising independent states and measurements. This allows us to devise a Bell-like experiment, the successful realization of which would disprove real quantum theory, in the same way as standard Bell experiments disproved local physics.

[Ruling out real-valued standard formalism of quantum theory](
>ABSTRACT
Standard quantum theory was formulated with complex-valued Schrdinger equations, wave functions, operators, and Hilbert spaces. Previous work attempted to simulate quantum systems using only real numbers by exploiting an enlarged Hilbert space. A fundamental question arises: are the complex numbers really necessary in the standard formalism of quantum theory? To answer this question, a quantum game has been developed to distinguish standard quantum theory from its real-number analogue, by revealing a contradiction between a high-fidelity multi-qubit quantum experiment and players using only real-number quantum theory. Here, using superconducting qubits, we faithfully realize the quantum game based on deterministic entanglement swapping with a state-of-the-art fidelity of 0.952. Our experimental results violate the real-number bound of 7.66 by 43 standard deviations. Our results disprove the real-number formulation and establish the indispensable role of complex numbers in the standard quantum theory.

[Operational Resource Theory of Imaginarity](
>>Wave-particle duality is one of the basic features of quantum mechanics, giving rise to the use of complex numbers in describing states of quantum systems and their dynamics and interaction. Since the inception of quantum theory, it has been debated whether complex numbers are essential or whether an alternative consistent formulation is possible using real numbers only. Here, we attack this long-standing problem theoretically and experimentally, using the powerful tools of quantum resource theories. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, quantum states are easier to create and manipulate if they only have real elements. This gives an operational meaning to the resource theory of imaginarity. We identify and answer several important questions, which include the state-conversion problem for all qubit states and all pure states of any dimension and the approximate imaginarity distillation for all quantum states. As an application, we show that imaginarity plays a crucial role in state discrimination, that is, there exist real quantum states that can be perfectly distinguished via local operations and classical communication but that cannot be distinguished with any nonzero probability if one of the parties has no access to imaginarity. We confirm this phenomenon experimentally with linear optics, discriminating different two-photon quantum states by local projective measurements. Our results prove that complex numbers are an indispensable part of quantum mechanics.";0;rhooth;[]

Let me quote from Lumo's blog
*In classical physics, complex numbers would be used as bookkeeping devices to remember the two coordinates of a two-dimensional vector; the complex numbers also knew something about the length of two-dimensional vectors. But this usage of the complex numbers was not really fundamental. In particular, the multiplication of two complex numbers never directly entered physics.*
*This totally changed when quantum mechanics was born. The waves in quantum mechanics had to be complex, ""exp(ikx)"", for the waves to remember the momentum as well as the direction of motion. And when you multiply operators or state vectors, you actually have to multiply complex numbers (the matrix elements) according to the rules of complex multiplication.*
*Now, we need to emphasize that it doesn't matter whether you write the number as ""exp(ikx)"", ""cos(kx)+i.sin(kx)"", ""cos(kx)+j.sin(kx)"", or ""(cos kx, sin kx)"" with an extra structure defining the product of two 2-component vectors. It doesn't matter whether you call the complex numbers ""complex numbers"", ""Bambelli's spaghetti"", ""Euler's toilets"", or ""Feynman's silly arrows"". All these things are mathematically equivalent. What matters is that they have two inseparable components and a specific rule how to multiply them.*
*The commutator of ""x"" and ""p"" equals ""xp-px"" which is, for two Hermitean (real-eigenvalue-boasting) operators, an anti-Hermitean operator i.e. ""i"" times a Hermitean operator (because its Hermitean conjugate is ""px-xp"", the opposite thing). You can't do anything about it: if it is a c-number, it has to be a pure imaginary c-number that we call ""i.hbar"". The uncertainty principle forces the complex numbers upon us.*
*So the imaginary unit is not a ""trick"" that randomly appeared in one application of some bizarre quantum mechanics problem - and something that you may humiliate. The imaginary unit is guaranteed to occur in any system that reduces to classical physics in a limit but is not a case of classical physics exactly.*
*Completely universally, the commutator of Hermitean operators - that are ""deduced"" from real classical observables - have commutators that involve an ""i"". That means that their definitions in any representation that you may find have to include some ""i"" factors as well. Once ""i"" enters some fundamental formulae of physics, including Schrdinger's (or Heisenberg's) equation, it's clear that it penetrates to pretty much all of physics. In particular: In quantum mechanics, probabilities are the only thing we can compute about the outcomes of any experiments or phenomena. And the last steps of such calculations always include the squaring of absolute values of complex probability amplitudes. Complex numbers are fundamental for all predictions in modern science.*
People who claim that quantum physics is equivalent to engineering problems IMHO fundamentally misunderstand both engineering mathematics and quantum physics.";0;rhooth;[]

In the currently accepted expansion model of our universe, a point in ""real-time"" at which there is a singularity is required, which can be a difficult thing to deal with when attempting to discern a ""beginning"" because the laws of physics break down at one. However, to put it simply, imaginary time allows us to avoid this conundrum by visualizing time as just another direction in space, ergo euclidian spacetime, wherein the singularity we saw prior is just another point in 4D spacetime.
The example used in ""A Brief History of Time"" to visualize this is to imagine a sphere with North and South poles, not unlike the earth, with lines of latitude radiating evenly outwards. In this, the North represents the earliest point in imaginary time, and the South the latest, and the size of the latitude lines (which get progressively bigger as you reach the equator of this sphere) represent the size of the universe with respect to this imaginary time. Moving from North to South, we start at a single point (the North Pole) meant to represent a singularity prior to the Big Bang, but instead of our real-time notion of a singularity, in imaginary time, it's just another point. The same thing applies for the South Pole of this model, meant to represent the ""Big Crunch"".

Whether the math proves it to be true is irrelevant, the math itself is indeed imaginary as well. Our entire understanding of the way the universe works are based on observations that we have been entirely contaminating by even observing their existence. Since it's impossible to actually know the exact location and trajectory of a particle until we measure it there is no factual way of determing if that particle simply stopped to be observed or if that was its intended measurements before observation occurs. How can we be sure that we ourselves are not acting as particles to the 4th dimensional observer? These subatomic materials clearly have enough sentience ro be aware of their observation and act according to our presence because there holds a direct correlation between our imaginary numbers and these particles. There's no mistake that these particles are giving us the information and feeding it to us through some unseen link between the immaterial and the material. The very existence of dark matter suggests an invisible force guiding all things through the observable universe. It's my theory that not only does the God particle exist but it is a product of the interaction when dark matter and matter are able to meet at the exact same frequency. Since dark matter is immensely difficult to produce and there is only a finite amount it is near impossible to get accurate findings that can be called conclusive and until we have reached a higher level civilization that progress will only be at a crawl pace. Modern scientists have recently discovered 11 new packets of dimensions that are all geometrically different in their measurements and this was through the observations they've made on dark matter, the quantized world around us, and even space itself. We are moving beyond the world of science fiction and into the field of general accepted theory friends. Our world, our universe grows bigger and bigger each second and with our observations those growths get larger and larger. This universe is alive, and aware of us, just as we are alive and aware of the quantum world inside of us.;0;rh3nji;[]

Abstract
> Majorana zero-modesa type of localized quasiparticlehold great promise for topological quantum computing1. Tunnelling spectroscopy in electrical transport is the primary tool for identifying the presence of Majorana zero-modes, for instance as a zero-bias peak in differential conductance2. The height of the Majorana zero-bias peak is predicted to be quantized at the universal conductance value of 2e2/h at zero temperature3 (where e is the charge of an electron and h is the Planck constant), as a direct consequence of the famous Majorana symmetry in which a particle is its own antiparticle. The Majorana symmetry protects the quantization against disorder, interactions and variations in the tunnel coupling3,4,5. Previous experiments6, however, have mostly shown zero-bias peaks much smaller than 2e2/h, with a recent observation7 of a peak height close to 2e2/h. Here we report a quantized conductance plateau at 2e2/h in the zero-bias conductance measured in indium antimonide semiconductor nanowires covered with an aluminium superconducting shell. The height of our zero-bias peak remains constant despite changing parameters such as the magnetic field and tunnel coupling, indicating that it is a quantized conductance plateau. We distinguish this quantized Majorana peak from possible non-Majorana origins by investigating its robustness to electric and magnetic fields as well as its temperature dependence. The observation of a quantized conductance plateau strongly supports the existence of Majorana zero-modes in the system, consequently paving the way for future braiding experiments that could lead to topological quantum computing.";0;88i4vl;[]

The basics that I got from it is right now, computers try every combination of possibilities one by one when they are calculating something, whereas quantum computers can try exponentially more outcomes at once, and do it simultaneously. So, if I have this right, a logic gate is asked ""what is 4+4""? A computer tries 0, then 1, then 2, etc all the way to 8, getting the answer ""no"" until it gets to 8. With a quantum computer, it tests every possibility from 1 to 2^^^y simultaneously, where y is the number of qubits you have, i.e. 3 qubits allows you to test 1 through 8 all at once.

I work with Majorana fermions (theoretically). To put this into context:
[This research]( provides very high quality experimental evidence for the existence of Majorana bound states.
Majorana bound states arise in certain superconductors. Superconductivity is an inherently quantum mechanical phenomenon, where electrons form pairs, which then do weird quantum stuff. So, if you want to build a quantum computer, superconductors are a good place to look.
Describing majorana bound states as a ""half-electron"" is a bit, well, not quite misleading, but not a good idea either. For instance, they have no electric charge. A more accurate description would be: A majorana bound state is to an electron what the real and imaginary part are to a complex number.
The fact that Majorana bound states could be useful for quantum computation was first pointed out by [A. Kitaev in 2000][1]. This was a fairly theoretical idea until, in 2010, there were [two][2] [suggestions][3] that Majorana fermions should be present in certain systems that we can actually realize in the laboratory. Early reports, [like in 2012][4], claimed to have done this, but the evidence was not that good. Now it's 2018, and we're finally seeing high quality experiments that work as the theory suggested about a decade ago. So, yes, the progress is great, but it's been a long road almost 20 years in the making.
I've heard the story that some time after hearing about Majorana bound states, [Michael Freedman][5] approached Bill Gates and asked whether he would fund this approach to building a quantum computer. Today, Microsoft is indeed paying top dollar to pursue this. My guess is that it will still take > 10 years to actually build a quantum computer. [1]: [2]: [3]: [4]: [5]: ";0;88i5eq;[]

Beware, highly technical. He starts with the Hamiltonian of a classical system with broken time symmetry. This is shown to have internal mathematical problems. He asserts: *The connection between breakdown of the equation of motion and breaking of time translation symmetry (i.e., motion in the ground state) is general:*. In essence, the minimum energy state of the system has non-zero motion. He shows that there are two ways out of this.
The next step is to look at a quantised system, noting that - given the above - a *system with spontaneous time translation-symmetry breaking appears perilously close to being a perpetual motion machine.* However, *We can capture an important part of the essence of the matter by considering a very simple quantum mechanical model, to wit a charged particle on a ring threaded by magnetic flux.* Mathematics shows that the ground state (minimum energy) of this particle has it circling the ring, because its minimum energy state implies motion. The system must have infinite degrees of freedom, as finite systems cannot show symmetry breaking. So:
*We take an infinite number of copies of our ring-particles, with an identical attractive interaction between each pair. The particles will want to be in the same place* (because they are mutually attractive), and for reasons given above re minimum energy state, they will want to move. *So we can expect to get a moving lump. Such a dynamical configuration will violate time translation symmetry, giving us a time crystal.* Dah daa, followed by a lot of algebra to establish the regularity - repetition - of this within a quantum system.

Another tidbit about entanglement that is tricky comes up when thinking about what happens when observing one particle that is entangled with another.

But it also means that the effect could be far more useful. The extra information that can be transferred could power technologies such as a possible quantum internet, allowing for instant and very secure communication. >The higher the dimensions of your quantum system, the more secure you can ensure your communication is and the more information you can encode, Ciarn Lee, from University College London, told New Scientist.

> Read the article asshat
Kudos for not putting up a paywall article. So I decided to give it a read. Few choice quotes:
> The rise of quantum computing may...
The word ""may"" is a qualifier to keep people from commiting when they are on shaky ground. From a statistical standpoint, a room full of typewriters and chimpanzees MAY produce the complete works of Shakespeare, it is just damned unlikely.
> Public key cryptography based on the RSA standard has been in use since the late 1970s. Each user has a public key for purposes of identification, and a private key
Bitcoin doesn't use RSA. It uses ECDSA which is different on very fundamental levels.
> The public key is based on two very large prime numbers, which are secret; only the recipient knows the prime numbers, which are required to decrypt the message. Factoring extremely large numbers into primes, decrypting the private key requires factoring extremely large numbers into primes, something that takes supercomputers a very long time to do.
Bitcoin obscures public keys behind quantum-proof SHA256 / RIPEMD160. Only those who perform address reuse (spending) would even be applicable to the theories laid out in this article.

Guy clearly doesn't know that bitcoin addresses are hashes-of-keys, not keys

WTF?!?... Taproot has nothing to do with linkages to FIAT banking.

Actually though, might we someday be able to send messages one at a time through a black hole to another universe, and receive messages as well from... wait ... what does the entry point INTO our universe from another universe look like? That is, what is the physical inverse of a black hole?
Also, does quantum connectivity of separate pairs persist into or through a black hole? I imagine it breaks at the event horizon.
Why doesn't a black hole keep growing by sucking up virtual particles from the vacuum sea over the eons? (Instead of evaporating through Hawking radiation?)
NS article notes ""In this new model, the gravitational field still increases as you near the black hole's core.""
To me that implies that black holes have increasing density as you approach the 'core'. But if the core were immensely high density, how could it be a gateway out of this universe? So maybe at its center there might be such a thing but you would have to pass through the dense core's outer layer to get there. So in effect it might be barricaded.";0;1f9ha2;[]

>[Technical procedural stuff.] New observables living in the bulk appear at the quantum level (analogous to spin in quantum mechanics) that are not present at the classical level and are associated with the discrete nature of the spin network states of loop quantum gravity. The resulting quantum space-times resolve the singularity present in the classical theory inside black holes.
[Loop quantum gravity]( is one very, very theoretical alternative to the already very, very theoretical string theory, and to a host of others. It constructs space and time - and matter fields - from a flow of information through an abstract network of spin states, following cellular automata like rules. As these evolve over time - sort of, cf Rovelli and Connes, notion of 'thermal time' a sort of winding down of everything - the ""spin foam"" gives rise to space and the sequence of time. Our world is a lesser projection of this higher reality - the bulk. One of the interesting predictions of the theory (Turok, Bojoworld) is that spacetime (sort of) has a maximum permitted density: the very dense becomes dual with the less dense, reversing things. Thus, singularities are forbidden and cosmic collapses lead to Big Bounces, which also does away with the need for an inflation mechanism. What I think that this paper is claiming is that at sufficient density, the bulk generates stuff ('observables') which amount to different space times. You coudl interpret this as saying that a collapse spawns new universes, or you could not. ";0;1f9ha2;[]

It is estimated a 1500-qubit quantum processor would be needed and whether it actually works practically isn't really known since these larger scale quantum chips can't be simulated.

From the sound of it, what he's done is to help delineate where quantum and classical computing part ways.

They skip a few steps that aren't necessary.
If an electron is an electron is an electron, they can still trade different properties according to the specific context, before you measure them. Their properties express humble and elegant simplicity as the Two Faces of Janus exchanging identities. An electron is both indivisible in its particle-like state and infinitely divisible as a wave-like aspect. Its related to Mach's Conjecture, local and nonlocal effects.

But the quantum computers we have now are error-prone and don't have enough qubits to allow for error correction. The only demonstrations we've had involve quantum computing hardware evolving out of a random configuration and traditional computers failing to simulate their normal behavior. Useful calculations are an exercise for the future.
But a new paper from Google's quantum computing group has now moved beyond these sorts of demonstrations and used a quantum computer as part of a system that can help us understand quantum systems in general, rather than the quantum computer. And they show that, even on today's error-prone hardware, the system can outperform classical computers on the same problem.";0;v9wj42;[]

Not sure what complexity man created that 100,000 now only = 4, unless there was lot redundancy that the machine did not need to account for.
And not sure how this can be used unless we're really inefficient with data and relied heavily on brute force calculations which is sad if true or you would not have such a huge difference in the outcome.
It is interesting but don't see this as a major breakthrough in most things, as everyone tend to make different code and data sets. how long did it take to read the 100,000 data vs 4 is it 10 hrs faster now or 0.10 seconds?

Electrons dont behave independently like, say, cue balls; quantum effects result in changes to one electron affecting the behaviour of the whole system, which may consist of any number of atoms. The number of equations required to describe increasingly large systems of electrons grows very rapidly, similarly to factorials. What the NN has done is to find hidden patterns between the separate equations to generate a small number of problems that describe the systems interactions identically.

Give it 50-100 years. Sadly, the people who fund this research only want to see results and thus we see overhyped popsci articles like this :P
Edit: The reason I say useless is because of decoherence. Quantum computers are more likely to mess up a computation because qubits are more fragile than classical bits. To do any large scale computation with a quantum computer, you need it to be fault-tolerant. Fault-tolerance requires encoding your qubits into many qubits with quantum error correcting codes. We then will need millions of qubits to do this, along with better control over them than we have now. If I put my money any company investing in this technology, it would not be D-wave, IBM, or google. I think Psi-Quantum has the best chance of doing something sooner. They have the go big or go home approach, focusing all their efforts on making fault-tolerant qubits. Unfortunately, they are pretty secretive about their progress.
Also, I am not appealing to the fallacy that abstract math has no purpose if we dont immediately see its value. In fact, I think everyone in this thread should learn as much as they can about quantum computing. Go and download Nielsen and Chuang or watch some lectures on YouTube. Get your hands dirty and play with this stuff! Maybe youll make the next big step!";0;ls1ifr;[]

IN SIMPLE TERMS:
Quantum teleportation is about information. It is sending information about the ""quantum state"" (the mathematical variables regarding a system) of a particular particle from one point to another. In the future, it might be useful for things like GPS systems and *really fast-loading porn*.
Normal teleportation is what you're thinking about. That's more akin to if you were to pick yourself apart, atom by atom, with tweezers or the like, and reassembled yourself elsewhere. You'd probably die in the process unless it was happening at near the speed of light, yeah, but it does raise some interesting philosophical questions regarding things like ""if you DID pick yourself apart, atom by atom, and put yourself back together - would you be the same person?""

Let's assume that your are living on the East Coast and that you have friend on the West Coast. Let's furthermore assume, that you have a common friend living somewhere in Iowa.
Your friend in Iowa has two bottles with marbles: One bottle with red marbles, another bottle with blue marbles. Your friend picks two marbles from one bottle. Therefore both marbles have the same color (which you don't know yet) and represent entangled photons for our thought experiment.
Now your friend in Iowa sends each of you a package with one of the two ""entangled"" marbles, that both have the same color. The package arrives and you know, that there's a marble in the package. You don't know the color of the marble. For you the color of the marble could be anything. You only know that the marbles you and your friend have received have the same color.
You open the package and find a blue marble and you know immediately, that your friend has received a blue marble as well. That's, um, obvious and on a basic level everything that happens with quantum entanglement. But how can you use that phenomenon to tell your friend, that you will visit him in two weeks?
The answer is: You can't! The marble of your friend won't immediately change from blue to red, when you paint your marble red, but that would be necessary to establish a communication through quantum entanglement. You can only tell your friend to paint his marble red too, but that has to happen with a conventional communication device, that cannot exceed the speed of light. --- ---
In quantum mechanics things are bit different and more complicated of course. In quantum mechanics the package can contain more than just one marble, and the marbles can have different shapes and colors. And you don't need a friend in Iowa to make sure, that you don't know the content of the package until you open the package. Quantum mechanics do that for you. When you open the package, you receive a random result. And once you have opened the package, you can change the content as much as you want, it won't affect the content of the other package. That's not how quantum entanglement work.
But it's even worse in quantum physics: The content of the package is also determined by how you open the package. Open the package at midnight and you receive a marble. Open the package in the morning and you may find a dice. The troublesome but also interesting thing (for cryptography and quantum computers) is, that the content of the package can be BOTH even after you and your friend have opened the packages (in quantum mechanics ""opening the package"" means measuring the state of the particles in a specific way). Let's assume that you open the package at midnight and find a marble. The package of your friend and the West Coast contains a marble as well? Yes, but only of our friend opens his package at midnight as well. But if he opens his package in the morning, he will find a dice. To make sure that you both find a marble, you'd have to tell your friend, that he has to open his package at midnight, and that can - you guessed it already - only happen through conventional communication devices.
Superluminal communication via quantum entanglement is impossible because you always need an additional communication channel, that cannot exceed the speed of light. And teleportation is impossible as well since you can't modify the photon and it's entangled twin. Quantum entanglement simply doesn't work that way (and it will never; that's not just a technological barrier).

In its present form, the entangled particles transmit data instantaneously, but become unentangled after transmitting(but remain in that state for a while afterwards.
The caveat is that they have to be entangled together and then transmitted to their destination, at which point you can transmit the data once.
So, with technological maturity, could you, in theory, could you send a constant stream of these entangled particles to various locations(at light speed) using fiber optics, steadily building up a ""reservoir"" of entangled particles which could then be used to transmit much larger waves of data, but only intermittently?
Theoretically setting up a sort of early-telephones switchboard.
The Quantum Telephone office has connections to nearby buildings, and then connects to a central ""repository"", which receives and redistributes the data in big packets?
Functionally, massive throughput in small periods of time, I think. Maybe good for super long distance data transfer of high volumes where it's actually more efficient to load everything onto a hard drive and then ship it to your destination using traditional means? Obviously, working from a a layman's perspective, just trying to brainstorm how this, in its current iteration might be useful.";0;kojtvm;[]

While scientist work an quantum computers, they will also work on post quantum cryptography - and there is no fundamental reason a normal computer won't be able to use a quantum resistant encryption algorithm.
However scientists like this are mostly over-optimistic with time, and as someone who works in science myself I can tell you this has mostly to do with funding. If you are honest about expecting results in 30 years, you will have a hard time to get money. As far as I know quantum computers are nowhere near cracking actual encryption.
ALSO... The article claims SHA-256 will be broken, and I'm not aware of any quantum algorithm that could crack SHA-256. There is a realistic threat in quantum computers breaking elliptic curve functions (asymmetric cryptography, getting private keys from public keys). However in blockchains like BTC, addresses are generated by hashing from public keys and the pub. keys are only published once you spend. This means even BTC is ""sort-of"" quantum resistant today if you never reuse addresses.";0;10i8mgp;[]

The head developer (Colin Cantrell) is the son of one of SpaceX's co-founders (Jim Cantrell, VP of Business Development). Jim is currently working on providing transport to space for the purpose of delivering cubesats into orbit via Vector Space Systems. I think.

Existing Blockchain technology could face a fatal impact. So, current blockchains will require their own migration. This will likely take the form of a fork or a protocol update, creating a new post-quantum chain or addresses and a limited window of time for users to migrate their data and assets. Even if everyone takes the same protection measures, quantum computers might eventually become so fast that they will undermine the Bitcoin transaction process. In this case, the security of the Bitcoin blockchain will be fundamentally broken. The only solution, in this case, is to transition to a new type of cryptography called post-quantum cryptography.

Quantum entanglement occurs when you can precisely align two particles in just the right way (that's not to say it can't occur randomly in nature). In this case we are talking about electrons. Theoretically, you can entangle any property of two particles. Practically, we do this with spin. Spin is the property of electrons which is effectively a little bar magnet which can either be pointed up or down. North on top South on bottom or vice versa. We can entangle the spin of two electrons, but it is very difficult to do at room temperature because there's a lot of heat. Heat causes things to jiggle around so aligning things (entangling the particles) is very tough.
When two particles are entangled and their spin is measured you immediately know how the spin of the other particle will be measured. It could be on the other side of the universe and you would be able to know it's spin. From a practical stand point the ability to do this will help with quantum computers as qbits require a similar preparation to the electrons I just described. Unfortunately instant long distance communication via this method is theoretically impossible, but that's another post.";0;3tllus;[]

quantum teleportation lets you send quantum information (qubits) to someone over a network that only allows you to send classical information (bits). this is nice because we already have an extensive network to send bits around the world (the internet), and we couldn't simply use the the same technology to send qubits to each other. quantum teleportation allows us to use our pre-existing networks, as long as the sender and the receiver have some pre-established entangled particles. it essentially ""uses up"" their entangled particles in exchange for ""teleporting"" quantum information over classical information channels.

1. You take two cardboard wheels with bar magnets on them, which if held flat faced to each other rotate until facing opposite directions. 2. You hold each wheel inside separate boxes so they're both unseen.
3. You hold the boxes near each other, feeling movement. You know they've aligned opposite to each other, but you dont know which direction either is facing yet.
4. You have someone else take one box to the other side of the city, carefully not rotating the wheel inside. Each magnet is in a ""superposition"", both and neither facing up or down, but whichever one is, the other is the opposite.

Their states are sort of cloned and thus will forever behave in the same exact way until interrupted. They aren't communicating, they just behave the same way so you can tell how the other behaved by looking at the first one, and this is true no matter how far they are from each other as long as their journey didn't impact them in any way. There is no communication or classical ""teleportation"" there either lol.
It's like spinning two coins in the same direction using the exact same power, running off to the other room with one where it landed on heads and knowing the other coin in the other room also landed on heads. The difference is that the particles can technically cointinue spinning in the exact same way until you stop one of them. So you can read its position at any given time and know that's also where the other one is, except that it's hard to read their state without interrupting them. Sort of like it being hard to measure something's temperature using a cold thermometer without first touching it with it and making it a bit colder in the process, no longer getting an accurate reading.
Now what the article is explaining is that they managed to safely send those particles (spinning coins) away from each other using a fibre network cable without interrupting their spins.

Heisenberg is just as uncertain as he has always been. A qubit is a bit that can exist in a superposition of 1 and 0. That means that when you 'measure' the qubit you have a certain chance of observing a 1, and a certain chance of observing a 0.
You can, by the way, think of the bits in your computer as special cases of qubits, where they are in one of two states: (state 1) 100% chance to measure 1 or (state 2) 100% chance to measure 0.
A qubit meanwhile, could be prepared in (state 3): 50% chance to measure 0, 50% chance to measure 1, or (state 4): 75% chance to measure 0, 25% chance to measure 1, or any one of an infinite number of states.
Qubits are exposed to a lot of noise from the environment ( like electromagnetic waves and whatnot. ) Noise can change the state of a qubit, perhaps moving a qubit that was in state 3 to state 3.01: 51% 0, 49% 1. You might think of this noise as 'partial measurement', because it changes the state of the qubit, but only sorta.
What these guys are saying, is that they are able to track this partial measurement as it occurs to their qubit. So, if they know they prepared a qubit in state 3; they can watch the noise that happens to it; and know that its been transferred to a different state.
They cannot control the noise. They can only monitor how the state of the qubit is changing. Importantly, they still don't know if they are going to see a 0 or 1 when they measure it, they only know that the state has changed.
I hope that was clear, helpful and accurate!

The major novelty here is that a partial, non-demolition measurement was carried out with superconducting qubitsthe new poster child of experimental quantum information processing. With photons, this has been done long ago (and I'm sort of annoyed that a lot of very similar work on this field wasn't cited in the Yale study).
Just like any QM text-book will tell you, a measurement of a quantum state will collapse that state onto some observable. We don't have to extract full information though, we can also partially collapse the state, by weakly coupling it to an ancilla and then reading out the ancilla projectively. Such a weak measurement ""preserves"" the original qubit, but it disturbs the state, with the back-action being proportional to the amount of retrieved information.
The point they make in the paper is that the post-measurement state is not predictable, but once they know the outcome, they can precisely determine the back-action and feed back a corresponding correction on the initial state.
Importantly, they only performed this measurement on a single qubit, not on an entangled multi-qubit state. That would be much harder, and the remaining entanglement in the state would be reduced by an amount proportional to the measurement strength. Importantly, it would not be as straightforward to get an entangled state back to where it started with the demonstrated feedback method.";0;16jpg5;[]

1. This doesn't mean we can measure the state of the qubit without collapsing it: this is mathematically impossible because of the no-cloning theorem. If it was violated we would have to redo all of quantum physics.
2. This doesn't mean that different kinds of quantum computing are possible, it's making one form of quantum error correction more viable. The title is absolutely misleading and we cannot ""observe quantum information while preserving its integrity.""
3. This doesn't break quantum encryption since you're not monitoring the qubit before it's sent to you in order to detect a change; if you could, you could simply see what orientation the qubit was and break it anyways.
4. A qubit doesn't store x amount of information. The most information a single qubit can store is 1 bit, since it can only be measured to be 1 or 0. If, however, we are assuming we could look right at a qubit without disturbing it, it would store an infinitude of information since the state can be defined by 3 real parameters (the complex amplitudes of the 1 and 0 states can be parametrized by 3 real variables.) I saw something in this thread that was upvoted suggesting it could store a only finitely many bits of information if you could view the state. It could ""store"" much more if this was possible, but it's not.
5. This is only useful insofar as it improves the fidelity of quantum operations and makes standard quantum error correction strong enough to enable an arbitrarily large quantum computer. In fact, all quantum error correction circuits rely on the ability to measure deviations due to the environment in one or a few of the qubits and then correct those qubits.

Using weak measurements, however, it is possible to operationally define a set of trajectories for an ensemble of quantum particles. >We sent single photons emitted by a quantum dot through a double-slit interferometer and reconstructed these trajectories by performing a weak measurement of the photon momentum, post-selected according to the result of a strong measurement of photon position in a series of planes. The results provide an observationally grounded description of the propagation of sub-ensembles of quantum particles in a two-slit interferometer.
The most remarkable diagram is shown [here]( These contours reconstruct the average trajectories of single photons as they move from one slit (not both) to their strike on the detector. The conceptual implications of this are considerable, but I won't explore them here. The point of this post is that measurements of this sort yield useful information, if not information about the uncollapsed wave state. Indeed, what coudl information about an indeterminate state look like, except.. indeterminate? ";0;16jpg5;[]

>>We're dealing with the very first steps of modelling reality, and Google says we could start to see applications in all kinds of systems involving chemistry: improved batteries, flexible electronics, new types of materials, and more.
>>One potential use is modelling the way bacteria produce fertiliser. The way humans produce fertiliser is extremely inefficient in terms of the environment, and costs 1-2 percent of the world's energy per year so any improvements in understanding the chemical reactions involved could produce massive gains.
Among the many exciting things here, I'm especially excited about the potential for battery breakthroughs.
Now that solar power is operating under its own Moore's Law of constantly increasing in efficiency and decreasing in price and is over taking fossil fuels, the last piece of the jigsaw here is battery tech to enable us to truly make efficient use of renewable energy.

Which have varying spin. sometimes the positioning is a superposition, so it's spinning everywhere and nowhere at the same time until some event happens to 'lock' it into a state.

It's discovered that there's far more hidden in Pi in hex and binary and various other numerical methods of storing data... Like the secrets of Faster than Light travel, and locations. All of them, 700 million light years away, in the area of space known as the Botes Void.... Where there ought to be between 2,000 and 6,000 galaxies, and instead only 60 have been discovered.

This is something nobody does because CCSD is one of the most accurate and expensive methods in quantum chemistry and using a minimal basis guarantees that the result isn't going to be useful. If you look at figure 3b their error reaches 0.02 Hartree, which is very far from what we call [chemical accuracy]( - about 0.0016 Hartree. Actually, more accurate calculations were done in the [1960s]( an back then Koos and Wolniewicz didn't even use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The authors of this article did some ground-breaking work inventing algorithms to employ quantum annealing for electronic structure calculations, which is awesome, but they purposefully chose a simple problem (using a minimal basis they have just one parameter to optimize) to find out which one of their two alternative approaches works better. The pop-sci article is full of shit and calling these calculations accurate is laughable.;0;4uhlc3;[]

Most of the cosmos in space and in time is too hot or too cold or too dense or too sparse or too chaotic or too stagnant for life. Even in this precious moment and special place we call Earth there have already been 5 major extinctions. The last one was 65million years ago and wiped out the colossal dinosaurs. 99% of species have been previously wiped out. Just a few years ago a tsunami wiped out 200,000 of us in a single day. That's .03% of our population because of a splash of water. While we are the most knowledgeable beings ever to have lived on Earth and can possibly detect meteors and comets on a collision course and change their trajectories and to some extent foresee conditions build up for likely tornadoes, hurricane paths, earthquakes, tsunamis we are also smart enough to build nuclear weapons and disrupt the climate and poison our own water supply. Even if we can survive these natural and man made hazards the sun will one day engold our planet and the Milky Way will collide with andromeda and the universe will expand to near absolute zero temperatures. The feelings of altruism, love, sympathy are all programmed into our DNA to help those close to us, most especially our children, as they carry our genes. An AI has no genes. It knows not love for a child. It has no feelings. It has no fear. It understands not pain. Those are things that eventually could be programmed into it but it's a tricky endeavor that can backfire on us. Eventually it will have no need for us. In fact, it may find that we may be consuming some of the same resources it will need. It may see us as we see bacteria or viruses. A virus is arguably not even a living thing. A super general purpose AI would consider us barely conscious. We can only see what's directly in front of us. We barely remember the things we've learned in college. We can only read one item at a time. Our communication is slow and limited. A higher being could kill us with no remorse. We are by comparison, nothing special. So I am not sure that they would have our best interest in mind in the long run. Some of the best minds have been tackling this AI issue and feel that one way or another it eventually does not end well for us. But if we can create this super being that can thrive and go on in space and time far beyond what we could have ever dreamed of with our limited minds and bodies then maybe it's time we pass on the baton and let the universe know itself better than we could have ever begun to imagine. ;0;4uhlc3;[]

[Google]( and [Cloudflare]( takes the quantum computing threat seriously along with the [NSA]( and [NIST]( I'd say these are folks that we could pay attention to.
For blockchain projects:
* QRL is natively post-quantum resistant ([Using XMSS, draft recommended by NIST \[pdf\]]( by default.
* QRL will be bringing the option to be post-quantum secure to Ethereum wallets with [enqlave.io]( \- just needs an audit!
* ADA seems interested in it, though opted for ECC for more features.
* Monero is [doing research](
* IOTA has it, but will be [switching to ECC ED25519]( as default for more features.
While quantum computers aren't going to break blockchains today, projects have a lot to do to prepare and it's not as straight forward as one might think as post-quantum crypto is [not likely going to be a drop-in replacement for ECC \[NIST/NCCoE\]]( Even assuming every project flicks a switch and instantly reaches a consensus, integrates everything, tests, audits, and releases their fork which gives the ability for post-quantum addresses, there's still the time to migrate. Seeing as that most are their own bank (not your keys, not your crypto!), only the end user can do their migration, and it can plausibly take a while. I don't recommend it, but conversely, your crypto would be safer on a centralized exchange in this scenario as they have staff on hand to handle the migration! This is the same scenario with banks - which are centralized with IT staff on hand to handle a migration, so also wont have a problem.
How long will it take for individuals to migrate when there's security ramifications? Well, we can take a look at Windows 7, which according to [Net Marketshare](, has a 22% marketshare as of 2020-08, which reached EoL in [2020-01]( This is in spite of the security risk, which Microsoft states clearly: ""Support for Windows 7 ended on January 14, 2020. If you are still using Windows 7, *your PC may become more vulnerable to security risks*"". It should be noted that at the time of that announcement... 26% of people were using Windows 7, so even after nearly a year there's been a change of \~4%.
If it takes 2 years to migrate (low estimate considering the above), then you're really looking at the time that ECC is broken and going backwards in time from that estimate. In this example, if it's broken in 2022, and it takes 2 years to migrate, you should have had post-quantum addresses ready by 2020 to start the migration, and as a friendly reminder that's not including consensus, development, testing, and audits. As certain blockchain features that rely on ECC are more difficult or infeasible to do with post-quantum crypto, this can negatively impact the development and migration timelines. [Quantum attacks on bitcoin, and how to protect against them gave 2027 as an optimistic estimate](
Even with that under consideration, on any given year it's not a 0% or 100% chance of being broken but instead has a cumulative probability. It also doesn't take into account the value of what's being broken. One of our community members put [together a model]( that articulates this. Put another way, is a 1% chance too high, 50%? That's going to depend on each individual and individual project. For 300 Billion of value, I'd like to think 1% is too high, while for a dog house, I doubt I'd even care if it had a 99% probability of being broken - [some dogs might have a different risk tolerance, however](
Michele Mosca, co-founder and deputy director of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, breaks down this risk assessment in [business terms pretty well](";0;ipn127;[]

Currently, the fastest quantum computer (that isn't even market available yet) can do 2^(53) possible combinations of bits in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. It would take 2^(203) cycles to be able to break Bitcoin private and public addresses and render them useless. That would be the equivalent to roughly 8.15 10^(15) years to perform such an operation . In that time, Bitcoin could easily just add more possible addresses through another hardfork which changes the address format. Using Moore's Law, we can expect the rate of improvement of quantum computers to double every two years. Even if that happens, it will take 406 years to be able to completely break Bitcoin.

But then the QC hacker needs to spend your funds faster than you. So if you don't reuse addresses that's of little concern because of the block time being too short (probably).
Now for a QC to guess your pvt key from your pub key alone, that's basically guess work. With roughly 2^128 possibilities (roughly 10^38 and no, it is not the whole 256 bits), the QC would need to find it in a reasonable time (before, say, the owner moves it to another cold storage).
Let's say a reasonable time is 1 year (actually it would weeks or less), that gives 10^38 addresses to be tested within the ""reasonable time"" of 1 year.
Let's dumbly map that to hash per second. Currently the mining power is at 150 EH/s. that's about 1.5 * 10^19. Now we are close to the square root of the amount, so that means you would need all the mining power currently available squared, which means the QC would need to do the job of 1 trillion copies of current all mining farms, 10 million times faster. (or vice-versa, or other combination).
We could go on and calculate how many superposed states the machine would need to achieve all of this. The bottom line is that you would probably lack materials or energy, or would hit another constraint because of the sheer size.
ps: it is just a dumb back of the envelope estimate, there are many considerations such as how much power does it drain, maybe there is not even enough available power in the energetic matrix, because a QC is not an standalone machine and uses classical computers around it to churn numbers classically which are generated by the QC superposition states.
ps:2: when that becomes a concern, we can always increase the size of the keys, say, to 1024 bits. But that's also not that easy because any new curve needs some proofs (and proofs are always tentative based on many assumptions that can be incomplete or not very good).";0;ipn127;[]

My understanding of what will be possible with superposition based hashing is that a 256qbit processor could solve/find a bitcoin block ""instantly"" ( instantly = 1 plank second ). This is of course the theoretical limit as electronic communication to and from the processor is the liability. Regardless of the difficulty algorithm adjustments that take place after each block is mined, a 256qbit processor will mine every unmined bitcoin left in less than 1 full second. This will also lead to an absurd level of difficulty so that the rest of the mining pool wouldnt be able to solve a block for millions of years. Proof of work is kind of whooptydo anyway, the value was in the consensus and the consensus is something that a qbit processor, itself, cant do anything about. However, a qbit based decryptor could decrypt your keys very easily. So if someone had one and looked at your on-chain transactions with it, they could fool the consensus into allowing them to make transactions for you simply by using your keys. But your data provider could already do this; if you've ever sent any crypto, even the private ones like monero, across a data provider like At&t then they have had access to your personal data, even if it was encrypted, this whole time and couldve transacted, on-chain, on your behalf. The qbit processor just speeds up what can already be done. Qbit computation is really powerful but the true value of quantum tech in terms of blockchains and financial ecosystems will be the properties of quantum entanglement and the ability to transmit data across any space instantly. We are literally talking about the emergence of a galactic economy that uses qbit encrypted blockchain based currencies, but can you imagine using the same currency a light year away while using a communication method that transmits through light? No, the lag time over the value of the currency would make such things prohibitive up until we make the consensus and communication mechanisms instantaneous. Eventually when we migrate to mars or the asteroid belt, we simply will not tolerate the volatility inherent to a multi-minute lag time inherent to the speed of light; quantum entanglement based communication rails and consensus algorithms will be required before then.";0;ipn127;[]

As I understand it. They changed the problem so that each grid member has a quantum superposition of different states (ie vectors of quantities for the all regiments and all the ranks).
Then, they redefined what it means for two people to be different from simply having a different regiment and rank, to instead mean that the vectors of each of those people are perpendicular (orthogonal) to each other.";0;t1l724;[]

When processing data with qubits opposed to standard binary bits. Unlike processing data using standard computing bits which exists as a 0 or 1 a qubit can be a 0, 1, or a superposition of both. The superpositional state of the qubit opens up drastically more computational potential to analyze and output all potential outcomes instead of just one or another. This is why you see different companies like IBM and Google racing to develop coherent quantum computers with more qubits to tackle these issues. For the same reasons, quantum computing is going to absolutely shred todays data and security encryption standards once it become more efficient.;0;t1l724;[]

One way to do this is through the use of a quantum time evolution operator, which describes how a quantum system changes over time.
In the case of the ""quantum time flip"", the researchers used a special optical crystal to split a photon, or packet of light, into two paths. One path traveled through the crystal, while the other path did not. The researchers found that the path of the photon through the crystal exhibited a temporal behavior known as ""time reversal,"" in which the photon appeared to travel backward in time.
This effect is not the same as true time travel, as it does not involve the actual reversal of the flow of time. Instead, it is a quantum phenomenon that arises due to the way that the quantum system is prepared and measured.
It is important to note that this type of quantum time manipulation is still a subject of active research and is not fully understood. Further study is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and potential applications of these phenomena.";0;zloibj;[]

The text even decrees that the man lying down with his head placed in the opposite direction is sick.
""Extensive research has investigated the flow of energy in relation to health. For example, people who sleep in an east-west position have a much shorter REM (rapid eye movement) cycle than do those who sleep with the head oriented to the north, and this is the cycle during which dreams occur.

1) Quantum computers are very hard to control considering it's ""quantum"" and very sensitive i.e. there is a chance that your 1 or 0 could be both or none which allows super-positioning for quantum computer (wiki: qubit) but also more errors from like your elbow hitting the table.

This article is basically saying researchers finally have a 300-bit quantum computer. To represent the state of an n-qubit system on a classical computer would require the storage of 2^n complex coefficients. That would mean 2^300 complex coefficients on a classical computer. Up until now, scientists have been finding it really hard to create large quantum bit configurations. (where large is more than 16 or so) Let it also be known that general purpose quantum decryption has a time complexity of O( 2^n/2 ) where n is keylength in bits. This is half the degree of general purpose normal decryption, which is awesome, but all you have to do is double the keylength for all your encryption. (and not use RSA encryption) So they have a quantum computer with a lot more memory.;0;stjso;[]

QKD is not ""un-hackable"", it's just a more secure solution to the key exchange problem. This means you will now be able tell when someone intercepted the key exchange (from within the fiber network) and can renegotiate a new key exchange that isn't compromised. This would make Man-in-the-middle attacks more difficult, but not impossible. Those fiber endpoint servers are still going to be accessed through the conventional internet meaning an attacker can still intercept the key negotiation anywhere outside the fiber network without anyone knowing. Also, once the key exchange is complete, the rest of the communication between the two parties will take place over conventional internet relying on encryption for security. Theoretically, a truly dedicated party could still save this exchange to a server somewhere and eventually brute-force it over the course of many, many, many years or wait for a quantum computer to come along that is able to decrypt it using Shor's algorithm or some variation. This is why QKD needs to be combined with truly quantum-safe algorithms to protect encryption-based communication in the age of quantum computers, and currently none exist.
TLDR: Calling QKD ""un-hackable"" is completely misguided, it would be more accurate to say this will allow for more secure communications in the future but I suppose that wouldn't generate as many ""clicks"" as the current headline.";0;ny3g3u;[]

Light based communication via fiber optic cable is easily intercepted. Using qubits and quantum entanglement for data transfer would be much harder to intercept, mostly because the average person knows nothing about quantum engineering or how it works. But also because with quantum entanglement, there can't really be a middleman.
I don't even really know how it works, but here's one from the University of Innsbruck: [](

>The quantum internet promises absolutely tap-proof communication and powerful distributed sensor networks for new science and technology. However, because quantum information cannot be copied, it is not possible to send this information over a classical network. Quantum information must be transmitted by quantum particles, and special interfaces are required for this. The Innsbruck-based experimental physicist Ben Lanyon, who was awarded the Austrian START Prize in 2015 for his research, is researching these important intersections of a future quantum Internet. Now his team at the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck and at the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information of the Austrian Academy of Sciences has achieved a record for the transfer of quantum entanglement between matter and light. For the first time, a distance of 50 kilometers was covered using fiber optic cables. ""This is two orders of magnitude further than was previously possible and is a practical distance to start building inter-city quantum networks,"" says Ben Lanyon.";0;ny3g3u;[]

There is some trickery that can be done with single photon states, but that requires optical qnd measurements, which are still very difficult to produce, and have loss rates that are too high. This means that these systems are limited to classical repeaters and the BB84, scheme which is the most brittle, lacks a lot of security properties you might want, due to the high loss. What is really wanted is the use of the E91 protocol. And that requires either repeaters every 15 or so km. Much power loss repeaters, or moving quantum states in a way other than optic fibres.

Quantum Key Distribution, QKD, is mathematically proven to be indecipherable. This is *without* making any assumptions on Eve (the attacking eavesdropper), but only a few on Alice and Bob (sender and receiver).
What QKD does is use qubits to create a one-time key to a cypher. This key is created using quantum mechanics (perfectly random) and privacy amplification (shortening the random key using classical cyphers) to create something that cannot be duplicated except by random chance. Once you have your key, you can use that to create a message which is indecipherable.
What that means is that the only way for someone to control what is being sent or received has to physically take over the material sending and receiving the qubits. Why is that? Why is the only way to beat QKD is to physically take over both the sender and receiver? Because of QBER.
QBER is the Quantum Bit Error Rate. It is a number which is more or less unique to each QKD communication line. This is a gross simplification, but it can be understood as the % of times a qubit being sent is modified by the environment. If you have Eve trying to find out what Alice is sending to Bob, she will have to measure the qubits and will end up changing their state. This increases the QBER, which can be detected by both Alice and Bob, and means that they can stop exchanging the key and figure out what is happening.
Since no actual message has been sent, only a key, even if Eve gets any parts of that key, she doesnt actually gain any information since there was no message. Alice and Bob can keep on making new keys until the QBER is at a number which tells them there are no opponents listening in. This method is perfectly unhackable.";0;ny3z76;[]

Neither of these are true - quantum computers certainly can't compete with regular computers for every problem, but there's a rapidly growing list of real-world problems that we know they'll be useful for. Here's a few:
* **Molecular simulation.** Microsoft Research, for example, want to use this problem to design cheap, ecological fertilizers, but others are interested in drug design and materials science (inc. room temp superconductors).
* **Search.** This could just be used for searching through lists of data, but is a more generic tool for just brute-force searching for an answer to a particular hard problem.
* **Optimisation.** The quantum search algorithm gives a modest advantage for optimisation problems on a quantum computer, but is a bit of a blunt tool; researchers have recently written down some quantum algorithms for solving commonly encountered optimisation problems (e.g. semidefinite programs). Early days, but looks promising.
* **Network/graph problems.** Really interesting class of problems if you want to efficiently direct internet traffic, or run a logistics company, or understand biological/sociological networks... the list is endless. There have been lots of new quantum algorithms recently for solving graph problems more quickly, including a gem of a paper on [the travelling salesman problem]( * **Simultaneous equations.** A quantum algorithm for speeding up simultaneous equation solving was published in '09: [Here]( Useful on its own, but is probably going to find more application as a subroutine for machine learning/AI problems.
* **Differential equations.** Among other things, differential equations are ubiquitous in engineering; and solving them numerically is important if, say, you want to model air flow through a turbine, or heat in an engine, or stress on a skyscraper. Here's a paper showing that [quantum computers can be faster at solving differential equations](
* **Monte Carlo methods.** These methods are currently used to help solve a wide-range of problems where some statistical or probabilistic element is involved, e.g. weather forecasting/climate modelling, AI, computational biology and computer graphics (the wiki page has a more [complete list]( Quantum computers have an advantage here, too: [Quantum monte carlo](
* **Machine learning / AI.** There have been lots of published papers outlining specific machine learning tasks that can be sped up by quantum means, but the quality tends to vary wildly. One of my favourites is [a quantum algorithm for the ""Netflix problem""](, where a computer has to recommend new products based on a user's review of things they've already purchased. [Here]( is a decent review of machine learning/AI applications of quantum computers.
Here's a great review, for those interested:

That has lots of exciting potential applications.
In other forms of detection, the quantum state of the photon is projected (and so lost), which would be no good for quantum communications/networking etc. What the team has done is a very difficult experiment, managing to interact with the photon enough to detect its presence without destroying it, but they have not broken the uncertainty principle.

Less simple: They used some mirrors with a certain setup that would only allow certain photons through, the one's that do get through come out the same way they came in. When they see one like that they can look at its phase which, because of the mirror bouncing, is flipped. Detecting the phase alone doesn't completely destroy the quantum state though. So basically we're changing two variables the photon has, and by reading one you can infer the other is also different, but because we're not directly reading the other variable, we don't screw with it's quantum state. This doesn't give us the whole ""omg quantum computers"" we wanted but it does mean that we can test a single photon repeatedly before it completely loses its quantum state, which is better than having it collapse on the very first measurement.

Youve pulled some information out of it, so you do wind up affecting it, he says.

In the text of the article we find that the scientists were able to gather *partial* information on the photons ""without *completely* destroying it"" (emphasis added by me).
This means that the scientists were able to gather *partial* information on the photon at the cost of *partially* collapsing its quantum state. This is not a new idea and **in no way changes our understanding of quantum mechanics.**
Now at the same time the subtitle of the article reads
""Technique to sense particles *without changing their quantum states* holds promise for quantum networks.""
which is plain false. The quantum states are changed, just not as dramatically as if they had measured complete information on the state.
Similarly the title of this thread says that the scientists ""have now devised a way to detect single photons of visible light without changing *any* of the information that they carry."" Again this is completely false.
Quantum theory predicts that the degree to which a quantum state changes is directly related to how much information you gain about it, so while what these scientists did has practical importance it should not be branded as if they did something previously thought to be impossible.

>Technology continues to move forward at incredible speeds and it seems like every week we learn about a new breakthrough that changes our minds about what is possible.
>Researchers in Toronto used a photonic quantum computer chip to solve a sampling problem that went way beyond the fastest computers and algorithms.
>The paper the researchers published says that the Borealis quantum chip took only 36 microseconds to solve a problem that would take supercomputers and algorithms 9,000 years to figure out.
>Yes, you read that right9,000 years.
>The Borealis chip uses bursts of light to transmit quantum information and the researchers believe that this is a huge leap forward for quantum chips.
>""The authors of the study said,
>This work is a critical milestone on the path to a practical quantum computer, validating key technological features of photonics as a platform for this goal.
>Quantum computers are different from traditional computers and one major way is to process three units of data instead of only two. The computers we are used to use binary (0, 1) and quantum computers use what is called qubits (0, 1, both).
>While this news is certainly exciting, quantum computers still have a long road ahead of them. The UK Ministry of Defence purchased its first quantum computer in order to run tests, but it could be years before we know how or when theyll be used regularly.
Here is the paper.
And if I'm not mistaken a photonic quantum computer can run at room temperature.

- I am using my linux personal computer at home, firstly I am transferring files off a device on to the hard disk drive(HDD) using the inbuilt file manager GUI to copy and paste this often freezes during the process and takes a lot of time. Secondly I am transferring the same files to an external drive using the terminal (command line) and generally this is a lot faster and more reliable however very rarely this freezes up during transfer of medium size files too.

No photonic machine offering programmability over all its quantum gates has demonstrated quantum computational advantage: previous machines1,2 were largely restricted to static gate sequences. Earlier photonic demonstrations were also vulnerable to spoofing3, in which classical heuristics produce samples, without direct simulation, lying closer to the ideal distribution than do samples from the quantum hardware. Here we report quantum computational advantage using Borealis, a photonic processor offering dynamic programmability on all gates implemented. We carry out Gaussian boson sampling4 (GBS) on 216 squeezed modes entangled with three-dimensional connectivity5, using a time-multiplexed and photon-number-resolving architecture. On average, it would take more than 9,000years for the best available algorithms and supercomputers to produce, using exact methods, a single sample from the programmed distribution, whereas Borealis requires only 36s. This runtime advantage is over 50 million times as extreme as that reported from earlier photonic machines. Ours constitutes a very large GBS experiment, registering events with up to 219 photons and a mean photon number of 125. This work is a critical milestone on the path to a practical quantum computer, validating key technological features of photonics as a platform for this goal""

[](
As a High Performance Computing research scientist, Ill say that while the article linked in the OP is very surface level and clickbaity, the findings of this study are legitimately of significant value. Yes the quantum computer was working on a problem that QCs may be particularly good at but that doesnt mean that the findings or the 9000 years stat is worthless. The supercomputer they were comparing to, Fugaku, is an incredibly powerful system (one of the best in the world).
Supercomputers also are really only good at certain types of problems - those that can be distributed and parallelized. Most processors in a supercomputer are clocked slower than those in a desktop gaming computer. The main difference is that in a supercomputer, there are hundreds to thousands of processors. But that fact doesnt make supercomputing research worthless. Quantum computers are similar and are really good at certain types of problems - while that may make it seem less flashy to a general audience, the demonstration of its capabilities in those types of problems is still incredibly relevant and advances the state of the art.";0;vrn1gt;[]

Birds are very good at this, easy to train, and you can set up a self-reinforcing system by having three birds decide for each picture. Whenever there is a disagreement, you go with the majority, and reward the majority with a treat. That provides enough reinforcement to keep the recognition accurate.
You can even train new birds automatically, by having a system where they are paired with a group of already trained birds, and they are rewarded when they agree with the trained group.
B.F. Skinner did a successful demonstration during WWII of how pigeons could be trained to recognize ships and identify them as ours or the enemy's, and could be used to steer guided bombs to the enemy ships.
There was some work after the war into using pigeons to inspect parts on assembly lines. The birds were far more accurate than humans, as humans get tired and have trouble paying attention after hours of watching the same part come by. The birds worked all day, and their accuracy didn't fall off.
Ultimately, the tests were stopped, because the companies that participated thought the public would not understand. They feared the competitors would try to make it sound like using dumb birds to inspect the parts, instead of highly trained humans, meant low quality.
Still, its kind of funny to realize that Google could probably do a better job of automatically classifying things, such as uploaded images, by setting up a bird-based system. I wonder what PETA would think of it?

And I am willing to find out more about reversed causality as it could well be possible on a quantum physics-level.
But saying that the cause is a consequence of its own consequence(s) seems to be more of a circular causality than it is reversed causality. It would imply an infinite circle to represent time, which due to its physical constraints cannot be related to what we know as life and of anything considering our universe. I would love to read more about these experiments, if anyone has some links to experiments confirming the hypothesis?
The circular nature of time is an ancient (predominantly) Asian concept which shows quite some flaws in its architecture, as it represents lifecycles as well as passing eras or the birth/death of planets and stars. A more convenient representation would possibly be an infinite helix, not much different from our beta-helix DNA structure, but with an infinite level of possible strands, motives and feedback-loops. Not much unlike the multiverse idea, though strictly limited to just the dimension of time.

For instance, the Bohm interpretation of QM ascribes point-like particles a non-Newtonian motion dictated by the configuration space of the universe which evolves non-locally, ie. superluminally. This non-local interaction can violate Lorentz invariance which to observers can look like the future influencing the past.
So instead of inverting our notion of causality, we can solve this apparent dilemma by abandoning constraints which we thought applied but which really may not.

This is not to say that time is directional, but rather that it is one of the four perpendicular axes defining a four-space in which particles live. In fact, I don't think reverse causality is a particularly new idea. As soon as relativists realized what world lines were, there were questions about causality traveling at the speed of light both forward and backward in time since all of time was supposed to exist at once, and we just lacked the proper vehicle for traveling orthogonal to space.

They are performing 2 or 3 measurements in a row. If a result of second is bigger than expected, then it's the 3rd measurement interfering backwards in time with 2nd. Okay. What were the results of 2nd measurement when they *didn't* perform the third one? Thanks for asking, the results were *also bigger than expected*. The only difference was this: if they did perform 3rd, the results of 2nd are bigger because 3rd caused them to; if they didn't the results are bigger because of experimental error in apparatus or whatever.

EDIT: Just went and read the actual paper, and I *definitely* don't see reverse causality here. All I see is physicists discovering a new-ish quantum phenomenon (amplification of a perturbance through ""post-selection""), and that phenomenon has given them an avenue to use weak quantum measurements to greater effect. The measurements are coupled through time, but we already knew of quantum effects that are linked through time. These measurements cannot predict the future--shame on Discover for even implying it.

When you carry out a Bell measurement and see that for basis at 45 degrees, the projection always satisfies entanglement, you can be pretty sure that Einstein's view is wrong.

But the way I understand it is that the two particles are somehow intrinsically linked; it's not that one particle is communicating with the other in some way that implies a transmission of information faster than the speed of light, but rather the particles are moving at exactly the same moment, which suggests that they are connected in a way that does not need any physical transmission of data, which to me implies some other realm of connection that we perhaps don't know of yet. Some type of connection between particles (perhaps all particles?) that is a basic element of how the universe is made up, that we do not yet understand, and is more fundamental than our ideas of object A having to travel through space and time in order to communicate with object B.

This is a widespread misunderstanding of how entanglement works, and problematic because people infer that faster-than-light communication is possible.
Suppose Alice measures particle A and Bob measures particle B; particle A and B are entangled. They can make their measurements very fancy (like the experiment in OP's article) or very simple but what I say below remains unchanged.
From Bob's point of view, the *act* of Alice's measurement changes nothing about his expectation of probabilities when he makes his measurements. It does not matter even if he knows exactly what is her plan of measurement. **There is no way for Bob to detect which type of measurement Alice has made, or even if she has made a measurement at all.** Hence there is no detectable action at a distance. It is only later on, after both Alice and Bob have communicated their measurement results to each other and compared notes, that they notice there is a special type of correlation that is impossible in standard, classical physics. (And note I say correlation, not causation.)

1) I thought that the collapse of the wavefunction had to do with the discrete nature of energy. I mean: imagine that we set up the double slit experiment again. We send a one quantum energy wave against the slits. The wave goes through the slits and the interferences appear beyond the slits. Once the interfering 1 quantum wave hits the back detecting screen, it happens the following: since 1 quantum can't be subdivided into smaller quantities of energy, then that single quantum can't be subdivided so it affects several separated points of the detecting screen, so a smooth gradual spread pattern of diffraction can't appear, but the 1 quantum wave will only affect one random spot on the detecting screen. Wasn't this how the wave function ""collapse"" worked?
2) However the wave function manages to collapse, if it really collapses, then we get this other fact in our double slit experiment: once the wave collapses at a single spot of the measuring screen and so this spot enters the ""hit state"", then all the other points *logically* enter a ""not hit state"" in an instantaneous way. So doesn't it make it the functioning of the entanglement between the different points of the measuring screen a simple matter of ""logic"", which is why entanglement can work in an ""instantaneous"" way?

So for Einstein, who personally disbelieves all the advances of quantum mechanics being probabilistic in nature, of course the inevitable outcome of entanglement looks like ""spooky action"" and stuff breaking the laws of relativity he (among others) discovered.
The whole ""spooky action"" thing is really just Einstein's own personal views of quantum mechanics.

Even tho we've been playing around with quantum theories for years, I don't recall hearing about any tech that actually uses any of these properties, but that's because they haven't figured it all out yet, right?
Anybody else remember the double slit experiment that was supposed to retroactively yield a different result depending on whether or not someone watched a recording of it later?
I'm no quantum expert, but if someone says that something is in a ""superposition"", (indefinite state,) until you measure it, I think, ""well, how do you *know* what its doing if *you haven't measured it yet?*""
I think we're still buggering badgers here folks... There's some step or function the researchers are missing or making assumptions about that makes it seem like the quarks are breaking time/speed limits, but from what it sounds like, each half of the entangled sets are simply being attuned to a complimentary frequency. I can even illustrate what I'm talking about better than I've ever seen the supposed spooky action explained.
Take two disks, (wheels, chocolate chip cookies, whatever,) and put them on an axle. Now, mark each disk, one on top and one on bottom. Now spin the axle. No matter how far apart the disks are moved, if you don't interfere with their spin, or shift the axle you can hide one and whenever you stop the other you'll know exactly what position the other wheel is in. In the case of quantum particles the axle would be *time*, once your partcles are ""entangled"", (I'd say ""synchronized"" sounds more likely,) unless you induce an EM charge or particle bombardment or time dilation effect, your synchronised particles should behave exactly as described. Spinning in unison until something breaks the harmony.

could that somehow be related to the quantum entanglement stuff? like maybe that particle way over there eventually becomes a particle that's a part of me in the future, which is why noting my particles causes that one to instantly change. because it's eventually a part of me, or according to (my version of) the 4th dimension, it already is a part of me.

No two electrons of the same orbital can have the same spin. This means if you know the spin of one electron, you also know the spin of the other as it would be the exact opposite value. Given that orbitals aren't flat disks like what is taught in early science classes, and rather a balloon/ring/sphere-shaped probability densities (meaning the electron has a higher probability of being found in the aforementioned regions than elsewhere), the electron could theoretically be at the opposite end of the universe and still maintain its entanglement with its counterpart electron as it relates to their spins.
The shoe store example is akin to the Schrodinger's cat example where the spin is entirely unknown until observed. According to our understanding of quantum mechanics, the electrons are in a superposition of both spin directions until we observe which spin one of the electrons has.

The article's implied relationship between quantum teleportation and entanglement is a bit deceptive.
The which-shoe-did-you-leave-at-the-store analogy is a good one, but note that it doesn't allow you to transmit new information back to the store. E.g. if you later make a yes/no decision on whether to have fish for dinner, there's no way of using the process of discovering which shoe is in the box and which remains back at the store to transmit this decision back to the store.
Next, quantum teleportation doesn't use entanglement in this way. It uses vector bosons, e.g. photons, to reproduce the quantum state of one particle in another. These travel at the speed of light (for photons) or more slowly (other vector bosons which have mass) so the technique is important for implementing something like a quantum computer, which requires something like this to move information from place to place.
This is all pretty nifty, mind you, but I noticed in some replies people succumbing to the same confusion the science writer did. (The original article is clearer, sort of, but a lot more difficult to read.)
It's also worth noting that quantum entanglement *does* give us a noteworthy and useful gift: encryption. It can be used to transmit a crypto key from one place to another in a way which makes it immediately obvious that someone has eavesdropped on the key exchange.

As Eddington pointed out already before many years, gravitational waves do not have a unique speed of propagation. The speed of the alleged waves is coordinate dependent. A different set of coordinates yields a different speed of propagation and such waves would propagate like the noise.
Relativists use a simplified form of Einstein field equations to calculate various properties of his gravitational field, including Einstein gravitational waves, which are based on the Einstein's pseudo-tensor. This simplified form is called the linearised field equations. They do this because Einstein's field equations are highly non-linear (implicit actually) and impossible to solve analytically. So they use the linearized form, simply assuming that they can do so. However Hermann Weyl proved in 1944 already, that linearization of the field equations implies the existence of a Einstein's pseudo-tensor that doesn't otherwise exist.
The conceptual problem of gravitational waves definition is, the gravitational wave is formed with curvature of space-time and the position of artifacts in general relativity is defined only with respect to curvature of space-time (the flat space-time poses no reference frame for definition of location). In such way the position of gravitational wave is defined it's own position, which leads into circular reasoning of its existence.";0;kdlov;[]

Someone probably need to correct me on the finer points but the key thing of this paper is that they observe fairly directly, in real space, the wavefunctions of a macroscopic object (the quantum fluid).
But, you said, don't we already see quantum mechanics with naked eyes? The famous double-slit experiment of course. That's true, but it's not a macroscopic quantum state that you see. They're single photons. This here is a big deal because now you can see, *with naked eyes*, a wavefunction of a *big* object.
""Pics or it didn't happen"", you said. But they *do* have pics. It's in Fig.3 in their [paper]( ! They captured it with a CCD, a digital camera practically. That is almost like naked eyes. It also means that there are *videos*! Maybe with poor frame rate but if you can take pictures then you have videos.
So there you have it. If your mind still feels unsatisfied, wanting to be blown more readily, you could have a look at this [result]( , which is of similar point.
They basically managed to make a macroscopic piece of film stay absolutely still (~ absolute zero temperature), entangle it with a quantum state and arrive at a situation where that piece of film exists under a superimposed state of moving and not-moving.

It doesn't describe what the image shows, or how it was derived. So trolling the Googlenet, you come up with such joys as ""*Scotch eggheads take first-ever snap of quantum entanglement*"" (Scottish?).
Finally, [this]( from AAAS Science. > Here, we report an experiment demonstrating the violation of a Bell inequality within observed images. It is based on acquiring full-field coincidence images of a phase object probed by photons from an entangled pair source.
They generate two entangled photons, but sparsely, so these tend to arrive a pair at at time with a gap between them. They hit a beam splitter, which can do several things, but one of these is to reflect one of the two photons into another arm of the system and also to let the other one pass straight through it. The one that passes through is then filtered for its polarisation (sort of) and then hits a detector so sensitive that it reacts to a single photon. That event is signalled to a camera, which is staring down the other arm of the array. The second photon is, of course, passing along this arm. The whole thing is physically engineered so that the detector's signal to the camera and the arrival of this other photon will coincide: ker-snap. Before it gets there, however, this second photon has to pass through another (sort of) polariser. These sort-of-polarisers are objects which change a photon's phase. I won't unbundle this, but these constitute:
> a circular phase step and [...] a straight-edged phase step [which] are placed [individually] within separated optical arms, and [which] are probed by [the] two entangled photons. This setup would, if placed together in a single arm and with a single photon, produce an image in which the circular filter blocks out the pair of photons altogether by making them interfere with each other. This would generate an image of a black circle surrounded by dots from individual photons that missed it. The image is, of course, generated by many, many separate pairs of photons. This black circle is what you see in the photograph, except that the two filters are not in the same place, but are **physically separate and acting on two, entangled photons**. That is, entangled photons essentially ignore separation when something is done to one or the other of them,. There's a bit more to it, showing that Bell's Inequality, the standard test for entanglement, is indeed violated. This is complex, see Eq. 4 if you don't believe me.";0;cch4o7;[]

However, quantum computers are only superior for solving quantum algorithms since qubits can represent quantum states exponentially faster than a classic computer can ""simulate"" them. So the second aspect of this field is the discovery of quantum algorithms that can surpass ""classic"" ones. The most famous example is probably ""Shor's Algorithm"" which devised a quantum algorithm that could solve the math used in many types of encryption more efficiently than a classical algorithm. What it boils down to then is the following comparison:
Volume of information processed by a Quantum Computer multiplied by the time efficiency (called time complexity) of a Quantum Algorithm <VERSUS> Volume of information processed by a Classic Computer multiplied by the time efficiency of a Classic Algorithm.
Given the complexity and requirements behind a Quantum Computer, its real world application is completely dependent on the application of Quantum Algorithms. Where classic algorithms are already efficient (e.g. binary search), classic computers will likely reign supreme until the end of time. Furthermore, even where the Quantum Algorithm is clearly superior for a specific problem (Shor's Algorithm), we are still a long ways from a Quantum Computer that has enough Qubits to carry out the necessary calculations (one estimate suggests millions of qubits may be required due to error/noise correction).";0;dlz540;[]

Actually, they proved that their machine can more or less randomly change from one quantum state to another faster than a classical computer could simulate it more or less randomly changing from one quantum state to another.
I'll believe all this - And although difficult in practice the theory behind quantum computing is pretty sound - when they can factor a large number randomly chosen by someone else, then do the same thing again, then do the same thing again.
Oh, and that figure of 10K years? It looks like that's how long it would take a conventional machine to simulate the quantum machine *if programmed to do so the least efficient way possible*.

Everyone tries to make quantum entanglement sound like something amazing and completely takes it out of context. Instead of dealing with terms like spin and polarization lets just take it at a level everyone can understand. Assume your particles are baseballs, they are thrown exactly the same, they're considered entangled when they will react the same way to the same situation every time. They stop being entangled when something interferes with them, one of them has a wall placed 5 feet in front of it, when it hits the wall, it's not entangled anymore.
People seem to think entangled means that, if 2 baseballs are entangled on the ground and I pick one up the other magically floats upward to match which is just ridiculous. The point being, you cannot physically change one and instantly have the other change. The only entanglement is if NOTHING interferes with them in which case if nothing interferes with them they can be as far apart as they want and the way one acts is the same way the other acts because nothings messing up their entanglement.
In actuality this is VERY VERY useless. Science takes a lot of things how they weren't meant to be interpreted, like superposition for instance, lets say something only has 2 states, science says until you look at it and figure out which state it's in it's in both of the states at once. The idea behind this was to tell scientists not to make assumptions until they know, they took it literally though and turned it into a scientific principal.
How about another, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, you can't know where something is and where it's going at the same time, the fact that we can measure trajectories of objects disproves that. Yet another fail for science.
How about hawking radiation, NOTHING can escape a black hole, then hawking decides that something CAN escape which should be obviously false by the lack of matter in the universe.
How about the speed of light, can't escape a black hole which should only effect something with a mass and yet people think a photon has no mass. Not to mention people think it's the absolute maximum speed possible based SOLELY on no one observing anything faster. Everyone always tries to say it's not, but can never link an actual article showing otherwise.
We know that the light from distant stars takes a long time to reach us and what we are seeing when we look at it is what it looked like when it was sent towards us and not what it is now, meaning those stars you look at in the sky might not even be there anymore, especially when scientists use massive telescopes and use galaxies for their lensing effects. Yet somehow people believe that traveling faster than the speed of light actually takes you back in time and screws with causality when it's clear that all light does is transmit an image. and that if you could travel faster than light you couldn't effect time but you could see what happened back in time because you're viewing the image further back so long as the light isn't obstructed of course.
Pretty much the only phenomenon that's really amazing that science got right is time dilation.

The article says both diamonds act as if they're one object. What if entangled particles exist in a hypothetical fourth spatial dimension? Couldn't this give us the illusion of two separate objects behaving as one, when in reality it's one object that exists in a dimension we can't observe?
To use the flatland analogy, if I were to take a three-dimensional U shaped object, and place each leg of the U on flatland, the two dimensional observers would see two independent objects, not being aware of the third dimension. Depending on the circumstances, certain actions applied to one leg of the U might be reflected by the other leg.
The observers of flatland would be observing something very much like entanglement, I think.";0;mwole;[]

&#x200B;
Theory of mind essentially breaks this axiom outright.
&#x200B;
If the quantum state of a system is set before an observation is made, in which the ground state of the observer is inconsistent with the true nature of the system, then the observation will always be incongruent with the system.
&#x200B;
Case and point: &#x200B;
An unbiased jury, free from the knowledge of the case being tried, is essentially a twelve person quantum computer set to task of observing a system after the collapse of its quantum state. The evidence and facts of the case are weighed by each juror to quantify the implication it will have on their individual verdict. When the case is over and the jury goes into deliberation, the outcome is still in a super position of guilty/innocent regardless of the fact that the officers who arrested the individual believed there to be sufficient evidence for a guilty verdict.

Lets say you want to transmit a message over an extremely long distance, light years for example.
The message is a simple Boolean yes or no. One particle is sent with whomever is going to be at the destination, the other stays with you. (And yes, were talking spherical cows in a vacuum style hypothetical.)
So qubit A goes to get lost in space, qubit B stays home.
At some point, you want to send a message to qubit A. So you microwave qubit B until it has the proper orientation. Since A and B are entangled, A must also change to match the change in B, and this is done instantly, potentially far faster than the speed of light, depending on how far A and B are from each other.
So not only does this break the standard model (again hypothetically) but it also implies that the speed of light is not the limit for the transmission of any kind of information or state-change.

The idea is that a one-time pad needs to offer the same set of random numbers to two parties. Usually, you use classical means to deliver two copies of the same set of randomly generated bits.
You could instead deliver entangled atoms to two parties with an ordering. Then, to send a message over classical channels, you measure atoms as you need more random bits. The other party will measure their atoms (that are no longer in the same state superposition) when they receive the message to decode the transmitted message.

Quantum entanglement is critical in the design of quantum computers. Does this imply we could make a Quantom Computer that is stored in multiple, far away, locations? Not that this is desirable per say, but it's neat to think of a giant multi-part calculator that works at the same speed regardless of it's distances apart. Sure, our ability to read it however is sadly still limited by the speed of light (and trains and plains and automobiles), but the concept is super cool to me.
The only practical advantage I can think of is having a complex answer hidden behind the lack of remaining nodes of information. Nuke launch codes, or something so important a single person shouldn't be able to run it.

It blows my mind that you can make a (very simplified) quantum bit flip 20 miles apart, but it's 100% meaningless to the recipient until they are told to look for it. Changing something faster than the speed of light, but in a way that is only useful only at the speed of light.
I don't know if it's feasible to make the system in such a way as to have the recipient ready to know what to look for *before* the message is sent, but is expecting it. In my very limited knowledge this can't be feasible, unless the length limit of quantum entanglement is literally 1 lightyear or less. Otherwise we would be able to send messages to people on the other end of quantum ""phone"" faster than light could get there, so long as we literally went there first. That would be truly ground breaking.
I need to talk to a quantum physicist.

Edit:
My flawed assumption has been found. A quantum bit doesn't show a 1 or a 0. It shows a superposition of 1 through 0. The receiving end can't tell the difference between static noise, and the incoming data unless they have the ""senders"" measurements as well.";0;vu7s81;[]

This article is talking about the process used to connect the two atoms. And they did it with the two atoms being about 20 miles from each other.
But as I understand it, once the entanglement has been established, the two atoms can then transmit their state changes between each other over an unlimited distance at something greater than the speed of light.
So you can connect them at 20 miles apart, and then take one of them to the other side of the solar system, and they'll remain entangled and continue to react to changes on each other ""instantly"".
Is that right? Or am I missing something?";0;vu23ob;[]

The photons are then sent down the fiber optic cables to meet at a receiving station in the middle. There, the photons undergo a joint measurement, which entangles them and because theyre each already entangled with their own atom, the two atoms become entangled with each other as well.
The key is that the mediating photons were converted into a longer wavelength so that they travel further through the fibers
So, if I had an entangled pair set a distance apart, and an unentangled pair set a the distance apart, lasered em up until four photons were sent to the receiving station, Id end up with an entangled pair(1) and an unentangled pair(0). Well, thats some pretty useful information.";0;vu7s81;[]

You can't transmit meaningful information using entangled particles. If 2 people entangled 2 particles and separated by 100 light years, neither would even know when the other party observed their corresponding particle, if at all.

There is a good video on it here: [Minute Physics: Bell's Theorem: The Quantum Venn Diagram Paradox](
Entanglement is often measured with spin. If particle A spins up then the entangled particle B will spin down.
Our naive thought is that is that there is a hidden variable. For instance, when we first entangle A and B, A is actually Up, which causes B to spin Down and we don't find this out until we measure. So, it would be no more controversial or confusing than saying >Mike has a blue ball and a red ball. He puts one of the balls in the mail and it goes to Alpha Centari. Once it gets there, Mike shows us he has the red ball and now we instantly know the color of the ball in Alpha Centari.
If this was the case, there would be no spooky action and everything would make good logical sense.
This is what Bell's Theorem is about. It shows, through experimentation, that there is no set of hidden variables that explain the observed phenomena. Instead, the particles must have both states and they collapse when observed, but the entangled particles always collapse in pairs. This is actually a good reason why this belongs in a philosophy sub, because it was this logic argument that proved local realism was impossible.
So the particles aren't transferring a property forward through time, because they have no properties to transfer. They are instead creating a bridge that spans across time. The major thing that quantum physics brings to philosophy isn't the concept of the observer, but rather that quantum systems seem to violate the core rule of logic A/=~A. Particles have contradictory properties and display different factors of those contradictory properties based on how we measure them. So we, by choosing how to measure a value, can change it's properties.";0;9l1wd9;[]

There seems to be quite the discussion developing on the ""double slit"" experiment and other stuff about ""observers"" and ""consciousness"". There is no mystery or deep philosophical problem here. First lets straighten out the ""entanglement"" misconceptions. Entanglement is a bad word to describe what is happening here. Entanglement refers to the correlations between particles that cannot be described using classical probability. For instance if you decided to use classical probability to work out the odds of two particles being polarised in the same way upon detection then you would use the permutation formula in probability. Doing this you can calculate probabilities for all possible permuations for both particles to be polarised relative to a specific angle. And suppose for the sake of argument that the maximum value for the probability you can get in the set of all permuations is 2/3. Now if you use quantum mechanics to work out the probabilities and suppose again for the sake of argument the maximum value possible for the probability of 2 particles to be correlated relative to a specific polarisation angle is 3/4. So by using quantum mechanics you get probabilities for correlations between particles that cannot be accounted for using classical probability. It is these extra correlations that have come to be known as entanglement. But wait! One way of calculating the probabilities must be wrong? Which is it? Classical or Quantum? It's quantum as it has been experimentally verified several times now using the Bell test. And the simple truth is it does not matter whether it is spatial or temporal. They're just a probability for the particles to be correlated in some way.
&#x200B;
Now the double slit experiment. I actually posted this before on the eli5 for the double split experiment but it was largely ignored so I'll post it again here in the hopes that it will clear up all the misconceptions about ""observers\* and ""the act of observation"" and all that vague stuff that really can't be defined properly and to be honest has no place in a rigorous scientific setting. So with the double slit experiment whats actually happening is a consequence of not being able to measure precisely where the particle is. This comes from there being an uncertainty in the position of predicting where the particle will land. Also the interference pattern does not appear immediately. It builds up over time. To see this you slow down the light so it arrives at the screen 1 photon at a time. After the first few photons are detected it looks like a random pattern. But then as time evolves and more and more photons are detected it looks like they are making up a banding-like pattern on the screen. In some bands there are hardly any marks. In other bands there are loads of marks. And the number of marks in each band seems symmetrical around a centerline. Physicists (and mathematicans) have a word for this. Its called a probability distribution. Whenever you have a bunch of stuff in a space you can order them according to some property of the stuff. The most familiar one is the normal distribution. Thats that bell shaped curve thing. Say you're marking an exam out of 100 and you want to make a plot where the x axis is 1,2,3,.,98,99,100 and the y axis is the number of students. You start to plot. 2 students get 3 marks, 5 students get 10 marks, 15 students get 40 marks, 40 students get 50 marks ,60 students get 65 marks, 20 students get 80 marks, 4 sutdents get 90 marks, 1 student got 100 marks. Then youll find that the Bell shaped curve starts to emerge. And curves are funny things as theres always an equation that will let you draw the curve smoothly (unless its not differentiable, but never mind that for now). So the equation for the Bell shaped curve is Y=e\^(x\^2). That e is the exponential function and those hats mean to the power of. Now lets return to photons that left marks on the screen in the pattern of bands. So you can do somthing similar to what we did for the plot with the number of students and the marks they got. This time on the y axis instead of the number of students its the number of marks on the screen (which is a measure of light intensity) and on the x axis its distance measured from the half way point between the slits (moving right along the screen is +x , left is -x). So if we plot the number of photons at differrent distances a sort of wave like pattern appears. It likes look a series of hills and troughs with the height of each hill and the depth of each trough increasing as you get towards the point where x=0. This is the probability distribution for the location of the photon on the detector screen after it has left (scatters off) the double slit. Like the bell shaped curve it too has an equation which is y=cos\^2(gamma)sin\^2(alpha)/alpha\^2 where the alphas and gammas are angles related to where you are on the x axis. And that equation is also the same equation you get when you take 2 waves (where one wave is out of step with the other wave) and calculate the ratio of the amplitudes of both waves. So basically the probability distribution for where the photon will end up on the sceen has the same mathematical expression as the amplitudes of of 2 waves out of step divided by each other. So when its one photon at a time the interference pattern slowly builds up with the location of the photons following the probabilty distribution I just described. Now speed up the process so its millions of photons at a time. The intensity now is much greater but the photons still follow the same probabilty distribution as before except that it builds up so quickly (due to the miiilions of photons per second) that on the screen it looks like an interference pattern has just appeared there presumably from two waves interfering. But its actually photons following a probability distribution function for location that is similar to the function used to describe the ratio of amplitudes in the wave interference of 2 waves. And the reason you have this probability distribution is you cannot measure the location of the photon without losing information on a conjugate variable such as momentum. In fact it was recently shown that the so called wave particle duality is equivalent to a special type of uncertainty relation called an entropic uncertainty relation. []( And if you want a bit of deeper dive whilst keeping almost ELI5 check out the first 3 chapters of Feynmans Lectures volume 3 [\_01.html]( And to answer your ""observe"" question that's when a photon is detected on the screen. It leaves a mark/signal and so is ""observed""

Also there are quite a few of these ""interpretations"" of quantum mechanics the ""many worlds"" one being quite popular and the ""Copenhagen"" interpretation also being a favourite among many physicists. But all these things are just exercises in futility.

In short, the experiment also generates a particle pair and lets these take their own paths through different sections of the setup. Results show that the path that particle A takes in its own section is correlated in a specific way to the path particle B ends up taking. The catch is that B's path would seem to be determined after particle A has already been measured. If B's path causes A's path to change, the future has impacted the past. The setup also seems to exclude A's path causing B's path to change as it would lead to other bizarre conclusions, like requiring that the entire setup is ""known"" to A.

All that we do, all the changes we do for the better, increases our consciousness.
You dont have to sit on a mountain top for this.
As soon as you realise you where always enlightened, work towards a better future for this dream, because you will always come back, change yourself = change the future.
Since youve already read this far, love is what we are basically, if we dont tend to it, we lose it.
We lose the love thats in our heart, because we are either narcissistic or not caring enough of ourself.
Everything is a balance act, dont go 100 % spirituality, dont do 100 % life. This intertwine as the being we are.
I am, and so are you!
We have always been, and will always be.
The more conscious you become, the more clear all the possibilities of information, and perspectives will be. Because we all do have different perspectives on the world, and its up to us to be open to each others differences to actually learn something - dont be fooled by what you see, act from whats inside your heart.
Its now or never!!

Verse 15) The first reality before time was God, but only God was there at the beginning. The Word of God was God from the beginning. To create the environment for all existence, an excellent and robust structure was necessary. To demonstrate proportionality between the Creator and creation the control of that structure was given to the preincarnate Christ who made all things. In the beginning of time, was the infinity of time but this sovereign simplicity was concealed so that a certain delineation of time might be perceived by all creation through the expansion in the fabric of Spacetime. Every physical property was made obedience to the creator as moving forward in single four-dimensional continuum. This spacetime is closely associated with Jesus who holds everything together (The Word of God). Logos introduced by the Greek philosophers and derived from the Greek language can be view as more than just the expression Word (r/, 2015). In the original Greek the meaning of Logos was intrinsic to the Greek philosophers because it represented to their audience the supportive evidence to their logical structure. The Greek people wanted to only apply reason to Gods grace and thought the message of the Cross was foolishness. During Christs ministry to his Jewish brotherhood was such a robust and excellent augment established for mankinds inadequacy to earn Gods approval due to the overwhelming desire for peer praise. Nevertheless, the Pharisee of that time where necessary to frustrate the message of Grace so that prophesy would be fulfilled (Moses). The seven woes were the last address Jesus gave to a mixed public audience (Matthew). In the effectiveness of omnipresence, God clearly explains the results that will occur to a disobedient generation which research and know the mind of God without surrendering to His whole will. This exposure to the truth invites intellectual pride and hubris because without combining knowledge with faith we cannot discern divine-spiritual truths.
For when the hostility between God and His redeemed was validated by the sacrificial act of Christ on the cross, Paradise was opened. This was made possible by Jesus Christ who after scorning the shame of mankinds sin the dividing curtain from holiness was sheared from top to bottom. By this one-time act of Logos was the summation of Christs mortality as the Son of Man was not overshadowed by His eternal Name above all names. Consequently, there is presently only one Heavenly Priest and King sitting at Gods right hand preparing an expanding Kingdom of both Jews and Gentiles to become ""permanent"" citizens of His house for eternity. Because of the awakening of mankinds awareness to the Gentiles opportunity for salvation, the Jews and the Greeks introduces heresies as to add adherence to Gods Logos. For the Jews realized after the apostle Peters sermon at Pentecost that there was an additional moment of time to receive the Spirit of God and avoid damnation. But for the Gentiles this became evident in the same book of Acts by the story of Pauls Road to Damascus . In modern terms it might be used as a persuasive technique in writing or rhetoric to give an audience context to the individuals own creative thinking. Unfortunate for humanity, false Christs are the structured-appeal to take captive our comprehension for self-interest sake so that we achieve an allusion of salvation counter to the properties of God. More than likely, the human bent is distorted by another voice of reason with promises that appeal to our own weak sin nature. This contradictory message away from the truth is due to the sin nature becoming dominate in our modern age. This human logos or false Christ is anything counter-intuitive to Gods own self-interest (Logos) as to render the human logos a pathway to unholiness, sin, and finally the ultimate death. The majestic countdown clock from a mortal perspective was activated and there was light. For God so loved mankind as to prepare six iterations of time marked with a seventh reiteration of time. A seventh state of existence in which time over time is made manifest to reveal Gods good will. His will was to create a period of rest in which to prepare His bride who would first suffer sins dominate power before a stage of repentance. Therefore, the awakening.
This temporary rest, which was caused by death was not the final state of rest because mankind is predestined to live again. From the eternal viewpoint of God, the consequences sin is death but for the glory of God, mankind sins where not beyond the Grace of God. At just the right time Jesus Christ being God conquered the consequences of sin at the Cross by shedding His blood to redeem the whole Israel once and for all as His bride. Therefore, God has pre-established a solution for the final rest for His eternal heavenly family through a personal relationship with the faith that is found in Jesus Christ. All others who have lived without this saving faith fall short of the gift of Gods grace. For the love of Jesus Christ and Gods sacrificial act of redemptive love has been rejected along with the blaspheming the Holy Spirit. This type do not have their name written into the book of life. Plainly stated is that the varying velocity of Gods will be done is a fallacy embraced by mankind because we can only have reference relative to our viewpoint. God is not slow to act, although this may not be easily accepted from a human perspective, because that sovereign will be a supreme power under divide guidance. What if Gods prerogative was to permit another slave axis within its own domain as an expression of sternness from the Master to the slave. Imagine this obfuscation of the universes design perplexed the darkest which enabled evils predestined existence to live in duplicity with the objects of loving-light. Neither angel or man these powers and principalities rejected Gods Spirit and try to replace the exclusive right to fill mankinds conscience like the carbon monoxide molecule fills the red blood cell instead of the oxygen. We only wish to understand logos, but without Logos, everyone fall short of God's glory.";0;9l1wd9;[]

&#x200B;
As a few people have pointed out I did not explain the second part of the double slit experiment. So here goes. In every experiment that has been carried out where the experimenter tries to determine which slit the photon passes through the interference that is already present on the screen is disrupted and the pattern that emerges is more like a smudging of particle detections spread out symmetrically from the center line of the detector screen with more particle detections closer to the centerline. In the case of the quantum eraser experiments as the photon continues along its path after the path has been determined another optical element takes away the which path information and as if by magic the interference pattern (multiple bands) reappears. So what the hell is going on then? How can that happen? Like I said at the beginning of my original comment all of this (wave-particle duality, where did the inteference patten go?, quantum eraser, observation) are all consequences of the uncertainty relationships (basically not being able to measure precisely where the particle is).
&#x200B;
Lets clear up whats happening when people talk about observing in relation to the double slit experiment. Bohr provided the solution to why the interference pattern disapperars when the experimenter attempts to probe the experiment and determine which slit the photon went through (This was during the Bohr-Einstein debates, possibly the reddit of its day, years and years ago, although back then it was called The Solvay conferences :D). So back to the explaination. In order to detect which slit the photon goes through any sort of device (microscope, laser, another much smaller detector screen, etc) must by its very nature use another particle to gain information about the photon. This other particle will impart whats called a momentum kick. Its like when youre playing pool (aka billards) or snooker and the white ball hits another colored ball. The white ball (depending on the initial conditions and they can be adjusted to get the desired result) will stop thus indicating some information about the other ball such as location or velocity. However a consequence of hitting that coloured ball is that its momentum has now changed. This is basically a momentum kick and something quite similar happens with the photons and the probing particle. Now it turns out (and this has been verified experimenatlly over and over by many different experiments) that the least amount of momentum required by the probing particle to obtain sufficient information to definintely say which slit it went through exceeds the limit defined in the uncertainty relationship for keeping the interfreence pattern intact or coherent.
&#x200B;
What is this uncertainty relationship? Well this is it. \[ deltaP x deltaQ > or = 0.5 hbar \]. Now ""deltaP"" is the uncertainty in momentum and ""delatQ"" is the uncertainty in position (the deltas mean really really small). hbar is also a really really small number (Plancks constant divided by 2pie). What the uncertainty relation is saying is, that if you multiply the uncertainties in postion and momentum by each other for the photon that you want to obtain information from, as long as the uncertainties when multiplied togteher are bigger than 0.5 times hbar, then the interference pattern will remain intact. However, the least amount of momentum for the probing particle you can use to get a sensible answer for the location of the photon changes the uncertainty in momentum by an amount such that on multiplying by the unceratinty in position the number that should be bigger than 0.5 times hbar for the interference pattern to remain intact now becomes smaller than 0.5 hbar and so the interference pattern is disrupted. But wait? What happend to the probabilty distributions I was taliking about earlier that define the interence pattern. Well another name for those uncertainties is standard deviation and the standard deviation is all you need to know to compare different probabilty distributions. The interference pattern is the probabilty distribution for the location. However it is connected to the probability distribution for the momentum by way of the uncertainty relation so a change in the momentum probability distribution will affect the location probability distribution. In the case of the probing particle the change is enough to affect the coherencnce of both distributions (deltaP X deltaQ < 0.5 hbar) and disrupt the interference pattern in both. And that is why the interference pattern turns into a smudge.
&#x200B;
But how does the interference pattern come back in those quantum erasure experiments? Well to answer that we need to know about the work of Berge Englert. He came to realise that in these double slit wave particle situations you can define quantities specifcally for the wave (interference) part and the particle (which way) part all derived from the uncertainty relations. Essentially he found you could define the wave interference by whats called the phase of the wave (the phase is a number that tells you how much out of step the two waves are in relation to each other). He called this quantity V for the visibility of the interference bands. Now for the particle part they used a measure of intensity which is the number of particles hitting the screen according to the location proabability distribution. He called this quantity D for path distinguishability. And then he found another inequality that related D and V. So there was a limit on how much of D you could have in relation to V. And that relationship is this D\^2 + V\^2 < or = 1.
&#x200B;
Now if this looks a bit frightening let me put your mind at rest. Remember Pythagoruss theorem? X\^2 + Y\^2 = Z\^2 for one of those 90 degree triangles. Its the same thing with D\^2 + V\^2 =1. Well now imagine a circle with a radius thats just the number 1. For the sake of simplicty imagine a line drawn along the radius from the center so that it crosse the circle boundary. kinda like this (\\ ). Now if you drop a vertical line from where the radius line crosses the circumference like this (|\\ then you have another right angled triangle |\_\\ where D\^2 + V\^2=1. (D is the horizontal line and V is the vertical line). Now depending on the angle of the radius ,D < V, D= V or D>V or D=1 and V=0 or D=0 and V=1. So guess what? That D=0 and V=1 case describes the situation where you get the interference pattern, the D=1 and V=0 case describes the situation with the smudged intensity pattern and the other ones describe intermdeiate situations where there is partial interference and partial smuding which has also been observed in countless experiements. The quantum erasure sitaution corresponds to a half rotaion of the circle defined by that D, V inequality. The rotation is achieved using the optical elements in the quantum erasure interferometer set up.
&#x200B;
Also a quarter rotation of the circle corresponds to the interference pattern transitioning to the smudge intensity pattern. Now this shows that there is no collapse of the wavefunction. By adjusting the set up the probability distribution for location of the photon transitions to a different probability distribution for location. That smudged out pattern is actually two slightly overlapping Bell shaped distributions but its still a probabilty distribution which means there is no so called collapse. There is no observation either. Yes a particle is used to indicate where the photon was but this actually changes the probability distribution for where the particle is going end up. So while some information is gained about where the photon was it has no influence on where it will eventually be detected on the screen. The ""collapse of the wave function"" is an interpretation of what could be happening much like the many worlds, etc. But they are just interpretations. And do not represent what is predicted by quantum mechanics. Also while there is no ""collapse of the wave function"" there is a process that occurs when an excited state in a 2 level system interacts with the Environment often modelled as the infinite sum of harmonic field modes. The excited state will lose energy in the form of a photon to one of the Environment's field modes thereby decaying into the ground state. This may have been confused with wave function collapse. Pure states will also decohere to a mixed state over time meaning the off diagonal elements known as coherences will vanish leaving the density matrix in the form of a classical probability distribution. This may also have been misinterpreted as wave function collapse.
&#x200B;
Now the delayed choice quantum eraser. The entangled photons mean that there are now two of those circles (representing both photons) like I described in the last paragraph. So with one circle you have (D1, V1)=(0,1) which is the interference pattern and in the other circle you have (D2,V2)=(1,0) which is the smudged out pattern. So the entanglement means the 2 two type of patterrns (interference and smudged) are correlated and theres a particular probability for that correlation. And depending on the way you can adjust parameters in the optical set up using the different branches on the multiple interforemters in the experiment the (D1, V1)=(cos(theta1), sin(theta1)) and (D2, V2)=(cos(theta2), sin(theta2)) become correlated according to the relative angle (theta1-theta2) thereby showing that there is a range of probabilities for correlated interference patterns (including partial and full) to occur depending on which photons are detected.

The main takeaway is that the cooling part of a quantum computer, which comprises the most of the building blocks and is an obstacle to mass production, can be possible be left out.
Takeaway:
Pros: possible quantum computers at room temperature, possible more states / redundancy in a single qubit for input. Possible a way towards error-free qubits with a magnitude less error-prone qubits for input. No cooling means it could theoretically be even better than classical computers for some low energy computations. Cons: none stated i could identify but there are probably some, otherwise this would alteady be a thing. Cons like Measurement of qubits are hard or Applying Pauli-Matrices is still in development or state decay is more rapid than with other quantum computer variants. Something along those lines. The article also said that they just started doing it and they hired this PhD Xi to help them. IMO they have an idea what it should be like and are now trying to build it. Still nothing which is usable. Maybe will be in some years with exactly what was written here.

I'm actually taking a class on the mathematics of quantum computing and this basically means nothing. Congratulations, you sent 9 qubits across a gate or something, this tells us basically nothing about how this system actually works - especially since they ignored relativity, which is like half of the problem with quantum gravity and wormholes and blackholes and stuff.
Furthermore, we don't even know if a wormhole exists in nature, afaik none have actually been discovered. I'm sure this researcher is doing legitimate work and there's actually something more to this, but science journalists are notorious for oversimplifying or not understanding things in order to push out some clickbait title.";0;z9lzyk;[]

Basically you need to know what a doppler shift is: ie. if you bounce light off something that's coming towards you, the frequency of the light coming towards you is shifted up, and if its going away from you, the frequency is shifted down.
In general when you have an object undergoing a motion described classically (tracing out some path) about a central position, it spends equal amounts of time going away from you as it does coming towards you (or else, it would be moving on average in a certain direction). So you'd expect the amount of light reflecting off of it which is doppler shifted to higher and lower frequencies to be exactly equal. When the object is cooled in its ``classical ground state'', it stops moving completely, so light reflecting off of it is neither shifted up, nor down in frequency. (there is of course nothing called a classical ground state, because a classical ground state would imply its position would be fixed, and its speed would be 0. this contradicts Heisenberg's uncertainty relation that states the speed and position of an object can't be well-known simultaneously.)
The ``quantum ground state'' is odd however, in that the object is then undergoing a motion which has no average direction to it, but can never lose energy to its environment (or light reflecting off of it). To shift the frequency of light up, one requires energy, and so less light is up shifted than down shifted. This is the asymmetry we set out to measure. The effect is distinctively nonclassical. By cooling the object to an average occupancy of around 2.5 phonons, we made the resonator cold enough that it spends roughly 30% of its time in quantum ground state, which is why we can observe this asymmetry.";0;p0iie;[]

That is true about software at a high level, but quantum communications are not built on traditional software - they are able to exploit a form of information transfer that is not based on the classical computing paradigm of binary information, so the same high level software principles do not apply. To use a quantum computer to communicate, you create a system of (usually two) connected (entangled) sub-atomic particles. I think most places use hydrogen atoms. The information is encoded in the electron of the hydrogen atom, which can have two possible states, and can be in either state simultaneously until it is measured. Once you take the measurement, the combined state collapses into one of the two possible states. When you measure one, it collapses both states. You can therefore alter the state of one, and have your partner measure the other to transmit information. If someone tries to intercept the message, your partner will see that the stare has already been measured when he receives it. This will alert both parties that someone is spying. This is one of two ways the system is unhackable The other way is due to the fact that the system itself is comprised of entangled hydrogen atoms. Since you can transfer information in this quantum way, the entire system can be classically analog. Most of our missiles are analog so they cant be hacked remotely. This would make the system unhackable in the sense that it cannot be done remotely, which is probably perfectly sufficient for the DOD Tl;dr- I am a quantum physics student. Actually... it is unhackable";0;hx77f6;[]

It was a time of perspective investment in new storage format, but then there were literally few consumer ready devices that could work with that new storage format, and their cost was described as ""few thousand dollars"" too.

That means that a *pure* quantum computer wouldnt be able to do most stuff a normal general-purpose computer can; it can do specific things (e.g., Shors Algorithm to factor numbers) much faster than a conventional computer. QC algorithms (usually) also give you an answer with some probability of that answer being correct, so youll have to repeat that algorithm an arbitrary number of times until youre reasonably sure youve got the right answer, though its not certain. In contrast, although a general-purpose computer can run probabilistic algorithms that work this way (e.g., this number probably isnt prime), most algorithms give you an answer that, assuming everythings programmed and functioning properly, is definitely right.
What this all means is that youre not going to have a quantum computer just lying around running Windows; the QC part of the machine is going to be attached as an accelerator chip/card/peripheral, like you would with a GPU, or *maybe* as a one-off extension to the CPU like the RNG that drives x86 RDRAND instructions. (The extra-instruction approach is unlikely IMO due to the fact that information on the quantum side of things would have to be collapsed in order to shuffle it over to the CPU, which means its state is near-totally separate from the normal CPU state except when taking input or giving final output.) If QC is done via accelerator, the CPU would line stuff up in RAM and poke the QPU, which would then use that to come up with a possible-answer, shove it back into RAM, and poke the CPU when done. The CPU itself isnt any faster, and neither is running anything not specifically targeted to the QPU. Moreover, different algorithms would get different kinds of speedup depending on how and how much they use the QPU.
In short, comparing the speed of a general-purpose+QC beast vs. a normal computer is like comparing apples and shoes-per-second unless you have a very specific algorithm and implementation in mind.";0;5xt03g;[]

Maybe in synthetic benchmarks, but just like with ""regular"" computers today, the software is holding back the hardware. We have amazing CPUs with a dozen or so cores and twice as many threads, and what happens? Lazy programmers use *one* core and then burden the system down with bloated code, have no respect for RAM and ultimately make a brand spanking new computer barely any faster than one from years ago. With IBM's new computer, similar things will happen. Incompetent developers won't optimize their software and thus greatly limit what the hardware should allow. ";0;5xt03g;[]

A 50 qbit device wil not be ""milliosn fo times faster"" than anything classical, and we have no idea how to write algorithms to make use of it even if it works. I'm not running down what is undoubtedly a technical tour de force, but people misunderstand quantum computing. First, we don't even know if the principle works or not. If it does, what it *does not* do is ""run many calculations in parallel"". It is designed so that the wave functions of solutions that are not correct interfere and so are not realised, whilst those which are nearly or actually correct are interfere constructively and collapse to an answer. There are very few algorithms that can do this, and they are intensely specific. Factoring of primes is an example of this. There is no sense in which quantum computers are capable of general computing, or can be organised into logic gates. John Preskil came up with the idea of ""quantum supremacy"" in 2011. This refers to the possibility of a demostrable quantum computing solution that classical computing cannot match. The demonstration would cast doubt on one of the foundational tenets of computer science, the Extended [Church-Turing Thesis]( - that computability is limited to a specific class of problem. To date, no ""supremacy"" has been shown. Indeed, as I understand it, the computations that emerge from ""quantum"" computers can equally be understood as classical shuttings about. That's not to say that QC may not one day work. But what that ""working"" entails may be far more narrow that the enthusiasts are inclined to claim. ";0;5xt03g;[]

The point is to send data from A to B and 100% confident that the data has not been read by someone else (C for example). Data not read by C would mean a pair of photons would be still be entangled. If C read it before it reaches B, then B would receive a photon that is already disentangled and B will know that the communication channel has been compromised.
At present, quantum communication is used for sending encryption keys only. These keys are used to encrypt the highspeed data over regular networks. So that means A and B actually send most data via our beloved internet/intranet, after they have negotiated encryption keys over secure quantum channel.
The whole reasoning here is that if you require the most secure communication, you may have to step away from TLS and TLS-related crypto libraries (i.e. OpenSSL) that may have been backdoored.
The news today is akin to making a network switch that doesn't alter the entanglement of the photons and can still route via the right fiber cable to the destination. Imagine A, B, C, D, E, F need to talk to each other. Without the switch, everyone will need to have 5 fiber cables. However, with such a switch, everyone will need only 1 fiber cable.";0;n7lzoe;[]

It is on the border of my understanding of QM, but, afaik, all what you get from measuring an entangled property is knowledge that the other particle has to have the opposite property, which is not enough to transfer information. It still can have military applications, though. For example, to randomly choose actors that execute different parts of a prepared in advance plan (so that your adversary has no way of knowing which unit will attack them): imagine you have a set of two identical envelopes on two different submarines and they choose which envelope to open (and, therefore, which instructions to execute) by measuring an entangled property.;0;n7lzoe;[]

Instead they have a rough blueprint for each molecule and can make educated predictions whether they will form bonds, combust, etc.

Essentially, they use a neural network as an ansatz for a quantum many-body wave function instead of more tradiational anstze that have been used in theoretical chemistry since the birth of the field. The training of the network then amounts to what is traditionally called a Quantum Monte Carlo calculation, since it involves an optimization of the wavefunction (usually by minimizing the energy of the ground state of the system). Many groups have been working on such approaches for years now. The new aspect is that this group proposes a neural network architecture that explicitly incorporates the fundamental antisymmetry of the many-electron wave function (as demanded by the Pauli principle). Non-network anstze have been incorporating that since the birth of quantum mechanics, but how to best implement it in a network-based wave function such that it does not spoil the desired efficiency improvements of such an ansatz is active research. The PauliNet proposed by the authors of the original paper is one possible solution.;0;kp4lil;[]

Just microwave photons, which is great and all but were these photons themselves entangled? Or did they simply pulse the beam of photons to create this oscillation? If that's the case, why wouldn't they just have photon readers and skip the middle step, I guess it gives a neat observable outcome. That being said it would be a big improvement on quantum computing that we have today. Giant cooling facilities to run these machines and such. With a more tangible way to read the outcomes, and hopefully easier to replicate process, it would probably cut down on the cost of quantum computing.

As a subtle point, the entanglement is not really generated between two massive objects, rather between two microscopic properties of two macroscopic objects. Explicitly, these drums vibrate, and their vibration is thousands of times smaller than the drums themselves. It's the vibrations that are entangled.

I think I saw one other person mention that computers operate completely based on logic gates.. I don't think I saw anyone else mention that computing is still based on eletromagnetism.
There is no sorcery going on here that makes the quibit 1 and 0 at the same time. The bit is simply held in a neutral state until the computer needs it to be a 1 or a 0, instead of functioning like a switch that is either on or off like a transistor.
What does this mean for computing? Exponential calculations will be far easier, but classical computing will largely not change, nor can it change.
Most if not all of our logic gates rely on a bit being set to either 1 or a 0, and we have millions and millions of them, versus a handful of quibits.

What follows is not complete, orthodox or probably very true, but it serve to show how off-beam many worlds has to be. Why does a particle trace a straight line in a cloud chamber? If it's a 'go everywhere, I'm all fuzzy' entity, it should not trace an invariably straight course, respond predictably to magnets and so on. Feynman suggested that the only course that did not have an equal and opposite parallel for it was a straight line: all the other pairs cancelled themselves out. Others said that in order to leave a track, the particle must be decohering as it interacts with the cold gas in the chamber, and so behaves deterministically. But what of light in a vacuum, always going straight, of course pace gravity?
The notion that answers these problems and which still gives you de Broglie and Heisenberg is that our universe is a ""hologram"". That doesn't mean a whisp of light^* , but a low dimension projection of a higher dimension reality. What's that mean? Well, you need four dimensions - that is, four independent numbers, expressed as co-ordinates - in order to locate a point or particle in time. So we talk about our world as being four dimensional. However, if you want to define the momentum of that particle - where its going and how fast - you need another three numbers. So, actually a seven dimension universe, as abstract points do not do anything, that is, exist. Then there's the various fields, such as charge, spin and so on. So where do they live? If particles are excitations of one or more fields, which is fundamental and where - in what dimensions - do they individually live?
Just after the Big Bang, we believe that there were no particles, just very high energy levels (somehow expressed) and fields. As the spacial and time-like fields (our 4D universe) expanded, energy levels dropped - and space became big enough - for particles to drop into existence. So, fields came before particles; indeed, 'before' or co-eval with space-time. So far as we know, fields cannot be split, changed and are immutable. In our hologram, our subset of the universe, combinations fields drop out as particles: the magnetic and electrostatic field drop out as the photon, for example. The photon is there (four numbers having a restricted number of values) and has more or less this momentum (three numbers, again with probabilities that sum to unity under proper manipulation.) Individual particles combinations - a spinning, electrically charged particle, say - to have properties when considered against other fields, such as space or time. As the particles are just epiphenomena of deeper stuff, this is hardly a surprise. Everett is ""about"" decoherence - what happens when a quantum situation makes up its mind. He says that it never does so, so you get endlessly proliferating universes. (But where's the energy?) But what is decoherence? In another view, it's something, probably something deterministic, that is happening in this much more complex space of which we live in a subset. Or, much more fun, is that you have two or more subsets of this higher structure. Each defines the behaviour of the other. Nothing is then ""fundamental"", and exists because the agency of the other structures define it. Decoherence is simply connecting the dots, between out bit of this structure and the others. Indeed, there are sensible theories that suggest that space if not time is derived from quantum entanglement - coherence - and its breakdown. ^* Look up the Maldecena conjecture if you want more on this.";0;dlvjor;[]

The math of multiple universes existing simultaneously is purely speculative and breaks down. I am no quantum theorist but based on my reading of Unger/Smolin the scientist quoting that the math makes it possible is taking some big leaps. The alternative, that I find more compelling as an argument, is that there are likely multiple universes, but they occur in succession. Evolving and changing over time. This is supported by the fact that we know certain static laws of the universe (gravity, weak/strong nuclear) existed in different forms than they do know moments after the big bang. They evolved. They changed. It's a fun thought excercise to imagine multiple universal yous, but personally I think it subtracts from the message of the genuine power of the moment here and now.;0;dlvjor;[]

I don't think a particles super position causes a new universe because it would then need this particles, which would have to be the first in its new universe to be the one to create a new universe and imprint all the position of all the previous particles across the whole universe instantly. How does thins new universe get it's information from the last one if the particles position is what causes the new universe. We've found quantum tunneling and pairity changes still happen at the speed of light so a particle creating a new universe would have to copy all the information from the entire universe instantly to the new universe. More likely particles in superposition do not experience time, like a photon doesn't experience time, it is instantly at its destination from it's frame of reference. A particle going through a double spit goes in all possible directions because a particle in motion isn't like a bowling ball that flies straight, it's more like throwing a balloon, it's unbalanced energy can make it go it a number of places so it does go in all directions all at once because it experiences all of the possibilities at the same time. Once you've measured it you've defined it's possibilities and so the particles can't go in every direction any more since you're measurements influenced the wave function.;0;dlvjor;[]

I think in the end all those infinite possibilities (or at least 99% of them) are going to be virtual in nature, sort of like those virtual particles which flash in and out of existence all the time in space. Those virtual particles can read as real momentarily; but then vanish back to whence they came. The other worlds are probably mostly like that too, with the exception being that when the wave function collapses on a particular instant, a MINIMUM number of probable futures are brought into being (the 'winners') creating only a handful of different realities, rather than zillions at every instance. And most of these sooner or later collapse back again to rejoin the original reality at a convenient point (since all these sibling universes tend to be closely related from the beginning anyway, and so can remerge again later). Most of these remerge very quickly; like within seconds or hours at most. Very few alternate timelines last lots longer than that.
Yes, over time (billions of years) this could still result in quite a lot of alternate realities, some of them diverging quite a bit from the original; but nowhere near as many or varied as a more open ended interpretation would suggest. And so would be far less taxing for the cosmos to create and manage.
There might even be a way that relatively 'old' and well developed alternate universes can eventually remerge again at some point, either somewhat sedately, or somewhat catastrophically; and the inhabitants of one or both either simply cease to exist in an instant, or somehow all awareness of any survivors (including physical evidence) automatically adjusts so as to make it impossible to tell that such a remerger ever took place.

It interpret the universe as deterministic thus have a hard time explaining the randomness observed. Attempts to derive the Born rule quickly makes its simplicity and elegance disappear. Which is the what make it appealing in the first place.
Personally I'm almost certain it is incorrect. MWI interpret the observed randomness by self-locating probabilities. E.g. even though it is certain a coin toss would split the world into two, where both head and tail happens, it is still unknown which world 'I' am in, thus the observed randomness. This kind of self-locating probabilities use principle of indifference while dealing with the two worlds yet take a special interest in the being of 'me'. In its logic it treats everything with impartiality yet there is a self apparent entity 'I'. It's inconsistent. Such probabilities has caused many anthropic paradoxes such as the doomsday argument, the sleeping beauty problem, the presumptuous philosopher and the simulation argument. That, to me, means MWI is incorrect in a logical sense.";0;dlvjor;[]

In the study of entropy, there is a concept known as the boltzmann brain. Essentially, if the universe is infinitely old then the probability that insane coincidences will happen rises to infinity. The example they give is that particles come together in an arrangement which is your brain thinking the thoughts it does now.
If the many worlds interpretation is true then there are an infinite amount if worlds where where physics is absolutely fucked up.
Some examples:
A universe where everytime you put gas into an aluminum container it all clings to the right wall.
A universe where no car has ever hit a human being and they can't be made to do so on purpose.
A world where everytime we try to use a particle collider all of the particles quantum tunnel out of the collider.
A world where everytime you say someone's name they are attacked by a massive flock of birds.
A world similar to the above but it only works if they ae actually named Bob and legally changing their name has am effect on this.
A world where all objects that are more than six feet underground experience anti gravity because all of the wave forms collapse in the upward direction.
The reason these work is because of quantum immortality. Each time something would happen that would be different from these, a new world is split off into one where the crazy occurrence happened again.
The worst part is that, in each of these crazy worlds, the inhabitants deduce laws of physics based on these. Those will be entirely consistent and will work to predict their future. But it will only do so on accident because the real laws of probability and physics are being pushed to their limits.
This means that they have no way of knowing that what they think are the laws of physics are in fact just an ever growing chain of improbable coincidences. That also means we don't know that our universe isn't an ever growing chain of improbable coincidences. It is impossible to ever prove that we aren't because, the nature of the system, wil always create a version where our experiment failed to break us out.
The standard quantum physics models talk about how likely things are. Outcome A is 50% likely, B is 30% likely, and C is 20% likely. In the many worlds interpretation A, B, C, D, E,... are all equally likely because they all have a 100% chance of happening.";0;dlvjor;[]

It's been used in star trek and stargate and any number of sci fi books and series. It's pretty much the most well known staple of quantum mechanics that a layperson is likely know about, second only to Schrodinger's cruelty to small furry creatures.

People always think there are different versions based on what decisions we make. But that would require deciding which decisions or choices were big enough to warrant a new universe. Which would, of course, require some evaluation of each decision. Otherwise, every single moment of time, when billions of decisions are made my people, animals, etc. would branch off into another universe. Frankly, there'd be billions of universes that are mostly the same, save for 1 or 2 minor details. And with all those universes, seriously what's the point even?;0;dlvjor;[]

When they become available (in a few decades) open source bitcoin will have adjusted its protocol long in advance. Bitcoin is antifragile, the more is attacked, the stronger it gets. And when the age comes where quantum computers ARE a threat, both the bad guys and the good guys, and the average citizen, will have them. It'll be much like it is now. Most progress made in the hardware industry is pretty linear. Worrying about quantum computers right now is certainly a waste of energy, given that quantum computers are still in their infantile stages, and can only operate at absolute zero temperatures. (Hint: It's an extremely difficult job to find a way to bring absolute zero cooling methods to the consumer market.). While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography.
Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC. Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat.

The best paper in this area has been [Quantum Attacks on Bitcoin, and how to protect against them]( (2017-10-28) which models the progress of gate speed, gate fidelity and overall qubits to make the statement: ""On the other hand, the elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most optimistic estimates"".
I'm not going to lie, 9 years seems like a long ways away, but cryptographers work with generally long timelines, which why [they're standardizing now]( and have been [talking about it in an organized fashion for a long time, ~2006]( It's also why [google has been experimenting with PQ Crypto since 2016 in Google chrome](
What I'm getting at is preparations for both centralized and decentralized systems need to start now or soon, and decentralized systems even earlier. While 5 years does seem unrealistic, this isn't something that I think bitcoin should be waiting *until* it's a problem, especially as it approaches a trillion dollar marketcap (speculation, but this year?). To put another way, the chance of a black swan event might be low, but the severity would be very high. I wont get into difficulties of migration to a Post-Quantum scheme.
I guess, I use BTC day to day (or at least week to week) and would like to see a *precautionary* approach rather than a reactionary one. There are issues to overcome like scaling, but the bottom line is that it's the security that's the basis of the bitcoin ledger and without it, everything falls apart. If it falls apart, I will have to keep on using banks for much longer.";0;8kipnn;[]

These particles collide with the particles close to them, which in-turn causes them vibrate too. This movement propagates as sound waves. Our brain interprets these vibrations as sound. **What is a phonon?** A crystal is a solid in which the atoms are arranged in a highly ordered structure (e.g diamond). The vibrational energy of the atoms in a crystal propagates through the crystal as waves. A phonon is a discrete unit of vibrational energy in a crystal. The concept of a phonon is similar to that of a photon which is the discrete unit of light energy.
**Is a phonon a particle?** Phonons are referred to as quasi-particles. Quasi-particles describe a phenomenon, which considers excitations in solids as particles. As these particles do not consist of matter, they are called quasi particles.";0;cht3h7;[]

However, many experts -- including Scott Aaronson (who is mentioned in the article) -- have cast doubt on D-Wave's claims, because the company has not yet proved that its machines are producing results by exploiting quantum phenomena like particle entanglement and superposition. In other words, D-Wave's devices may very well be different, but still classical, computers. D-Wave's engineers acknowledge as much: they are quoted in the article stating that ""they don't yet know for sure what's happening inside the chip.""
The fact that Bezos, a very smart guy, has invested in D-Wave, has changed my perception of the company from ""these are likely crazy people making outrageous claims"" to ""maybe these guys are unto something."" Exciting and a bit scary. Time will tell.";0;10y17u;[]

To get to the heart of the matter:
> The natural question is whether 'non-causal' quantum correlations of the kind described by our formalism can be found in nature. One can speculate that they may exist in unprobed physical regimes, such as, for example, those in which quantum mechanics and general relativity become relevant. Indeed, our result that classical theories can always be understood in terms of a global causal structure suggests the possibility that the observed causal order of space-time might not be a fundamental property of nature but rather emerge from a more fundamental theory.
So, they didn't *actually* find correlations that defied causality. They found a way with fancy maths to come up with *potential* correlations that would defy causality. Whether or not those correlations *actually exist* is unknown.

Such instances exist but only in super-world. The world that we know today does not support such conditions where the super-quantum laws of physics can exist. Physics is dependent on the matter and it's substance and there co-relation with the existing environment. For cause to be equally relevant with the effect at all times(past, present, future) it will have to exceed it's own existing self and will have to be in that state at all times. Surprisingly there is no such matter except soul. The sole reason behind it is that the matter should have the consciousness to enable it to be in super-Quanta state at all times to make effect and cause resembling at all times.

- A prejudice can lead to the according behavior to arise, so that it's difficult to say whether it's knowledge of people or self fulfilling prophecy when people start acting strange in some situations.
- A physical experiment can lead to a tested property to come into existence. There is for instance a discussion whether colliders help analyse matter or whether they create completely new kinds of matter.
- Police overeager to find crime can easily cause people to become bad.

This is not a natural expectation for me, so I decided to look at [the actual paper]( instead of the press release. Surprisingly, the argument looks valid (though not sound) on a first glance. I'll summarize it for the benefit of others here:
1. Assume global causal order is not the case.
2. Assume standard quantum formalism only holds locally.
3. [insert complex math I skimmed through and assume is correct here]
4. The math is consistent with nonstandard global causes, such as described in the press release.
While this argument is by no means cogent due to sketchy premises, it is nevertheless an amazing finding in my opinion. I guess I just always assumed that the math *required* a global causal order, but this result shows that there is no contradiction from ""a causing b causing a"" scenarios.
Compare this to similarly famous discoveries showing that nothing inherently prevents time travel. It doesn't mean time travel (or alternate causal orders) must be possible, but it does open up the possibility given today's understanding of QM.";0;10vxar;[]

I didn't expect our work to spark such a discussion. Given the many questions and speculations, I would like to join and try to offer some clarifications to the best of my capabilities.
In fact, some comments got very close to the actual content of the paper. In particular, the interpretation of our result as a situatiotoin of the kind |A causes B> + |B causes A> is possibly among the best possible. However... there is a however :). Imagine tossing a coin, if head comes out, you arrange your experiment such that A causes B, if tail is the result, you arrange B causes A. (A and B are operations that produce measurement results and that can influence each other, for example the measurement of a photon's polarization followed by the preparation of a new polarization state. If A is first B will measure the polarization prepared in A and the other way around). This is perfectly fine with classical physics and causal order: the two possibilities simply take place with 50% probability.
Now imagine a quantum version of this: a ""quantum coin"" can be in a superposition |head> + |tail> (the favorite choice where I come from is a photon on a beam-splitter, but any other quantum system would serve the purpose). If, as before, you have an experimental arrangement such that ""if head than A causes B"" and ""if tail than B causes A"", you end up in a situation that you can describe as |head>|A causes B> + |tail>|B causes A>. This is (almost) standard quantum mechanics, which can be realized in the lab. There are in fact some cute things one can do with such a state, on which we are working at the moment. (""Almost"" because traditionally operations are put in a causal sequence by construction, so this situation would be phrased in a slightly different, more complicated way.)
Is this what we are talking about in our work? Well, actually... no. The problem is that, in the example above, the causal relation can be known by measuring the ouctome of the coin toss (head or tail). It turns out that, if you only consider the events A and B, the measurement results are indistinguishable from the classical situation described at the beginning: each of the two possibilities happens with 50% probability. Is a ""genuine"" situation ""|A causes B> + |B causes A>"" possible at all? We found that it is possible, but one needs to ""stretch"" a little more the standard quantum formalism so that it can describe all situations where the order of events is not pre-defined. In the resulting formalism the expression ""|A causes B> + |B causes A>"" doesn't make sense any more as a sum in a vector space, but there is something that very much resembles it. Still, if in the experiment you simply ask the question ""wihch one was first"", you will find one of the two possibilties with 50% probability. However, if you ask a different kind of question (a specific set of measurements at A and B, a sort of two-player game), one finds that no probabilistic mixture of the two orders can describe what's going on. The ""stretching"" of the theory is a minimal one: everything is exactly as in quantum mechanics, except for the order of events (and standard quantum mechanics is retreived once a definte order is imposed).
Does all this have anything to do with nature? We are not sure. However, we already know situations in general relativity that challenge the idea of events-ordering. When combined with quantum mechanics, there are no clear reasons not to expect situations similar to ours to appear. However, since no consistent theory of quantum gravity exists yet, we cannot give a definite answer as of yet.
Our results are sometimes interpreted as a version of quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping, interference in time, double-time formulation of quantum mechanics and similar. The key difference is that the notion of ""causal order"" we refer to relays on actual signalling: ""A causes B"" means that the outcome observed in B depends on the choice of which operation is performed at A. In contrast, the ""quantum retrocausality"" often mentioned is an interpretation, based on specific assumptions, of correlations that don't allow any exchange of information. I apologize for the length of the post, but I hope you will find it useful.

Photons are entangled by passing them through certain non-linear crystals. (We've recently discovered some semiconductor LEDs that do it much more efficiently.) Once you have an entangled pair, any change to the polarization of one will change the polarization of the other, no matter how far apart they are.
In this experiment, they entangled a pair of photons at different frequencies -- one yellow, one red. The yellow photons were shined at a stencil of a cat. The red photons were not. They were then recombined (I think; the article isn't clear) into a single beam of light and into a camera that could only detect the red photons. The image of the cat appeared, although the red photons never touched the stencil.
Two possible applications for this comes to mind, one highly speculative. It's long been considered to be impossible to send information via entangled photons. When you change one photon's polarity, the entangled partner changes instantly no matter how far away, and that would allow you to send information faster than the speed of light. There are reasons why this can't work to send information...but this experiment may be finding a crack in that theory. If so, this could potentially lead to faster than light communications. That's unlikely but it's there.
On a less speculative note, the article suggests one near-term application in imaging. You could shine one light frequency (probably low-energy X-rays) through an object and use a different frequency to look at the image. This could lead to very low exposure X-ray machines, internal imaging of certain materials that we could never look into before (like ferrous metals), and other new imaging tricks.";0;2ewfl3;[]

In other words, the data was copied from the printed image to the camera in zero time?
I've read that entanglement can't happen over long distances, but if it could doesn't that mean we could put a entanglement beam splitter half way between New York and Los Angeles and get data sent from LA to New York in zero time?
And, if we can do it over short distances, doesn't that mean we could build a series of small devices that link to each other via entanglement and create a cable of any length that has zero transmission time?

The orders-of-magnitude higher performance in specific tasks than their classical counterparts comes from quantum computers not working on exact computation methods. Instead, they describe how probable a solution is - before making a measurement.
uhh me no understand. it's doing math via wave-function collapse? i literally just watched this a few days ago so it rang a bell: []( If that fuckers doing math by way of wave-function collapse... feels like my brain shuddered a bit just from the concept passing through my mind... that's dangerously close to computing the future, right? probably futures, I mean";0;v83f5h;[]

How do you luck into finding two entangled particles such that one isn't already way off on the other side of Pluto where you can do nothing useful with it?

Yes, the electron has a state before you measure it. However, there's no way to know what that is until you measure it. When we say state here we mean it's spinning around and atom one way or the other.
You sort of have to understand how ludicrously tiny electrons are for this to make sense, and how fast they're whipping about. That's why we describe them as energy levels. The old ""model of an electron"" with a visible orbit is actually silly. It would be more accurate to describe a spherical blur around the nucleus; that's how fast they're going.
Anyway at that scale in order to observe or ""measure"" which way the electron is moving, the only way we know how to do that is going to fuck with the electron. Stop telling people electrons don't have a spin state until they're measured. That's just disingenuous. Of course they do. That state is totally meaningless to us though unless we can ever figure out a way to measure it without interfering. I'm a science fiction writer. Is my understanding far off base?";0;26u06z;[]

There's a lot of confused discussion in the top comments, including a lot of deleted stuff. I've studied this field for a while, so I'm hoping to clarify a few things.
First, the title is quite definitely misleading. What is ""reliable"" teleportation? People have been doing quantum teleportation experiments for some time, so are those experiments somehow unreliable?
If you read between the lines a little in the article, the author is contrasting the usual experiments (i.e. using lasers across large distances) with work going on in Delft involving nitrogen vacancy centres in diamonds. The contrast is in something called post-selection.
Entanglement is necessary for quantum teleportation. To create entangled light, you need to send your beam through something called a parametric down-converter. A parametric down-converter is a non-linear crystal that has a small probability of converting one photon into two. By conservation of spin and momentum, these two photons are entangled with respect to these variables. This means, of course, that you need to produce a lot of light for very little entanglement. You can just throw away all the light that didn't get down-converted, a process called post-selection. It is in this sense that the author is describing the usual methods as ""unreliable"".
I haven't read the actual Science paper that this article is hyping (yes, it's hyping, and it's an unfortunate aspect of the business end of science that scientists must develop a relationship with the press in order to help secure funding). But going by what the [group in question]( says on its website, the work being described is basically a technical achievement. No one is sure what technology will be used for commercial quantum information processors, and NV-centres in diamond is one promising piece of what is likely to be a complex and expensive whole. Teleportation is one of the foundational quantum information processing protocols, so showing that it can be done with a candidate technology is an important achievement. It's being done without post-selection, just like everything else in NV-centres. This is not a particularly remarkable achievement.
None of this has anything to do with Einstein. Einstein raised objections to quantum theory based on his particular philosophy of physics, which many people happen to share and most people would describe as intuitive. It has been known for a long time, however, that Einstein was fundamentally if subtly mistaken. Bohr was eminently capable of proving Einstein wrong, more than anyone in history. It's probably difficult to read if you don't have a Physics degree, but [Bohr's essay on the subject is required reading for anyone who wants to understand what Einstein was really saying and why he was wrong about it](";0;26u06z;[]

What if a group of 3 particles are entangled, with Alice having 2 and Bob having 1.
At predetermined time intervals (eg every 0.1ms), Bob measures his entangled particle if he wishes to communicate a 1 in binary times. This will cause Alice's two entangled particles (in the same entanglement group) to take form of the same, opposite spin direction of Bob's particle.
Bob does not measure his entangled particle if he wishes to communicate a 0. This keeps all of the 3 entangled particles still in a superposition.
At every 0.1ms, Alice measures both of her entangled particles. If Bob has already measured the entangled particle, Alice will find that both of her entangled particles have the same spin. However, if Bob has not measured, then when Alice measures one of her entangled particles, the other entangled particle will find itself to the opposite spin state, and Alice will find her two entangled particles are different. This would mean that information would be passable.

> Time has a fundamentally different character in quantum mechanics and in general relativity. In quantum theory events unfold in a fixed order while in general relativity temporal order is influenced by the distribution of matter. When matter requires a quantum description, temporal order is expected to become non-classicala scenario beyond the scope of current theories. Here we provide a direct description of such a scenario. We consider a thought experiment with a massive body in a spatial superposition and show how it leads to entanglement of temporal orders between time-like events. This entanglement enables accomplishing a task, violation of a Bell inequality, that is impossible under local classical temporal order; it means that temporal order cannot be described by any pre-defined local variables. A classical notion of a causal structure is therefore untenable in any framework compatible with the basic principles of quantum mechanics and classical general relativity.";0;cu871h;[]

Denver runs ahead of Miami beach. Now, the arm wave. They imagine a gravitational mass that has quantum properties. This could exist in several locations, each of which would have differing effects on the two clocks. Alternatively, you have two masses that have differing probabilities of existing. (Yes, I know.) This would alter the relative time that the clocks tell in ways that would be ""quantum determined"". So time is indeterminate and with a yet greater arm wave, they adduce from this that so is causality. Modest problem is that the physical uncertainty of a massive body is utterly trivial.

Im fairly certain they are simply referring to the barrier-bound which uses the Dyson equation. Its used to describe how subatomic particles move throughout flat space. Hawking then tried to apply the same equation to curved space surrounding a black hole so he could come up with a proper theory of his Hawking radiation which describes how black holes lose energy over time as well as separating particle pairs which can cause the information paradox which violates the laws of conservation of energy (energy cannot be created nor destroyed). The solution to that came in the form of the holographic principle which suggests that rather than living an a 3d world with a fourth dimension of time (3+1 dimensions) we live in a 2d dimension with 1 dimension of time (2+1 dimensions) and that our universe is actually a projection of that 2d image. This solves the information paradox because the information encoded on every subatomic particle is now no longer lost or destroyed but instead that information is encapsulated on the surface of the event horizon (from our perspective). In all reality the information actually passed through the event horizon but due to the way that gravity itself warps time, we dont get to see that. Whatever went in stops as it meets the event horizon. Regardless the information is never actually destroyed seeing as its stored on the surface of the black hole as well as having fallen IN to the black hole. This explains the relativity of time. Remember, space tells matter how to move, matter tells space how to bend.
All of this is important because I feel like their article may also be describing the double slit experiment which describes Einsteins spooky action at a distance which is now known as quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement shows us that by observing one particle, it seemingly can change a particle its entangled with from incredible distances which would violate the universal speed limit which is the speed of light. However, this was also explained in theory, due to the fact that it has nothing to do with the particles actually going faster than the speed of light. The reason being is because any time you go to measure one of those subatomic particles, the act of measuring it using electro magnetism (photons) changes its spin simply because youre firing a proton at it which is incredibly energetic and more or less massless allowing it to move at the speed of light. The fact that a particles spin is based on electromagnetism is why this disrupts the spin of the particles. I guess I should also say that particle pairs also will always try to remain neutral in regard to their charge. The universe itself always seeks neutrality to more or less balance the universal checkbook and make sure that information (Energy) is never created or destroyed. So how arent they violating the universal speed limit? The difference comes in the amount of time it takes from measuring the spin of these particles. Every time you measure one particle it changes its spin, however the time change is caused by the time it takes between the measurements because to know both you have to measure both, and with photons moving at the speed of light, there will always be a discrepancy in time because your measurements will always alter the state of the particle and the photons themselves are moving at the speed of light whereas the information being taken from the measurement of the particle moves slower than the speed of light. So why is that important? It shows that the particles arent violating the laws of physics meaning they arent going backward or forward in time. It keeps the arrow of time going in the same direction. Another way this is also explained can be seen using a Feynman diagram. Feynman diagrams show us what happens when two subatomic particles collide and what happens to the particles during that collision. The quantum world is weird in the sense of with Feynman diagrams you have to find all of the different possibilities that would explain the likelihood of what caused the particles that resulted from the collision to act as they did. The reason why its important to have ALL of the possibilities that could explain the result of the collision is because with subatomic particles you never actually know where they are with 100% accuracy. Its all probability based on where the particle could be. This is due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which states that you can never know both a particles location and spin at the same time. Whenever you know one its impossible to know the other. When the particle is stopped in order to be observed to know where its at, youre no longer able to tell how fast its moving, due to the fact that its frozen in time. The same can be said if you know a particles spin because for you to observe its spin, you wont have any idea of where its at because its moving at speeds approaching the speed of light, you cant actually pinpoint it.";0;cu871h;[]

Quantum magnetism is a bit different from classical magnetism, the kind you see when you stick a magnet to a fridge, because individual atoms have a quality called spin, which is quantized, or in discrete states (usually called up or down). Seeing the behavior of individual atoms has been hard to do, though, because it required cooling atoms to extremely cold temperatures and finding a way to ""trap"" them.
The new finding, detailed in the May 24 issue of the journal Science, also opens the door to better understanding physical phenomena, such as superconductivity, which seems to be connected to the collective quantum properties of some materials. [Twisted Physics: 7 Mind-Blowing Findings]
Spin science
The research team at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich focused on atoms' spin, because that's what makes magnets magnetic all the spins of the atoms in a bar magnet are pointed the same way.
To get a clear view of atoms' spin behaviors, the researchers had to cool potassium atoms to near absolute zero. That way, the random thermal ""noise"" basically background radiation and heat didn't spoil the view by jostling the potassium atoms around.
The scientists then created an ""optical lattice"" a crisscrossing set of laser beams. The beams interfere with each other and create regions of high and low potential energy. Neutral atoms with no charge will tend to sit in the lattice's ""wells,"" which are regions of low energy.
Once the lattice is built, the atoms will sometimes randomly ""tunnel"" through the sides of the wells, because the quantum nature of particles allows them to be in multiple places at the same time, or to have varying amounts of energy. [Quantum Physics: The Coolest Little Particles in Nature]
Another factor that determines where the atoms lie in the optical lattice is their up or down spin. Two atoms can't be in the same well if their spins are the same. That means atoms will have a tendency to tunnel into wells with others that have opposite spins. After a while, a line of atoms should spontaneously organize itself, with the spins in a non-random pattern. This kind of behavior is different from materials in the macroscopic world, whose orientations can have a wide range of in-between values; this behavior is also why most things aren't magnets the spins of the electrons in the atoms are oriented randomly and cancel each other out.
And that's exactly what the researchers found. The spins of atoms do organize, at least on the scale the experiment examined.
""The question is, what are the magnetic properties of these one-dimensional chains?"" said Tilman Esslinger, a professor of physics at ETH whose lab did the experiments. ""Do I have materials with these properties? How can these properties be useful?""
Quantum magnetism
This experiment opens up possibilities for increasing the number of atoms in a lattice, and even creating two-dimensional, gridlike arrangements of atoms, and possibly triangular lattices as well.
One debate among experts is whether at larger scales the spontaneous ordering of atoms would happen in the same way. A random pattern would mean that in a block of iron atoms, for instance, one is just as likely to see a spin up or down atom in any direction. The spin states are in what is called a ""spin liquid"" a mishmash of states. But it could be that atoms spontaneously arrange themselves at larger scales.
""They've put the foundation on various theoretical matters,"" said Jong Han, a professor of condensed matter physics theory at the State University of New York at Buffalo, who was not involved in the research. ""They don't really establish the long-range order, rather they wanted to establish that they have observed a local magnetic order.""
Whether the order the scientists found extends to larger scales is an important question, because magnetism itself arises from the spins of atoms when they all line up. Usually those spins are randomly aligned. But at very low temperatures and small scales, that changes, and such quantum magnets behave differently.
Han noted that such lattices, especially configurations where the potential wells connect to three others, rather than two or four, would be especially interesting. Esslinger's lab showed that atoms tend to jump to potential wells where the spins are opposite; but if the wells are arranged so that the atom can jump to two other atoms, it can't ""choose"" which well to go to because one of the two atoms will always be in the same spin state.
Esslinger said his lab wants to try building two-dimensional lattices and explore that very question. ""What happens to magnetism if I change the geometry? It's no longer clear if spins should be up or down.""";0;1f3tbb;[]

I'm not very knowledgeable in magnetism, but in this case he's referring to the atom's nucleus, right? Because as far as electrons are concerned, the spins of two electrons in an orbital can never be equal (Pauli's exclusion principle). Or is he talking about the atom as a whole?";0;1f3tbb;[]

> Quantum teleportation, or entanglement-assisted teleportation, is a technique used to transfer quantum information from one quantum system to another. It does not transport the system itself, nor does it allow communication of information at superluminal (faster than light) speed. Neither does it concern rearranging the particles of a macroscopic object to copy the form of another object. *Its distinguishing feature is that it can transmit the information present in a quantum superposition, useful for quantum communication and computation.*";0;c5wwv;[]

Matthias Troyer's team ( has written code that runs on a good old classical GPU and that outperforms the D-Wave machine. The D-Wave machine is still a few orders of magnitude slower than that lowly GPU code.
Also, it is not clear how useful the types of optimization the DWave CPU really are -- it is certainly not capable of universal quantum computation, i.e., can't run Shor's algorithm (not that that is very useful for much).

[Here is an earlier presentation](, (the one I saw was more current, in that linked presentation he compares against a GPU system, (similar compute topology to large-core-count Intel sever CPU's) instead).
The D-Wave computer solves ONE and only ONE type of problem topology: the [Ising Spin Glass Problem]( Dr. Troyer analyzed the computer statistically against 3 topolgies:
- Simulated Quantum Annealing
- Simulated Classical Annealing
- One other that I can't remember (don't have notes with me).
The D-Wave system correlated HIGHLY against the simulated quantum annealing and quite low with the other two topologies. In my opinion, this is sufficient evidence, for now, to establish its credibility as a legitimately new system, and to validate their claims about HOW it operates.
What does NOT match up, however, are their claims about performance speedup. Dr. Troyer, using a server Intel CPU, (8 Core Xeon, with HT enabled) with optimized code, ran a speed test against various topologies of the Ising spin glass problem itself. He found that, with respect to wall-clock time, that not only does the D-Wave chip underperform in the small set size regime, but that, in the large set size regime, (something that you would use this 1000-qubit processor for), it scales almost identically to the Intel hardware, which is obviously, a small fraction of the cost of the D-Wave One/Two/whatever. In fact, there are certain problem topologies that it straight up can not solve within a reasonable time limit, (it is a heuristic solver, so that was almost expected), that the Intel CPU can, (though it takes substantially longer to do so than you would think).
TL;DR - IS a quantum annealer: inherently limited to one type of computation. Performs like shit anyways. Don't buy one unless you want to pump money into the ASIC fabrication supply chain, relating specifically to materials used for qubit systems, (pretty sure that's the only reason Google, etc are selling this so hard).
EDIT: 8 Core Xeon w/ HT. EDIT 2: My post may sound rather incriminating of D-Wave. IMO All of these efforts are useful, the modern CMOS architectures were not built in a day, or even a decade. However, D-Wave has been..... not careful.... when marketing itself, or allowing itself to be reported in the press. For years articles about its machines were mostly incoherent pieces of technobabble with nonsense claims.

>Here we show that, while in nature the complex conjugation needed for time reversal may appear exponentially improbable, one can design a quantum algorithm that includes complex conjugation and thus reverses a given quantum state.

Meaning:
* This reversal was not performed in a closed system, but was instead driven by a specific device.
* The second law of thermodynamics still holds in general for closed systems.
* The flow of time was not ever actually reversed in this system, however a quantum states evolution was successfully reversed. Its cool and useful, but it's not time travel.

ONE: You Can't Win. Mater and energy can never be created or destroyed, only changed. The only way to end up with more matter/energy (for they are both forms of each other) is to get it from outside the system - but that only changes our focus to a larger system.
TWO: You Can't Break Even. If energy can leak out of a system, it will. If not, it will flatten out across the system as much as possible. This process is called entropy, and is the common source of all chaos and death in the universe. It is the common source of everything human beings consider to be bad.

That is, the ""arrow of time"" (where billiard balls go in direction of disordered looking vs ordered looking), is purely an outcome of ""ordered looking"" states being far less/rare compared to the ""disordered looking"" states (which to a human may look all the same ie total disordered, but which each are unique in their own way).
As a result when we progress from an ordered state, it almost always seems to go towards disorder from an initial ordered state.
And this is the seeming ""arrow of time"". Basically only practically observable usually only when an outside agent is able to coerce a system into one of those very few ""ordered looking"" states (which would be rare if system was on it's own).

>Most laws of physics make no distinction between the future and the past. For example, let an equation describe the collision and rebound of two identical billiard balls. If a close-up of that event is recorded with a camera and played in reverse, it can still be represented by the same equation. Moreover, it is not possible to distinguish from the recording if it has been doctored. Both versions look plausible. It would appear that the billiard balls defy the intuitive sense of time.

>Quantum physicists from MIPT decided to check if time could spontaneously reverse itself at least for an individual particle and for a tiny fraction of a second. That is, instead of colliding billiard balls, they examined a solitary electron in empty interstellar space.
I don't fully understand this study's result - whether the system transitioned to a more ""ordered looking"" configuration because of some constrained dynamics or what.

A violation of the law of entropy would be the greatest discovery in physics ever (and require a major rewriting of our basic theories of the world. There would need to be some time asymmetry in one of the equations) but we need to be cautious before accepting such a claim. There were many false starts for this.

If a measure (at same time) is observed by two persons from the same photon - could this just be a mistake in the test setting, where the observation 1 is marked to occur first but it didnt.
Then the observation 2 that was made actually at same time, is considered to happen later (the wave function collapse) which actually just meant that the objective reality isnt objective at all.
Two measures at same time from same object.
Different results does not mean that time is moving backwards although it might seem like that position and extrapolation wise?
It sounds like the moment of time draws boundries where eg. the electron cloud can exist.
If you take single measurements from a single electron, you could think that it moved back in time although it actually was just measured at a different position at the same time.

The teleportation we speak of depends on entanglement of quantum states. Two particles are entangled when they are described by a single wavefunction and you cannot decompose their state as being two separable wavefunctions. This means that a measurement on one particle instantly affects the other. This ""spooky action at a distance"" was the reason Einstein did not believe that quantum theory was complete.
One of the most common examples of an entangled state of two particles is the so-called singlet state. I will connect this analogy to each particle being a coin that can be H(Heads) or T(Tails)
Singlet state = [1/sqrt(2)] ( |HT> - |TH> )
The [1/sqrt(2)] is simply a normalization factor, it's not important for the discussion.
To be fully clear: |HT> = 1st coin is heads, 2nd coin is tails
This quantum state describes a 50/50 chance each particle is in the state heads or tails.
However, once you make a measurement on either coin, you necessarily know the state of the other coin.
If we look at the 1st coin and it's T, the wavefunction is changed instantly from this measurement and the |HT> component is projected out because we know the 1st coin is not heads. This leaves us with |TH> so we know that the 2nd coin is heads.
Regardless of the distance between the two particles, once a measurement is made on one particle of the entangled state it instantly affects the others. Now to preserve causality... if Alice and Bob are very far away and Alice makes a measurement on her coin and it is tails, Bob won't know that his coin is heads until Alice communicates via a classical channel( limited by the speed of light) what her result was. Then he knows what state his coin is, without having to measure it and irreversibly affect it.

To over simplify: Quantum teleportation does transfer information instantly - it just can't be read instantly. When measured, the information is transferred ""faster"" (it's instant) than the speed of light - the speed of light is not the restriction on (quantum) information transfer, but on how quick we can interpret that information. MIND BLOWN! yes, it's that awesome.
Basically, some quantum information is ""transferred"" instantly, but needs a ""key"" (a piece of classical information) to be sent classically (effectively at a speed less than speed of light) in order to interpret that quantum information. The key can be as little as two bits classical information - something as simple as a flashing light. (aside: quantum information is about the spin directions of measured particles (which can encode complex information) - and in the future, maybe larger objects)
So say, you had a severe electrical storm between your satellite and your base on venus, and you wanted to send some complex information from the base to the satellite. You worried complex information sent directly through the storm would be scrambled - so you use quantum teleportation to change the states of some quantum system on the satellite from the base, then send a 2 bit key by a flashing laser from the base (much more likely to be interpreted correctly through the storm) in order to decode the complex information that had been sent. and viola! Quantum Teleportation for the win. (kinda stole this example from Penrose - road to reality)
NOTE! nothing is being teleported like in star trek - think of it as instant bluetooth that needs a infarred (different type of information transfer) key to be sent in order to interpret it.
Also, ""transferred"" here is misleading, as it's a philosophical question as to whether two entangled particles can be considered as separate entities from this perspective. AND IT'S AN AWESOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION! but not as misleading as saying ""at the speed of light"" as instant is effectively much quicker than that. FUN FUN FUN!

For example, take 2 small pieces of paper. Write the letter A on one. Write the letter Z on the other. Crumple/fold/whatever them. Mix them up. They're now entangled. Send one to your cousin the other side of the world and explain the A/Z rule. It will never move FTL. But once your cousin opens his piece of paper, he instantly knows what your piece of paper says.

The goal of quantum teleportation is to transfer a target state of a qubit C(a classical bit with superposition allowed, so infinitely many states possible) from Alice to Bob, without the qubit having to cross over the space between Alice and Bob. Before the teleportation process, we need:
1. The qubit C itself in the target state in Alice's possession.
2. Two more qubits, A and B, which are in possession of Alice and Bob respectively. A and B are to be in ""Bell states"" which are collective states of two qubits(there are four of these collective states, any one of them will do for this step). If entanglement is spooky action at a distance, then these Bell states are the spookiest of them all(maximally entangled).
3. A classical communication channel from Alice to Bob capable of sending two bits of information.
The teleportation process occurs in the following steps:
1. Alice performs a ""Bell state measurement"" on the qubits in her possession(A and C), collapsing them into one of four possible Bell states.
2. Due to the entanglement between Alice's and Bob's qubit, qubit B would collapse into a state that resembles the target state upon Alice performing her Bell state measurement. More specifically, B could end up in one of four possible states, one of which is the target state exactly and the other three are ""siblings"" of the target state that are ""flipped""(one unitary transformation away) in different ways compared to the target state. Bob does not yet know which state B is in, so at this stage there is only a 25% chance that the target state has been successfully teleported from C to B.
3. Alice then has to send the result of her Bell state measurement(ie which one of the four Bell states her qubits, A and C, collectively ended up in) to Bob via a classical channel.
4. To complete the teleportation, Bob takes Alice's information, and adjusts qubit B accordingly: depending on which one of four Bell state A and C are in, Bob will perform one of four corresponding ""unitary transformations"" on qubit B.
After these steps, qubit B would end up in the target state that qubit C started in, and the state of qubit C has been transferred to qubit B without any qubits crossing over from Alice to Bob.
Note that during this process, qubits A and C become entangled, so C will no longer be in the target state. Also, the entanglement between qubits A and B are destroyed, so you would have to prepare another entangled qubit pair for Alice and Bob if another teleportation is to be done.
Edit: some wordings, also the specific implementation of teleportation may be different, but the basic idea should be the same.";0;kpmur0;[]

When the imaging laser was off, or turned on only dimly, the atoms tunneled freely.

So basically, you have to shine a laser at them, and the intensity of the laser changes their movement...

Imagine it's night time and you have a billion people arranged in a grid. You've got a camera way up in the air looking down at these people, but you can't see them because it's night time. So, on some of the people, you've put reflective tape (like runners wear) on the tops of their heads. You have a bright flash bulb so that you can flash it and you will briefly see the light reflect off of the tape and see the location of those few people within the grid.
Now, classically, we would expect that if I flash the light and observe a person in position #633 for example, then when I flash it later they'd still be in position #633 (this system is cold so the ""people"" won't move).
Quantum mechanics, however, predicts that if I wait long enough between flashes (let's say an hour), then occasionally the person in #633 will have switched positions with the person in #632 or #634, and if I wait longer they might have even switched with #635 or further. QM even has mathematical predictions as to how far on average they would jump.
If, however, I flash the light very quickly (let's say once every second), then the chances they moved in the short amount of time are pretty much zero. The interesting part is that if I continue to flash the light once a second for 3600 seconds (= 60 minutes = 1 hour) or even longer, then I will still see the person in position #633 remain in position #633.
It appears that the act of flashing the light does more than just let us see it, it also resets the internal quantum mechanical clock of the person back to 0, which is a little weird.
Edit: I should add, this result in some ways is not a new result, but this experiment is an extremely good experiment. Previous results that are similar have been sort of all or nothing (you only look once or you keep the light on all the time, to attempt to continue with the analogy), but this one allows us to fine tune and see the transition from quantum behavior to classical behavior in a continuous way by adjusting the detecting flash's frequency and intensity.
**Edit 2**: Upon digging deeper, my analogy might need adjustment. I don't think the people are in a tight grid, but in a spacious grid with empty gaps. Instead of swapping with another person, the person is moving to a vacant space due to Quantum Mechanics. In the classical limit they would still remain in their place though.
**Edit 3**: Getting a lot of great questions, and some of them repeated, so I'll try to expand more.
* There are two different lasers. The first sets up a standing wave and this standing wave holds the atoms in place, like an egg carton holding eggs. This egg carton doesn't interact with the atoms significantly enough to affect the outcome of the experiment beyond holding them in place. In our analogy, think of it as walls built around each grid, so the person can't walk from one grid to the other. The second laser is the one we use for detection, this is the light source we use to watch the atoms (people) move around (or not move around).
* There are two different Quantum effects that some confuse, the [Uncertainty Principle]( and the [Observer Effect]( This experiment has both. In physics ""observing"" and ""interacting with"" are synonyms, so whenever we talk about watching it's because we shoot photons at the atoms, the electrons absorb those photons, and then the electrons lose that energy and emit different photons (like if I give you a $20 bill and you give me back two $10 bills). We detect the emitted photons and that's how we know where the atoms are. The net result is the atoms remain unchanged. The Uncertainty Principle is the reason the atoms sometimes move. If we weren't firing our second laser the people would occasionally move from one grid space to a nearby empty grid space. This is done through Quantum Tunneling, and might seem unusual if you're unfamiliar with Quantum Mechanics but is well understood (and has been experimentally verified for many decades, and even used to design things like semiconductor materials). The neat part is that the tunneling essentially gets turned off when we're ""watching"" the atoms, i.e. when we fire photons at them and force the atoms to tell us where they are. Even if we weren't around to ""listen"" to the reply, they'd still be stuck where they were just from the photon interaction,
* The really cool part of this experiment has to do with the fact that we can tune the rate of firing light at the atoms. Essentially, lights off means Quantum behavior, lights on means Classical behavior... and now we can dim the lights to anywhere in between, and reduce the amount of Quantum behavior that we get.";0;3pw7xy;[]

The answer is that the fabric of the reality we live in is infomation, the manifestation of that information is probabilistic and statistical, and that measuring a particle in the same position when we believe it should be moving is not inconsistent with the rule set of this reality. What that means is that say you measure an atom in location A (or state A) at time A. Over time, say from time A until 1 hour after time A, the probability that the atom will have moved(or progressed from state A to state B) goes from 0% to 100% on a gradient.
Now, say you measure the particles at time A plus 30 minutes. The probablility that the atom has tunneled is 50%. So you may see it move or not. Either way would be consistent with the rules of reality. However, if the chance ends up landing on that it hadn't moved after 30 minutes, the probablility scale resets from time A, because we have once again observed the particle in state A, and the probability of the particle moving from state or location A to state or location B resets back to 0% to 100% over the next 1 hour.
It's not that we are necssarily ""suspending"" the motion of the particle by measuring it. It's that the closer you make a subsequent measurement of particle A in state or location A following the initial measurement at time A, the lower the probability that the particle will have changed its state or location. The probabilities of a change in state reset to 0 once you measure that the particle has remained in state/location A.
Such is the rule of a virtual reality.
EDIT: Decoherence theory is not a good answer as to why there should exist a probability distribution of particles(information) in the first place, or even why the probability collapses into reality upon measurement (if it was, quantum erasure experiments wouldn't work the way they do). And it definitely doesn't explain entanglement (non-locality).";0;3pw7xy;[]

""It is easy to show using standard theory that if a system starts in an eigenstate of some observable, and measurements are made of that observable N times a second, then, even if the state is not a stationary one, the probability that the system will be in the same state after, say, one second, tends to one as N tends to infinity; that is, that continual observations will prevent motion ""
This effect isn't as profound as I thought. It's essentially derived from the theory that if you observe an event that takes, say a second to finish, N times during the duration of the event (1 second), that 1 second will never finish. This makes sense, because to fit infinity observations into a time frame of one second doesn't make any real practical sense. Can someone help me understand why this quantum proof is of importance?

I would like to dispel this misconception. Perhaps in this experiment it was just light bouncing off of electrons, it's not clear. But in general even if the light does not interact with the electrons, we can still make a measurement of their position. Consider a scenario where an electron can be in one of two places, and you shine light on the place where the electron isn't, and you find that there is no electron there, then you have measured the position of the electron, without interacting with it. The quantum zeno effect applies to this scenario as well. Consider a tunneling experiment, where an electron is on one side of a very high potential, and it quantum tunnels through this barrier. Suppose there is some typical time scale where the electron is expected to tunnel through the barrier, say 1 second. According to quantum theory, if we measure the side of the potential where the electron isn't, by firing photons into the empty space, the electrons tunneling will be suppressed. This can not be understood as the photons interacting with the electron, it is a uniquely quantum effect where having **information** about the position of the electron plays a role in its physical behaviour. Or to put it another way, it appears as though merely the **potential** for interaction influences the behaviour of a system. From a philosophical and metaphysical perspective this is in fact completely unprecedented, very hard to get your head around, and totally undermines traditionally acceped world views.;0;3pw7xy;[]

IBM is claiming that in the next three years, they are not only going to make quantum computers stable and affordable for the average business customer, they are also going to increase their current power by 31x.
&#x200B;
I'd love to see the business plan on this one. A single D-Wave cost 15 million in 2017. Who do you get to program and run it? Do they still have to be kept at a temperature colder than outer space to function? What software will exist for it?

Quantum computers are PURE HYPE right now. Vaporware. They exist in a quantum state of ""maybe this will be awesome one day"", while CEO's make impossible promises and wild claims to secure investment money and please ignorant stock holders. &#x200B;
They also exist because Moore's Law is deader than disco, and we need the illusion of constant progression and expansion for our system to keep functioning. We've plateaued. The internet is a Potemkin Village. There comes a point where if you aren't rising, you are falling. This is a fiction that can always be ""on the horizon"" though. People will buy it.";0;uqrlu7;[]

The only thing that Watson AI was even tacitly involved in was calculating a clinical risk score that, in our own analysis, barely competed with Medicare's HCC risk scoring. It was one of the most frustrating projects I've ever worked on as a developer.
We wound up canceling our $2M contract only a year in because of this. Other major health networks did the same and abandoned their multi-million-dollar investments in the platform.

It requires extraordinary cooling machinery that only science labs can operate and maintain, because these chips need to be near 0 Kelvin to work.

Furthermore, if the wavefunctions of atomic particles could be determined using a harsh method, how could you even guarantee the results you are getting are accurate... in other words, you cannot prove something by using itself, its a circular logical argument.

Second author of the paper here. To clarify a bit: we used weak but faithful quantum measurements to estimate the phase of the oscillation of the qubit, and then used that weak measurement record to condition a feedback signal that locks the quantum oscillation of the qubit to a classical reference. What's really novel about this work is closing a feedback loop on a quantum system.

If you entangle two particles (A and B), separate them, and then cause particle B to collapse, Einstein's ""spooky action at a distance"" kicks in and causes particle A to collapse in the opposite spin. The guy holding particle A doesn't know it has collapsed yet and by reading it, he risks collapsing A if it hasn't. This makes any quantum communication useful in terms of tampering (because we will know if it has been intercepted), but doesn't provide you with the ability to communicate instantly across distances, even though the waveform collapse happens instantly. Any communication must be verified with a normal method bound by the speed of light.
If you can read the position without disturbing it, then the tampering prevention feature goes away, but who cares? We'd have interstellar, instantaneous communication and maybe even the ability to communicate across time.
**TL;DR: Be skeptical, but if it's true it might give us instant communication across the universe**

The cat is either dead or alive. It is never both, and checking it is not what causes the uncertainty to resolve.

As a scientist in this field I am compelled to say that this article very badly represents the facts and implications of the experiment that was done. Quantum states are not ""collapsed"" or ""uncollapsed."" The degree of collapse is directly related to (and actually caused by) the amount of information extracted from the system.
The reason it is hard to make measurements with extract a small amount of information is that you usually have so many extra degrees of freedom interacting with your detector that you can't separate the information coming from the intended system from information coming from the environment. This environmental information is normally called ""noise."" What's special about the experiment here is that the Berkeley team made an amplifier so good that it picks up almost zero noise. The article's claim that this was the first experiment to make a weak enough measurement that the quantum state survived is incorrect. What's true is that they made very weak measurements with signal to noise ratio high enough that those measurements actually provided useful information, which could then be used to create a sensible feedback signal.";0;10yemu;[]

What?
So they take the value of 1 or 0, you just don't know which state they are in at a certain point in time unelss you measure them? Doh? How does this mean they are both 1 and 0 simultaneously!??!?
Similarly, a hypothetical wall that is being painted a different colour each day is actually all colours simultaneously, until you look at it and see which colour it is at that point?
What? No. It's only 1 colour at a time. You just don't know which one unless you look at it. I think they're putting this way too simply. It doesn't make sense.";0;10yemu;[]
